Abstract 
B cells are key pathogenic drivers of chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
There is limited understanding of the relationship between synovial B cell subsets and 
pathogenic antibody secreting cells (ASCs). This knowledge is crucial for the development of 
targeted therapies. Here, we combine flow cytometry of circulating B cells with single-cell 
RNA and paired repertoire sequencing of over 27,000 synovial B cells from patients with 
established RA. Twelve B cell clusters were identified including previously recognised 
subsets, and a novel cluster that strongly expressed heat shock proteins. All lineages 
identified by trajectory analysis contribute to the DN2 B cell population, which is the major 
precursor to synovial ASCs. This was further supported by B cell receptor (BCR) lineage 
analysis, which revealed clonal relationships between DN2 cells and ASCs. This study 
advances our understanding of B cells in RA and reveals the origin of pathogenic ASCs in the 
RA synovium.

Introduction 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the commonest autoimmune mediated inflammatory arthritis affecting 
about 1% of the world’s population.  As well as chronic, severe pain and early joint destruction, 
patients experience marked fatigue, accelerated cardiovascular disease and premature death (1, 2). 
Despite the heterogenous clinical presentation, the importance of B cells in disease pathogenesis 
has been established, and further reinforced by the success of B cell depleting therapies (BCDT) (3, 
4). Pathogenic B cells contribute to the chronic synovial inflammation in at least three ways; cytokine 
secretion, antigen presentation, and autoantibody production (5). In RA, B cell dysregulation occurs 
long before clinical disease onset, and BCDT has been shown to delay the onset of clinical disease in 
preclinical patients (6, 7). Circulating autoantibodies to self-antigens that include, but are not limited 
to, citrullinated auto-antigens (ACPA) are present years before arthritis becomes clinically evident (8, 
9). Immune complexes formed with self-antigens become trapped within the cartilage of synovial 
joints, activating innate immune cells, that drive inflammation and joint damage. Within the 
diseased synovium the most common histological pathotype is dominated by the presence of B cells, 
that both serve as the main antigen presenting cell (APC) to T cells and secrete pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (10).  
 
Although BCDT can be beneficial in treating RA, it is non-specific, depleting all CD20+ve B cells. This 
results in the loss of not only pathogenic B cells, but also protective B cells, which are vital for tissue 
homeostasis and infection control. The importance of the latter was borne out during the SARS-CoV-
2 pandemic where mortality and morbidity was significantly increased in patients with 
autoimmunity, who had received BCDT prior to infection. In addition, the protective effect from 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was reduced in these patients (11-14). This highlights the need for more 
selective therapies that target only pathogenic B cells. Such therapies can only be developed when 
the identity of autoimmune B cells, particularly those that serve as precursors to synovial CD20-ve 
antibody secreting cells (ASCs) is known and so delineating these cells is an urgent priority. 
 
Single cell analysis of the rheumatoid synovium has previously identified 4 B cell subsets, including 
naïve B cells, memory, double negative B cells and terminally differentiated antibody secreting cells 
(ASCs) (15). However, the inter-relatedness of these subsets is poorly understood and importantly, 
the major precursor to rheumatoid synovial CD20-ve ASCs has not been established. 
 
“Double negative” (DN) refers to a subset of antigen experienced B cells, that lack expression of both 
CD27 and IgD. They are further divided into DN1 and DN2 cells of which the latter have high

expression of CD19, CD11c and the transcription factor T-bet, but lack the expression of CD21 and 
CXCR5. Whilst DN1 B cells represent the majority of DN B cells in healthy subjects, DN2 B cells are 
increased in the elderly, during chronic infection (including hepatitis C, malaria, and HIV) (16-21) and 
following influenza vaccination (22, 23). Most recently they have been linked to severe and fatal 
outcomes from COVID-19 infection, suggesting that they have prominent pro-inflammatory 
functions (24).  
 
DN2 B cells substantially increased in the circulation of patients with active systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), where they are extra-follicular precursors to antibody secreting cells (ASCs) 
and correlate with increased disease activity and poorer outcomes (21). They have also been 
reported in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn’s disease (25-28). We 
previously observed a significant increase in the frequency of circulating class switched IgG+ve DN2 
cells in RA patients. These B cells also expressed significantly fewer mutations in the B cell receptor 
(BCR) and were enriched in the synovium, suggesting an extrafollicular origin (29). We considered 
that naïve B cells entering the synovium were induced to mature into antibody secreting cells via the 
generation of DN2 cells in extrafollicular areas. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed 
assessment of circulating and synovial B cells in rheumatoid arthritis and to identify the main 
precursors to pathogenic ASCs in the diseased synovium. In addition, by utilising single cell 
sequencing and RNA velocity we aimed to define the interrelatedness of the identified synovial B cell 
subsets.

Results 
 
DN2 cells are enriched in the blood and synovium of RA patients.  
To fully characterize rheumatoid B cells, a cohort of 29 RA patients and 15 matched healthy controls 
were selected for full spectrum flow cytometry (Supplementary Table 1). We studied all known B cell 
subsets in the blood (Supplementary Table 4). In agreement with our previous studies, double 
negative-2 (DN2) cells were increased in the circulation of RA patients when compared to healthy 
controls (means with 95% confidence intervals were 1.51% ± 0.3 vs 0.76% ± 0.38, P=0.0003) (Fig. 1A-
B). In addition, DN2 B cell precursors, called activated naïve B cells (aNAV), that are IgD+ve CD27-ve 
CD21-ve CD24-ve CD38-ve (21), were almost doubled in frequency in the blood of RA patients compared 
to the healthy controls (2.35% ± 0.76 vs. 1.13% ± 0.45, P=0.0091) (Fig. 1C). The characteristic surface 
markers of DN2 cells, that delineate them from both naïve and memory B cells, including CD11c, 
CD21, CD24 and CD73, established their full phenotype and the expression of both HLA-DR and CD86 
suggested an enhanced capacity to act as APCs (Fig. 1D). Importantly, DN2 B cells constituted a 
significantly higher proportion of synovial B cells compared with that of DN2s in the circulating B cell 
population. (3.02% ± 1.97 vs. 12.0% ± 6.46, P=0.0257) (Fig. 1E). In health, the frequency of circulating 
DN1 B cells predominates over DN2 B cells. However, in RA patients the ratio of circulating DN2 to 
DN1 B cells was increased compared to healthy controls (0.338 ± 0.106 vs. 0.101 ± 0.04, P<0.0001), 
due to the expansion of the DN2 B cell population (Fig. 1F). The proportion of DN2 cells in the 
circulation did not correlate with age, suggesting that these cells are distinct from the more broadly 
described age-associated B cells (Fig. 1G).

Single-cell sequencing of synovial B cells reveals the heterogeneity of B cells in the rheumatoid 
joint.  
Highly purified synovial B cells (CD19+ve CD14-ve CD3-ve) were isolated from the joints of 3 seropositive 
patients with established RA at arthroplasty (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Single cell RNA sequencing 
 
(scRNA-seq) was carried out using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform to obtain paired 
transcriptomic and BCR sequence data for each cell (Fig. 2A). In total, data for 27,053 synovial B cells 
were analysed, 7,825 of which had productive heavy and light chain BCR sequence information. 
 These cells clustered into 12 distinct subsets that were annotated according to known markers and 
signatures (Fig.2B, Supplementary Fig. S1B-C).  
 
Naïve B cells (split into Naïve 1 and Naïve 2) comprised just over a quarter of all B cells (7,295 B cells; 
26.9% of total) (Fig. 2B and 2C). IGHD expression was found primarily in these clusters alongside 
minimal expression of CD27, matching the canonical surface markers used to identify naïve B cells by 
flow cytometry. Compared to the Naïve 2 cluster, the Naïve 1 cluster differs by the increased 
expression of BACH2 and CD83 and the reduced expression of FCER2 (CD23) (Fig. 2D), suggesting 
that the Naïve 1 B cells may be recently activated.  
 
Memory B cells were identified by the increased expression of CD27 and totaled 9,251 (34.2%). This 
population was further split into switched or unswitched according to BCR isotype. A small 
population of B cells (604 cells, 2.2%) expresses high levels of CCR7 compared to the other clusters 
and were defined as being in a state of early activation. The increased expression of CD83, IRF4, 
CD69, EGR1 and EGR3 also suggests that cells within this cluster have been recently activated (Fig. 
2D). 
 
6.9% (1,891 of all B cells) expressed high levels of ITGAX (CD11c), as well as FCRL5, CD86, SOX5, and 
MS4A1 (CD20) (Fig. 2D & 2E), which are hallmarks of DN2 cells. Cells within this cluster lack 
expression of CD27, FCER2 (CD23) and CR2 (CD21), which is consistent with the DN2 population 
identified using full-spectrum flow cytometry.

JCHAIN+ve ASCs made up just over 21% of the total B cell population (5,786 cells) and encompassed 
three separate clusters (ASC 1, ASC 2, and ASC 3). As expected, the ASC clusters sit separately from 
the other B cell clusters, expressing high levels of JCHAIN and PRDM1 (BLIMP1). The latter is an 
important regulator of ASC differentiation, that promotes the expression of XBP1 and represses B 
cell transcription factors. Three separate ASC clusters were identified and showed distinct levels of 
CD38, CD27, PRDM1 and NEAT1 expression (Fig. 2D). The higher expression of NEAT1, a MYC-
regulated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes proliferation, in the ASC 1 cluster suggests 
that these cells are proliferating and have a more plasmablast-like phenotype. The ASC 2 cluster 
expresses the most PPIB (that forms complexes facilitating protein folding) and JCHAIN, both of 
which are involved in the unfolded protein response, that is activated during periods of high 
antibody production due to the immense stress on the cells. B cells from the ASC 3 cluster have the 
lowest average expression of ASC related genes implying terminal differentiation and exhaustion 
(Fig. 2D). 
 
A novel cluster of 1,708 (6.3%) B cells expressed high levels of heat shock protein (HSP) genes and 
are called henceforth HSP+ve B cells. Although an increase in HSPs has been reported in the synovial 
fluid of RA patients, the subset of immune cells producing them has not been identified (30). The B 
cells in the HSP+ve cluster expressed high levels of HSP genes including HSPA1A, HSPA6, HSPA1B, and 
HSPB1 (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3A). The high expression of HSPs is linked to the misfolded 
protein response and de novo protein folding pathways (Supplementary Fig. S3B).  
 
Smaller additional populations include 361 (1.3%) MME+ve (CD10) transitional cells and 157 (0.6%) 
cell-cycling B cells (Fig.2B). All clusters were present in each of the samples; however, the ASC 
clusters were primarily composed of cells from Sample 1 (68% of ASCs). The proportion of DN2 cells 
was similar across the three samples, with RA1 having 6.8%, RA2 having 7.8%, and RA3 having 5.6%. 
(Fig.2C).

DN2 cells are a heterogenous group of cells, primed to present antigen and become ASCs.  
Differential expression analysis showed that the DN2 cluster was enriched in the expression of ITGAX 
(CD11c), SOX5, ZEB2, DUSP4, FCRL5, LRMP, HOPX, CD86 and NEAT1, matching previous reports of 
DN2 cells in humans and CD21lo B cells in mice (21, 31) (Fig.3A). SOX5 is a transcription factor linked 
to the late stages of B cell differentiation and has previously been found to be enriched in CD21lo and 
atypical memory B cells which share features with DN2 cells (32). ZEB2 has also been previously 
linked to autoimmune B cells as it directly binds the promotor of ITGAX. We compared this data to 
FACS sorted bulk RNA-seq data from DN2 cells of SLE patients (21) as well as the homologous mouse 
CD21lo CD23lo B cell population (31). Projecting the location of cells with a module score in the top 
10% onto the UMAP confirmed that these expression patterns overlap with the DN2 cluster in this 
dataset, as well as the ASC2 and ASC3 clusters (Fig.3B).  Further GSEA analysis using the GO 
Biological pathways revealed strong enrichment for pathways related to antigen processing and 
presentation, particularly exogenous antigens via MHC Class II, due to the increased expression of 
CD86 and HLA genes including HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 (Fig. 3C).  
 
Re-clustering of the 1,891 DN2 cells further revealed two distinct populations, DN2-A and DN2-B 
(Fig. 3D). DN2-A differentially expressed HLA-DQA1, which affects the loading of peptide antigens 
onto class II molecules for presentation to T cells, implying that DN2-A B cells are primed to present 
antigen and activate CD4+ve T cells. DN2-A B cells also expressed higher levels of genes related to cell 
survival and quiescence such as KLF2 and JUND. In contrast, DN2-B cells expressed higher levels of 
JCHAIN, IGHG1, IGHA1, and IL2RG indicating that they are transitioning into ASCs (Fig. 3E-F).

Trajectory inference shows DN2 cells are ASC precursors in the RA synovium. 
As the source of autoreactive antibodies that form immune complexes, ASCs are a major contributor 
to inflammation and tissue damage within the joint. To delineate the developmental processes 
within the joint and pinpoint the main precursors of ASCs we have used a combination of RNA 
velocity and trajectory inference. RNA velocity analysis with scVelo (33) revealed that mature B cell 
clusters evolve into DN2 cells with a subsequent onward flow towards ASC clusters (Fig. 4A). 
Trajectory inference with Slingshot (34) revealed three separate lineages (Fig. 4B). Lineage 1 starting 
in the Naïve 1 cluster, transitioning through the non-switched B cell clusters into the switched 
memory clusters before merging into DN2 cells, and finally differentiating into ASCs. Lineage 2 
begins in the Cell-Cycling cluster, to Switched-Memory, to DN2, to ASC. Finally, Lineage 3 starts in 
the Early Activation cluster before joining Lineage 1 in the Non-Switched Memory cluster to DN2 
cells and then to ASCs.  
 
Changes of gene expression along Lineage 1 can be clustered into 5 groups. The genes in Group 1 
peak in expression early in the trajectory in the Naïve 1 cluster. Then, group 2 contains genes that 
are expressed in mature B cells and includes the cytokine genes CSF1 and LTA. Group 3 contains 
genes that begin to be upregulated in the DN2 cluster and into the ASCs. This group contains 
SLAMF1 that is upregulated upon activation in B cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation 
into ASCs. Group 4 contains typical ASC gene markers such as JCHAIN, SDC1 (CD138), SLAMF7, 
PRDM1 (BLIMP-1), and CD38 which all peak in expression as the cells begin to transition into ASCs.

Finally, group 5 contains genes which peak at the very end of the differentiation into ASCs, including 
DNAJB4 which is involved in ensuring correct protein folding and BMP6, that helps to inhibit 
proliferation in terminally differentiated cells (Fig. 4D). 
 
The expression of several of the important genes for the differentiation of ASCs like NEAT1, MZB1, 
JCHAIN begin to increase in the DN2 cluster (Fig. 4E). S100A11 increases in the DN2 cluster as they 
become ASCs (Fig. 4E) and is known to be elevated in the synovial fluid and tissue of RA patients, 
though its cellular source was previously unknown (35). 
 
To further understand the transition between DN2 and ASC clusters, we carried out clustering of 
only the DN2 cells (1,891 cells) and the ASCs (5,786 cells) together. Within this subset, Slingshot 
identified 1 lineage starting at the HLA-DQA2high DN2-A cluster, before passing through the JCHAINhigh 
DN2-B cluster into the ASC cluster (Fig 4F). When looking at the expression of MS4A1 and JCHAIN 
there is a clear gradient showing the decrease in CD20 and the increase of JCHAIN as the cells 
differentiate into ASCs (Fig. 4G).

BCR sequences from synovial B cells show hallmarks of autoimmunity. 
To further understand the diversity of BCRs present in the inflamed rheumatoid joint, the paired BCR 
repertoire sequences were evaluated, specifically looking at characteristics linked to autoimmunity. 
The mean IGH CDR3 lengths were similar across the three samples with Sample 1 having a mean 
CDR3 length of 18.3 amino acids, Sample 2 18.0, and Sample 3 17.5 amino acids (Fig. 5A). Over a 
quarter (26.2%) of all IGK CDR3s are over 11 amino acids long, which has previously been linked to 
autoimmunity and poly-reactivity (36). 
 
As expected, the naïve clusters primarily expressed unmutated IGHM and IGHD with IGHA and IGHG 
being expressed in the memory and ASC clusters where class switching has occurred after activation. 
(Fig. 5B). As B cells become activated both the mutation rate and proportion of class-switched cells 
increases, with this being evident at the border between the Naïve 2 and the memory clusters (Fig. 
5B and 5C). Despite the expected increase in mutation rate, unmutated sequences were present in 
all the clusters. In particular, 19% of the DN2 cells expressed BCR sequences which are identical to 
germline sequences (Fig. 5C). Low mutation rates persisted in some of the terminally differentiated 
ASCs, suggesting development out with germinal centres. 
 
For the class-switched sequences there is predominantly a unimodal distribution of mutations 
peaking around 5% mutation frequency but extending up to 25%. The majority of IGHM sequences 
remain unmutated or poorly mutated with an average mutation frequency of 3% compared to 5% in

BCR sequences from DN2 cells share identical CDR3 sequences with ASCs. 
We analysed the BCR sequences in the synovium to investigate clonal relationships. The synovial B 
cells showed a high degree of clonal expansion, with 62.4% and 40.2% of clones being expanded 
(clone size ≥R2) in Samples 1 and 2, respectively. Sample 3 was less clonal, with only 9.1% of clones 
consisting of at least two cells (Fig. 6A and 6B). To further compare the degree of clonal expansion 
between the three patients we used the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality. A Gini coefficient 
of 0 indicates maximal diversity or an equal abundance of each sequence, whereas 1 indicates 
extreme inequality. In concordance with the proportion of expanded clones, Sample 1 had the 
highest Gini coefficient (0.33) followed by Sample 2 (0.21), with Sample 3 having a much lower value 
(0.03). 
 
There was no relationship between the size of the clonal group and the rate of mutation. The largest 
clonal group in Sample 1 contained 87 class switched IgG1 cells and the most mutated sequence had 
just 4 mutations in the heavy variable sequence, whereas a smaller group with 14 cells had up to 52 
mutations (Supplementary Fig. S4A).  
 
Having identified (through trajectory inference and RNA velocity) that DN2 cells are a precursor to 
ASCs, we explored the relationship between the BCR sequences in these clusters. 4 clonal groups 
had an identical heavy CDR3 amino acid sequence between a DN2 B cell and an ASC (Fig. 6C and 6D). 
These direct links, ending at an ASC, originated from 4 DN2 cells, 2 Switched Memory cells, 1 Naïve 2 
cell and 4 Cell-Cycling cells, demonstrating again that DN2 cells are the primary precursor to ASCs 
(Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Discussion 
This is the most detailed exploration to date of both circulating and synovial B cells subsets in 
patients with RA. By combining trajectory inference and RNA velocity we have mapped the 
maturation of naïve B cells to ASCs. We show that the B cell clusters are intimately linked from naïve 
through memory to DN2 cells and critically, that DN2 cells serve as the major precursors to synovial 
ASCs. In addition, DN2 B cells expressed potent APC capacity and are therefore likely to represent an 
important pathogenic B cell subset that should be targeted for future therapies.  
 
DN2 B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of a related autoimmune rheumatic disease, 
SLE, where they are enriched in blood, being epigenetically poised to respond to TLR7 ligands and 
serve as the pathogenic precursors to ASCs (21). We have previously observed that DN2 B cells were 
enriched in both the blood and synovium of RA patients (28), and confirmed this finding in a second, 
independent cohort of 29 patients. Indeed, we found both circulating DN2 B cells and their 
precursors aNAVs are almost twice as frequent in RA patients. This is supported by previous reports 
that see an elevation of DN B cells in the blood (37, 38). This increase can be explained by a change 
in the dominant subtype in RA. We have found that the ratio of DN1 to DN2 B cells is reversed in RA 
so that the frequency of DN2 B cells as a percentage of all B cells is higher, whilst the DN1 frequency 
itself does not change. Hence to identify a significant elevation in pathogenic DN2 B cells, all the 
available markers to differentiate DN1 and DN2 B cells must be included and DN B cells should not 
be treated as a single population. 
 
DN2 cells were present in the blood of healthy controls, albeit at very low numbers. A recent single 
cell study assessed the immune compartments of 16 tissues (not including the synovium) from 12 
adult donors. They identified a B cell subset referred to as Age Associated B cells (ABCs), that has a 
similar transcriptional profile to our DN2 cluster, including high expression of ITGAX and low 
expression of CR2 (CD21) and CD27 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). They found that DN2 cells were 
primarily found in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow (32). DN2 cells are clearly important in health 
but dramatically increase in autoimmune conditions and viral infections, as we have shown in RA 
and others have demonstrated in patients with SLE, HIV, and COVID-19 (18, 21, 24).  
 
By assessing 27,000 synovial B cells we were able to identify 12 B cell clusters, comprised of 2 naïve, 
2 memory, 3 ASC, the DN2 clusters along with 4 much smaller clusters. One of these smaller clusters 
was entirely novel and expressed heat shock proteins (HSPs) from the HSP70 family. In RA, serum 
levels of HSP-70 are about twice the level of healthy controls and significantly elevated in the

synovium (39). Whilst their main role is to reverse or inhibit denaturation or unfolding of cellular 
proteins in response to stress, they are associated with an increased frequency of Th17 T cells and 
the Th17/Treg ratio (40). It’s possible that this B cell cluster may be a significant source of serum and 
synovial tissue HSPs, given that B cell lines readily release HSP70 via exosomes (41). The role this 
HSP+ve B cell subset is playing in the pathogenesis of RA is unknown but deserves closer scrutiny in 
follow up studies.  
 
Two other studies utilising single cell sequencing of rheumatoid synovial B cells have been reported. 
In the first just over 1000 B cells were available for analysis (from 21 subjects with established RA). 
Here four synovial B cell subsets were identified, that included naïve, memory, plasmablasts and 
DN2 B cells, (that were referred to as autoimmune B cells or ABCs in the study) (15). Of note the 
ABCs were derived largely from tissue samples that were leukocyte rich and expressed the 
interferon stimulated genes GBP1 and ISG15. As we also selected samples that were leukocyte rich 
(by flow cytometry), the presence of DN2 B cells may be a particular feature of this synovial 
pathotype and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other histological synovial phenotypes, in 
particular the leukocyte poor and macrophage rich subtypes (10, 42, 43). Of note, leukocyte rich 
synovium is associated with the highest inflammation scores clinically and so patients with this 
phenotype are most likely to benefit from targeted B cell depletion (10).  
 
A further study of newly diagnosed, untreated RA patients assessed just under 2000 B cells from 3 
RA patients, 2 of whom were seronegative for antibodies directed at citrullinated autoantigens (i.e., 
ACPA-ve). Here there was no enrichment of ITGAX+ve (encoding CD11c) or CD27-ve IgD-ve B cells (44). 
The difference between these observations and our study may relate to the early stage of RA and 
the limited number of B cells assessed with the predominance of ACPA-ve RA donors in that study. 
However, our previous observation of circulating B cells in newly diagnosed, untreated RA patients 
clearly showed a significant increase in DN2 B cells, which suggests that even at this early stage, DN2 
B cells are a prominent B cell subset and may also be expected to be enriched in the synovium (29). 
 
A real strength of this study lies in the opportunity to understand the inter-relatedness of RA 
synovial B cells. RNA velocity and trajectory inference identified how the clusters of B cells exist in a 
dynamic continuum.  We observed 3 separate lineages, beginning with naïve B cells, cell cycling B 
cells or the early activation cluster. B cells developed into memory cells before maturing into DN2 B 
cells and eventually pathogenic ASCs. Clearly the RA synovium can support the generation of ASCs 
from all three starting points; but all lineages can lead to DN2 B cells.

Previous reports allude to the heterogeneity of autoantibodies that form immune complexes within 
the joint (8). Similar immune complexes can be found in the joints of patients with osteoarthritis but 
exist at much higher frequencies in RA synovium (8). The paired BCR sequencing data has 
strengthened the findings of the RNA velocity analysis and provided an extra layer of detail by 
tracking B cell clonal lineages based on CDR3 sequence identity. Furthermore, having clonal families 
containing diverse combinations of B cell subsets including both naïve B cells and ASCs suggests that 
the immunological response is local to the joint and naïve cells are migrating to the joint where they 
then become activated. This is supported by another single cell sequencing study of rheumatoid 
synovial B cells where over 50% of the plasma cells were derived from clonal families that also 
contained memory B cells (44). 
 
DN2 cells express CD11c, that is driven by the expression of the transcription factor T-bet. The 
expression of high levels of T-bet in B cells requires the synergistic engagement of the BCR, TLR7 and 
IFNγ (45). Our data shows that, as well as differentially expressing ITGAX, synovial DN2 cells highly 
express DUSP4, that encodes a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily. 
DUSP4 is related to the TLR7/8 cascade thorough its involvement in the MyD88 pathway, further 
strengthening the link between TLR7 signalling and DN2 B cells (46, 47). Interestingly autophagy 
plays an essential role in delivering RNA ligands to the endosomes where TLR7 resides (48). 
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an established therapy for RA, inhibits both TLR7 signalling and 
autophagy, so HCQ may preferentially constrain the function of DN2 B cells at multiple levels (49, 
50). The most differentially expressed gene was SOX5 gene, that is a member of the Sox family of 
transcription factors linked to cell fate (51, 52). It has previously been reported that CD11c+ve B cells 
express both DUSP4 and SOX5 and our study supports that observation (53). This transcription factor 
decreases the proliferative capacity of B cells whilst permitting plasmablast generation (32). Hence 
expression of SOX5 may licence the evolution of DN2 cells into ASCs. 
 
Synovial DN2 cells can be further divided into two further clusters, that we refer to as DN2-A cells 
and DN2-B. DN2-A cells are specialised for antigen processing and presentation (APCs), where they 
likely solicit the appropriate help from synovial T cells. Following this, they downregulate APC 
function and upregulate expression of JCHAIN, IGHG1, IGHA1, and IL2RG as they evolve into DN2-B 
cells, that in turn merges into the ASC cluster. As DN2-A and DN2-B cells function as either APCs or 
precursors of ASCs, they fulfil at least two of the known criteria for being pathogenic. In contrast,

they express few transcripts for cytokines, though we saw no distinct pattern for cytokine 
production in any of the synovial B cell clusters (Supplementary Fig. S5). 
 
In this study we have shown that DN2 cells are a major precursor to pathogenic ASCs in the RA 
synovium. We also found that they are primed to present antigen and activate autoreactive T cells. 
These results fill a gap in our understanding of B cell development in the synovial tissue of RA 
patients. To fully define the pathogenicity of this B cell subset the antigen specificity of these cells 
will need to be determined in future studies. Identifying the critical role of DN2 cells in the 
generation of ASCs provides a novel target for developing future therapeutics.

Materials and Methods 
Patients  
The use of human samples was approved by the South East Scotland Bioresource NHS Ethical Review 
Board (Ref. 15/ES/0094) and the use of healthy donor blood was approved by AMREC (Ref. 21-
EMREC-041). Informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to sample collection. 
The patient characteristics are described in Supplementary Table 1.  
 
Cell Isolation  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from total blood using Histopaque-1077 
separation according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). The PBMCs were collected, 
washed in PBS, and counted. PBMCs were resuspended in resuspension media (RPMI-1640 (Gibco) 
supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin, with 40% 
foetal calf serum (FCS)) then an equal volume of freezing media (resuspension media supplemented 
with 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Fisher Reagents)) was added to give final density of 10x106/ml 
in 15% DMSO. The sample was then frozen to -80°C in a Mr Frosty Freezing Container (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) then stored in liquid nitrogen until further use.   
 
Synovial tissue was collected from RA patients undergoing arthroplasty. The fresh tissue was 
dissected followed by digestion for 2 hours at 37°C in 1 mg ml−1 Collagenase 1 (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Debris was removed and cells isolated by sequentially passing through 100, 70 and 40μm cell 
strainers (Corning). The isolated cells were then frozen and stored in the same way as the PBMCs.   
 
Full spectrum flow cytometry  
PBMC and synovial tissue samples were thawed and resuspended according to the 10X protocol (10X 
Genomics). Briefly, cryovials were removed from liquid nitrogen and thawed rapidly in a water bath 
at 37°C. The cells were sequentially diluted 5 times with warm media with 1:1 incremental volume 
addition added in a dropwise manner, gently swirling between each volume. The cell suspension was 
centrifuged at 230xg for 6 minutes then washed in PBS. A 40μm cell strainer was used to remove 
debris before the cells were washed and stained in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% FCS) at 
room temperature for 20 minutes with fluorescently conjugated antibodies as described in 
Supplementary Table 2. Cells were washed and re-suspended in FACS buffer and analysed using a 
Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) and FCS Express (v7.14, De Novo Software).

10X Run and Sequencing  
Synovial tissue samples were thawed and resuspended according to the 10X protocol as described 
above. Cells were washed and then stained in FACS buffer at 4°C for 20 minutes with fluorescently 
conjugated antibodies as described in Supplementary Table 3. Single CD19+ve DAPI-ve CD3-ve CD14-ve B 
cells were then sorted with the FACS Aria II and FACSDiva 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences). The full gating 
strategy is shown in Supplementary Figure S1A. Immediately after sorting the CD19+ve B cells were 
processed through the Chromium Single Cell Platform using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5' 
Kit v2 (10X Genomics, PN- 1000265), the Chromium Single Cell Human BCR Amplification Kit (10X 
Genomics, PN-1000253), and the Chromium Next GEM Chip K Single Cell Kit (10X Genomics, PN-
1000287) as per manufacture’s protocol. GEX and V(D)J libraries were then sequenced using the 
NextSeq2000 at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility's Genetics Core in Edinburgh.   
 
Data pre-processing  
The FASTQ files were processed using Cell Ranger (10X Genomics, v7.0.0) and aligned to the GRCh38 
reference genome using the cellranger multi command. The raw feature matrices were loaded into R 
(v4.1.0) using the Seurat (v4.1.0) package (54). Each sample was pre-processed separately before 
integration using Harmony (v0.1) (55). Cells that expressed fewer than 200 distinct genes, more than 
2500 distinct genes, or had more than 5% mitochondrial reads were removed in order to exclude 
potential multiplets and dead cells. Contaminating non-B cells were then excluded by removing cells 
expressing CD3E, CD14, GNLY, FCER1A, GCGR3A (CD16), LYZ, or PPBP.  Following quality control the 
three samples had 9,044, 11,840, and 6,169 cells. Gene counts were then log-normalised with 
default parameters and the top 2,000 variable features for each sample were identified using 
Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function. To prevent expression of genes associated with individual 
BCR clonotypes from influencing dimensionality reduction and clustering, immunoglobulin related 
genes, including all heavy and light VDJ genes and constant region genes, were removed from the 
variable features list (1761 variable features remained). 
 
Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, and Differential Expression  
Unsupervised clustering based on the first 20 principal components of the most variably expressed 
genes was performed using Seurat::FindNeighbours and Seurat::FindClusters with the resolution 0.5. 
Clusters were visualised using the manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method and 
annotated by analysing the expression of canonical cell markers, SingleR (56), and the use of pre-
made gene sets from bulk RNA-seq of sorted B cell populations downloaded from MSigDB (v7.5.1)

(57). Differential gene expression between clusters was examined using the MAST test using 
Seurat::FindMarkers, the results are reported as volcano plots created with EnhancedVolcano (v1.1).  
 
Module Scores and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  
Module scores were created using the Seurat::AddModuleScore function. The Human SLE DN2 gene 
signature was generated using the normalised gene expression data from GSE92387 (15), the data 
was downloaded and analysed using the SARtools R package (58). The top DEGs with >1.5 log2FC 
were then used as the input list for Seurat::AddModuleScore creating a module score for each cell. 
The mouse CD21lo CD23lo gene signature was generated using the differentially expressed genes in 
CD21lo CD23lo cells relative to follicular B cells (full gene list provided in personal correspondence) 
(19). The module score was created as before but with the top DEGs with >2.5 log2FC. The module 
scores were then used as features in Seurat::FeaturePlot, and contour plots layered over to show the 
cells within the top 10% for each module score. 
 
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out using fgsea (v1.21) (59). Gene Ontology (GO) 
gene sets were downloaded from MSigDB (v7.5.1). The differentially expressed genes identified by 
Seurat::FindMarkers were ranked by log2 fold change and used as the input. The GSEA results were 
reported with the normalised enrichment score (NES).  
 
Trajectory Inference and RNA Velocity  
Trajectory inference was performed using Slingshot (v2.2) (34). Slingshot uses the clusters identified 
by Seurat in an unsupervised manner to construct a minimum spanning tree which is then converted 
into smooth lineages aligning cells to a pseudotime trajectory. Trajectory-based differential gene 
expression analysis was carried out using tradeseq (v1.17) (60) and the lineages identified by 
Slingshot given as input.  
 
RNA Velocity analysis was performed using Velocyto (v0.17) (61) and scVelo (v 0.2.4) (33). Velocyto 
was used to identify spliced and unspliced transcripts within the Cellranger output. The resulting 
loom output file was then merged with the cluster annotation and dimensionality reduction 
metadata, previously generated in the Seurat analysis, using scVelo. RNA velocities were estimated 
using the dynamical model from scVelo and projected onto the UMAP.

BCR Analysis  
BCR repertoire data were processed using the Immcantation framework. Initial VDJ assignment was 
carried out using IgBLAST (v1.18.0) (62) with the aid of the AssignGenes.py wrapper and output was 
formatted using MakeDb.py, both scripts from Change-O (63). Clustering into clonal groups was also 
carried out using Change-O. Clones were defined as having identical VJ gene usage and junction 
length with a normalised Hamming distance threshold of 0.2, as determined by the distToNearest 
function in the SHazaM R package, used to further partition sequences. Germline sequences for each 
clonal group were reconstructed using CreateGermlines.py from Change-O. The R package Alakazam 
was used for clonal lineage reconstruction, lineage topology and repertoire diversity analysis. 
Mutation counts and frequencies were calculated using a custom Python script, mutation frequency 
was defined as number of mutations divided by length of sequence. The BCR data, including the 
mutational loads and clonal assignments, were then integrated with the processed gene expression 
data in Seurat. Input for the network graphs was generated with custom Python scripts and 
visualised using Gephi (v0.9.7). 
 
Statistics  
Data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test before the appropriate 
parametric or non-parametric test was chosen. All paired and unpaired Student's T-tests, Mann-
Whitney tests, and Spearman correlations for the full-spectrum flow cytometry data were 
performed using Prism 9.4 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Use of the ± following mean values indicates 
the 95% confidence interval.
