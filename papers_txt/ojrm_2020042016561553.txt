1. Introduction 
Scientists are passionate with their visions, taking pride in their work, credit in 
their inventions, and responsibility to human society, all for the betterment of 
mankind. It is in this context that I present this review with the hope that bio-
logical warfare will be banned, and that mankind will unite to combat natural 
pandemics like plague, diphtheria and malaria. 
My generation of baby-boomers was blessed with social/economic prosperity 
and no world war, the number one killer of mankind. However, what we expe-
rienced with COVID-19, H1N1, SARS, H7N1, H7N9, MERS, AIDS and Ebola 
within the last 30 years were terrorizing events with destruction of life, economy, 
relationship, and communication, leaving shadows of anxiety, fear, mistrust and

discrimination for significant years of our relatively short lives. COVID-19’s in-
volvement of the livelihood of 7.7 billion people in 211 countries with an esti-
mate of over 250,000 deaths before it ends is the equivalence of destruction 
second only to a World War. If we do not take haste to manage this human ca-
tastrophe, life in a year will be beyond comprehension. 
As human beings, we need to establish emergency protocols to save lives, and 
to quickly rebuild and sustain social harmony and world economy at times of 
sudden pathogenic attacks. With continual competition in development of bio-
logical warfare weapons, sudden outbreaks, either intentional or unintentional, 
will render certain countries less desirable to be inhabited, even for those who 
had been pre-vaccinated, believing that they might become immunotolerant of 
the viral antigens. We will miss beautiful cultures that we once enjoyed and che-
rished. 
Once There was Peace 
Paleontology recorded that simple lives such as viruses and bacteria were 
original inhabitants of Earth some 3.5 billion years ago. The first mammal ap-
peared 200 million years ago, and the first dinosaur, about 50 million years be-
fore it [1]. These evolutionary ancestors of man (Homo Sapiens) had survived 
bacterial and viral pathogens for 250 million years. Through evolution, they de-
veloped a highly specific and potent immune surveillance system throughout 
their bodies, distributed through the blood circulatory system. 
By the time human beings came to exist some 3 million years ago, our im-
mune system had already evolved to reach and sustain an equilibrium with the 
natural faunas of bacteria and viruses, including those found in the 20-million- 
year-old flying mammalian species of bats [2]. It was not until groups of Ameri-
can virologists and molecular geneticists succeeded in editing viral DNA/cDNA/ 
RNA/m-RNA sequence in late-1990’s that the equilibrium was broken. 
By 1998, a wide variety of viral delivery vehicles for genes had been tested in-
cluding murine retroviruses, recombinant adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated 
virus, HSV, EBV, HIV vectors, and baculovirus. Fusogenic peptides in combina-
tion with liposomes, or polymers, were used to enhance the release of plasmid 
DNA from endosomes. There were techniques to exploit the HIV-1 virus to en-
gineer vectors for gene transfer, the combining of viruses with polymers or ca-
tionic lipids to improve gene transfer, the attachment of nuclear localization 
signal peptides to oligonucleotides to direct them to nuclei, and the invention of 
molecular switch systems allowing genes to be turned on or off at will [3]. 
2. Origin of COVID-19 
2019-nCoV genomics indicated that it was a recombinant virus of SARS-CoV 
and HIV origins. The two species of viruses had distinct and distance pedigrees, 
and because of the different space and time of their existence, their recombinant 
had never appeared in a natural setting [4]. Therefore, 2019-nCoV could not be 
a product of nature, but rather a product of human genetic engineering.

To uncover the scientific origin of the 2019-nCoV, it is necessary to under-
stand certain pertinent scientific reports of gene therapy. Gene therapy encom-
passes interventions that involve deliberate alteration of the genetic material of 
living cells to prevent or to treat diseases [5]. This FDA definition places two 
major technologies into the field of gene therapy: 
1) Conducted in February and published in The Lancet on July 14, 1990 by my 
team, myoblast transfer therapy is the world’s first human gene therapy and so-
matic cell therapy [6]. Through natural cell fusion, which is inherent in myoge-
nesis and muscle regeneration, genetically normal myoblasts inserted their nuc-
lei with full complements of normal genes into hereditary DMD dystrophic 
muscle cells to produce dystrophin, a structural protein that was not produced 
in DMD muscles due to the genetic defect. The transfer of genetic material and 
information occurred in vivo, with the myoblasts serving as the source and the 
vehicle of gene transfer. 
Gina Kolata reported on the front page of the New York Times on Sunday 
June 3, 1990 that “Cell Transplant Found Effective in Muscle Disease: Muscular 
Dystrophy Patient Showed Strength Increase in First Human Test.” William 
French Anderson [7], then the Director of Virology of the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), said that if the finding was confirmed, “This would be a land-
mark.” [8] Dr. Francis Collins, then a gene therapy researcher at the University 
of Michigan in Ann Arbor said the research “is a promising lead….” [8]. He 
recognized that, “there are some real possibilities here…” and both were right 
with the myoblast technology [9]. Peter Gorner reported on the front page of the 
Chicago Tribune on April 6, 1992 that “Tests confirm promise of genetic treat-
ment for dystrophy.” 
2) Single gene transduction 
In September 1990, Anderson transferred the adenosine deaminase (ADA) 
gene into the T cells of a 4-year-old girl with severe combined immunodeficien-
cy (SCID) using a retroviral vector [10]. Although the integrated vector and 
ADA gene expression persisted, the subject had to take regular medication 
throughout the two years of gene treatment. The authors concluded that this 
single gene therapy was safe and effective to treating patients with this very rare 
form of disease [11]. On that basis, NIH’s Anderson claimed to be the first per-
son ever to succeed in gene therapy [12] and became widely acclaimed by 
Americans as the “Father of Gene Therapy” [11] [12]. 
Central to this technology is the use of viruses as vectors to deliver normal 
copies of the faulty or missing gene into a particular cell type of a patient, hoping 
that the therapeutic gene will be expressed to produce a structural or regulatory 
protein, thereby alleviating the disease symptom(s) [13] [14]. 
However, viral vector gene transfer technology has not saved as many lives as 
once expected, but has killed many as I foretold. The viral related death of Jesse 
Gelsinger and participants of other trials in 1999 [15] compelled the FDA to 
re-evaluate gene therapy regulations, thus setting back the development of all

gene therapy programs including mine using no virus but human somatic cells 
called myoblasts. There were numerous deficiencies associated with the use of 
the single gene transduction technology [9]. Much of the hurdles that were 18 
years ago [16] [17] remain unresolved today. 
Grandstands over the Human Genome Project (HGP) [18]-[23] and somatic 
gene therapies [10] [11] [16] [24] [25] [26] in the last three decades fueled en-
thusiasm that most human diseases would eventually be cured with molecular 
medicine [27] [28]. In his position as the Director of the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), and in his “Language of God” [23], Collins not only did not pro-
vide any genetic treatment for COVID-19, he presented “evidence of make- be-
liefs” and misled the world with the natural origin of 2019-nCoV [29]. 
Amidst all the “if’s”, “but’s”, “possibly”, and “almost certainly”, Collins rec-
orded, “So, what is the natural origin of the novel coronavirus responsible for 
the COVID-19 pandemic? The researchers [30] don’t yet have a precise answer.” 
People in Collins’ position were often put in ugly situations of having to give up 
their scientific aptitude and choosing, because of political pressure from their 
immediate employer, the US Congress. I was once at the receiving end, or rather, 
non-receiving end of such malice [31]. 
Collins continued, “Existing computer models predicted that the new corona-
virus would not bind to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as well as the 
SARS virus. However, to their surprise, the researchers found that the spike pro-
tein of the new coronavirus actually bound far better than computer predic-
tions.” After presenting two scenarios of circumstantial evidence of genomic 
modeling, Collins concluded, “Either way, this study leaves little room to refute a 
natural origin for COVID-19.” [29] 
Collins continued, “The researchers [30] went on to analyze genomic data re-
lated to the overall molecular structure, or backbone, of the new coronavirus. 
Their analysis showed that the backbone of the new coronavirus’s genome most 
closely resembles that of a bat coronavirus discovered after the COVID-19 pan-
demic began. However, the region that binds ACE2 resembles a novel virus 
found in pangolins, a strange-looking animal sometimes called a scaly anteater. 
This provides additional evidence that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 
almost certainly originated in nature. If the new coronavirus had been manu-
factured in a lab, scientists most likely would have used the backbones of coro-
naviruses already known to cause serious diseases in humans.” 
Was Collins talking about biological weapon in this last sentence? What kind 
of scientists were Collins referring to who would intentionally cause serious dis-
eases in humans? In his tax-payers’ entrusted position of NIH Director, Collins 
cited a non-committal reference [30] and presented a deliberate falsification of 
published scientific literature of studies described below that were supported by 
at least three Institutes of NIH, to mislead the world that COVID-19 originated 
from a natural course of viral evolution of the Hubei bats. 
I hereby present below the direct, unequivocal evidence that 2019-nCoV is a

biological warfare weapon originally produced in the USA, and that COVID-19 
is a pre-meditated event designed for the USA to consolidate and to sustain po-
litical and economic supremacy internationally. 
In 2008, a group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) isolated from horseshoe bats 
had  their  N  terminus  of  the  spike  protein  (S)  combined  with  a  human 
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)-based pseudovirus system, together with cell 
lines expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules of hu-
man, civet, or horseshoe bat. Ren et al. reported, “in addition to full-length S of 
SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting dif-
ferent sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone.” 
This was a Guided Natural Selection, a process designed to select a lethal, 
transmissible virus by serially infecting cells of an animal model that had ACE2 
receptors similar to human. The chimeric S (spike) covering the receptor-binding 
domain (RBD) gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2 receptor sites. 
The Chinese authors demonstrated that “after replacement of a small segment 
(aa 310 to 518) of Rp3-S by the cognate sequence of BJ01-S, the chimeric spike 
protein mimics the function of BJ01-S in regard to receptor usage in the HIV 
pseudovirus assay system.” That was sufﬁcient to convert the SL-CoV S from 
non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is 
largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function 
[32]. The CoV spike glycoproteins were responsible for cellular receptor recog-
nition [32] [33], cell tropism [34] [35], and host speciﬁcity [36]. 
Ren et al. also reported failure of SARS-CoV S protein to use bat RpACE2 as a 
receptor, suggesting that despite the presence of a diverse group of SL-CoVs in 
horseshoe bats, they were unlikely to be the natural reservoir of the immediate 
progenitor virus for SARS-CoV [32]. That was a non-committal way of saying 
that SARS-CoV did not have a natural origin. 
Hou et al. (2010) [37] extended the above study to ACE2 molecules from sev-
en additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV 
spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection 
assays. Live SARS-CoV infection was carried out with help from Gary Crameri 
and Jennifer Barr, under BioDefense Level 4 (BSL4) conditions at the Australian 
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) [38] [39]. The results, as reported by a group 
of Chinese scientists funded by the Chinese government, showed that “ACE2 of 
Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus from Hubei province supported 
viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency 
in comparison to that of the human ACE2.” Further, “the alteration of several 
key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency” [39]. 
How effective was this genetically engineered construct that was capable of 
transmission cross-species from bat to human, and within the same species from 
human to human? Gain of function (GOF) by which the efficiency of viral 
spreading in human population was engineered and tested in an international 
collaborative study in 2015 as reported by Menachery et al. Using the SARS-CoV

reverse genetics system [40], a chimeric virus was generated and characterized 
expressing  the  spike  of  bat  coronavirus  SHC014  [41]  in  a  mouse-adapted 
SARS-CoV backbone. The University of North Carolina (UNC) collaborative 
study indicated that viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone 
could efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human ACE2, rep-
licate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equiv-
alent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. 
Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrated replication of the chimeric 
virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis [41]. Evaluation of available 
SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor ef-
ficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize 
and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. An infec-
tious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus was synthetically re-derived and it 
demonstrated robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. 
3. Implications of COVID-19 
Menachery et al.’s 2015 [41] publication deserved every attention because it de-
scribed the success of an international collaboration to genetically engineered a 
prototype of 2019-nCoV, confirmed its epidemic destructive capacity, demon-
strated no effective medicament, vaccine, or any therapeutic or prophylactic 
modality, and predicted that COVID-19 would be preeminent. It described, “In 
addition to offering preparation against future emerging viruses, this approach 
must be considered in the context of the US government–mandated pause on 
gain-of-function (GOF) studies.” A moratorium was called to end risky virology 
studies at 14 American institutions, but such effort was in vain [42]. 
Human ingenuity had advanced viral and bat evolution by a million years, 
providing them with the new ability to kill mankind. The combined use of virus 
recombination [32] [33], host switching [32] [33] [34] [35] and GOF [41] were 
achieved. SARS-coronavirus was known for its wide-spread efficiency in popu-
lating the upper respiratory tracks, and genuine HIV plasmid could devastate the 
infected individual’s immune system; and in this case, the target of viral entry is 
ACE2 receptors of human beings. The combined use of the virus recombination 
technology and the host switching technology was already research in the wrong 
direction, upsetting the million-year-old natural equilibrium between human, 
bats and viruses. It was the GOF, a DNA engineering technology that propelled 
the efficiency of transmission among the human population of this monstrous 
chimaera (Figure 1) of SARS-CoV and HIV recombinant to the epidemic and 
pandemic level. 
From the 1998 viral P-shuttle SN Vector to the present clustered regularly in-
terspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing technology, 
SHC014CoV, the prototype of 2019-nCoV, was the prime of viral genetic engi-
neering, and a deadly one. It was biological weapon at its best. It was scientifi-
cally carried out with vision and passion, and the inventors given due credits in

funding and publications for their inventions. However, this invention was to 
benefit no human beings or bats; it would kill them by the millions if left uncon-
trolled. It revolutionized military warfare, killing enemies without deploying 
troops, without demarcating boundary, without war declaration, and usually 
without knowledge or evidence of attack. This invention enabled its owner to kill 
any mammals having human ACE2 receptors. 
The 2015 publication of Menachery et al. alerted a potential pandemic if un-
curbed [41]. In the title of the original article published in Nature Medicine, it 
used the phrase of “pose threat to human emergence”. That was five years before 
COVID-19, in the land of technologic totalism of USA, where two Chinese 
scientists shared their academic advances and were given the middle and the 
second-last placement in the long 15-author list. It was for the American tech-
nology of GOF that they collaborated with UNC. The latter was close to Fort 
Detrick, a key BioDefense Laboratory of the 4th level (BSL4) for biologic weapon 
production and testing. The GOF “turbo-charged” the SARS-CoV/HIV recom-
binant and, for the first time, transformed it to become the world’s most power 
biological weapon of pandemic caliber. This is the origin of the 2019-nCoV. 
Author Contribution of Menarchery et al. recorded, “V.D.M. designed, coor-
dinated and performed experiments, completed analysis and wrote the manu-
script.  B.L.Y.  designed  the  infectious  clone  and  recovered  chimeric  virus-
es…..R.S.B. designed experiments and wrote manuscript.” These were the origi-
nal responsible scientific designers of the biological bomb that left 1,852,021 di-
agnostically infected with COVID-19, and 114,090 dead in 211 countries on 
April 13, 2020, and these numbers are on an exponential up-swing. 
As for “preparation against future emerging viruses” since Menarchery et al’s 
publication five years ago, only one publication has appeared six days ago on 
April 6, 2020 from the same UNC laboratory of Prof. Ralph S. Baric where

2019-nCoV  prototype was  engineered and tested. It documented a vaccine 
which was tested on mice might be a potential treatment for COVID-19. Other-
wise, there has been no documentation of any of the 2019-nCoV transmitting 
bats, if any, were killed to protect human lives. There has not been publication of 
studies documenting inoculation of bats with 2019-nCoV to study if bat-virus 
relationship is symbiotic or parasitic, and how well do the bats immune-tolerate 
these natural or foreign antigens. 
To a business mind, why spent the money to make a man-killing chimeric virus, 
and found a vaccine against it, unless the vaccine could be sold at a good profit. 
However, it is extremely hard if not impossible to develop such vaccine, even by 
the UNC team itself [43]. Due to the tremendous random recombination of the 
chimeric viral RNA with different DNA repertoires from different patients by 
nature, no vaccine can be completely effective in principle, not even manufac-
tured by Baric’s team from UNC for Americans [43]. The only scientifically valid 
vaccine can only be derived from pooled antisera of rehabilitated patients of the 
same blood type [44] [45]. Immediately available therapy for the critically-ill and 
dying patients could only be from serum therapy as previously described [44] 
[45]. One’s own immune system is the number one protection. Failing that, pas-
sive immunogens [44] [45] have to be implemented immediately to save lives. 
The study of Menachery et al. was heavily funded. Its Acknowledgement cited, 
“Research in this manuscript was supported by grants from the National Insti-
tute of Allergy & Infectious Disease and the National Institute of Aging of the 
US National Institutes of Health (NIH) under awards U19AI109761 (R.S.B.),

of statistical approaches and C.T. Tseng (Dept. of Microbiology and Immunolo-

A very unusual and unique statement appeared at the end of the Acknowled-
gement, “Experiments with the full-length and chimeric SHC014 recombinant 
viruses were initiated and performed before the GOF research funding pause 
and have since been reviewed and approved for continued study by the NIH. 
The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily 
represent the official views of the NIH.” These last two sentences constituted a 
NIH disclaimer. What had the sponsors have in mind when they funded this 
project? No scientist would believe that the project was for the benefit of man, 
bat, or virus. 
Coutarda et al. identified a furin-like cleavage site present in 2019-nCoV, 
SARS CoV and in MERS-CoV but absent in CoV of the same clade. “This furin-

like cleavage site, was supposed to be cleaved during virus egress [46] for 
S-protein  “priming”  and  might  provide  a  gain-of-function  (GOF)  to  the 
2019-nCoV for eﬃcient spreading in the human population compared to other 
lineage b betacoronaviruses”.  
“Strikingly, the 2019-nCoV S-protein sequence contains 12 additional nucleo-
tides” [4]. These are the “insertions” of genetic engineering. 
Prof. Francis Boyle of the University of Indiana who drafted the 1989 Biologi-
cal Weapons Act considered Menachery et al.’s SHC014CoV or the 2019-nCoV 
as “an offensive biological warfare agent, and it has no legitimate scientific, or 
medical use  of the Gain-of-Function (GOF) technology” [47]. It was Prof. 
Boyle’s responsibility to oversee biologic warfare in the USA. According to 
Boyle, GOF was a DNA genetic engineering technology of “turbo-charging” 
dangerous biological warfare substances or pathogens. In the Alex Jones Show 
[47], he spoke of 12 warfare bases housing many BSL3/BSL4 laboratories specia-
lized in system engineering of biological warfare weapons in the USA, and the 
BSL3/BSL4 warfare laboratories of Fort Detrick in Maryland was one of them. 
According to the news report, Fort Detrick had its license revoked last July after 
an outbreak similar to COVID-19, killing about 20,000 people with 75% of 
nearby citizens infected. He said he had condemned Fort Detrick and the UNC 
for  violating  the  1989  Biological  Weapons  Act  that  he  drafted,  for  “tur-
bo-charging” every pathogen including SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV that he 
proclaimed were bioweapons from Fort Detrick. He insisted that Fort Detrick 
should be shut down and their investigators be fully investigated. 
In the name of academic pursuit and human health, various Institute Direc-
tors of NIH, beginning with French Anderson of the Institute of Virology unto 
the NIH Director Francis Collins, used American tax-payers’ money to fund 
studies to manufacture and test viruses that no others bore a closer resemblance 
to 2019-nCoV, at least five years ago. For all that “preparation against future 
emerging viruses”, NIH had not developed any safe and effective treatment. 
When concerned scientists called moratorium to end U.S. Government man-
dated pause on GOF projects, NIH Directors unloaded their responsibilities with 
a disclaimer and funded these man-killing projects with American tax-payers’ 
money. Is this Liberty and Justice for All? 
FDA scientist was an author in this man-killing project of Menachery et al. 
Crime against humanity had been FDA’s specialty [48] [49] [50]. Inside the 
ivory tower of FDA inhabited many corruptive bureaucrats who would act or 
not act according to directions. After forcing me out of the USA as a foreign 
leading scientist holding key patents on myoblast transplantation technology, 
FDA has listed 23 projects in Phase II/III clinical trial, with more listed under 
muscle stem cells. EMA also listed 6 projects of myoblast transplantation. This 
latter platform technology had produced safe and effective therapies for muscu-
lar dystrophies, cardiomyopathies, Type-II diabetes, solid tumor and aging ac-
counting for 80% of human death discounting war and pandemic deaths [51].

In December, 2019, USA refused to sign a new international protocol to ban 
biological warfare. USA has developed the best of biological warfare weapons 
and has set up 200 BioDefense laboratories around the world. USA has been the 
only country that refused WHO inspection of its biological warfare laboratories. 
When CDC suspended the BSL3/4 license from Fort Detrick last July, and de-
manded close-down of its facility and destruction of its records, many of its 
workers had already been contaminated, ending in COVID-19 outbreak in the 
East Coast cities. As of April 13, 2020, COVID-19 is on an exponential up-swing 
in USA, causing 22,090 deaths and 560,055 accumulatively diagnosed patients 
within the last four weeks. Vaccination had not been completely effective, espe-
cially for elderly patients with underlying illnesses. 
It took some ruthless, law-unbinding, and power-hungry men who wanted to 
take lives of their fellow men to boost the political and economic supremacy of 
their own, less their country. They developed, owned, and used the products of 
the three jointly applied technologies described above. It took someone who was 
already rich and in power, who could convince the U.S. Congress to exert pres-
sure onto NIH Director and Directors to fund this and previous man-killing 
projects, to the extent that NIH had to issue disclaimer statements for its own 
protection. 
On March 17, 2020, U. S. President Donald Trump began to proclaime 
2019-nCoV as “Chinese virus” on world news, to mislead the world and setting 
the pace for China to pay for COVID-19 world damages. Most people believed 
President Trump’s version on international television; his telling of Chinese vi-
rus jumped onto human from eating bats in a broth. Those with higher intelli-
gence preferred the more exotic bat sashimi, arguing that the 2019-nCoV could 
not have survived 86˚C, less boiling at 100˚C in the broth.  
On March 25, at the recommendation of President Trump, 54% of the Repub-
lican and 36% of the Democratic members of the U.S. Congress voted to de-
mand China to pay for at least part of the damages, with 42% of the American 
voters’ support, 28% willing to go to war without hesitation if China refused to 
pay. 
On March 29, American news announced that China was the first country to 
have COVID-19. The U. S. government had threatened not to repay all or por-
tion of the U.S. debts borrowed from China, amounting to one thousand billion 
U.S. dollars, for punishing the Chinese government’s delay in the control of 
COVID-19 spreading from bat-eating in the Hua Nan Seafood Market in Wu-
han. Strangely enough, it had completely avoided talks of biological warfare, but 
insisted on condemnation news of Chinese viruses from Wuhan bats. 
Recent poll announced that 68% of the American voters, mostly misled, was 
in  support  of  this  action.  Without  fully  understanding  the  true  origins  of 
2019-nCoV and COVID-19, many innocent Americans may be misled to go to 
war and die for a wrong cause. There is no reason for China to pay one thousand 
billion U.S. dollars to admit a crime which China did not commit. In the sixties

of the last century, many young Americans took anti-war actions and refused to 
fight the Viet Nam War. 
It is the goal of this review to warn against and to correct international mi-
sunderstanding created by deliberate falsification of scientific documentations 
and events. This misunderstanding may lead to war and further destruction of 
life, economy, and political relations. People should not be blind-sighted when 
making life decisions. It is my social responsibility, as a scientist, to inform the 
world of the scientific origins of 2019-nCoV and COVID-19. It is time for scien-
tists to form alliance to speak up and to protect everything that belongs to hu-
man society. Left unchecked, COVID-19 will leave us with death, destruction, 
and grief, only second to the last world war. 
Since December 12, 2019, 2019-nCoV has affected 211 countries and the live-
lihood of 7.7 billion people. As of April 13, 2020, 1,852,021 people have been di-
agnosed infected. COVID-19 has only been active for 4 months, and has already 
killed 114,090 people. If allowed to propagate, it could easily kill 250,000 people 
in a year. 
COVID-19 was basically contained by March 18, 2020 in China with no new 
case reported until imported cases. It took a strong leadership, a great govern-
ment, good directions of the medical experts, solidarity and discipline of the 
Chinese people, and sacrifice of the medical professionals all working together to 
achieve such a result. China has set examples of treatment and has helped dif-
ferent men of the world to fight our true enemy, the 2019-nCoV. Let us join 
hands doing just that. 
There was no declaration of war, no gunfire or explosives. There was no 
country boundary to fight over. The enemy could not be seen. Human beings 
were fearful of the viral presence. It had taken away our freedom to travel, make 
friends, and explore opportunities of all sorts on the Belt Road and around the 
world. 2019-nCoV left husband and wife to become killing partners, and res-
pectable elderly dead alone without attendance. So much time, efforts and re-
sources spent on constructing the friendly world connection of Belt Road for 
mankind were wasted and the project de-railed. 
Could we ever go back to the peaceful time that we once had when we could 
breathe the air of freedom, and enjoy the beauties around us? People of all races, 
colors, religions, ages, sexes, sizes have suffered, and will continue to suffer until 
we stop funding, designing, manufacturing, facilitating and using biological 
warfare weapons such as 2019-nCoV, H1N1, SARS, H7N1, H7N9, MERS, HIV 
and Ebola. These were pre-meditated, cold blood murders. 
Long before the 2019 outbreak of COVD-19 in the USA, Coronavirus of 
Clades  A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E  had  already  been  in  the  records  of  American 
BSL3/BSL4 laboratories. The betacoronavirus of 2019-nCoV belongs to the C 
Clade. Despite all the bat species in Hubei, only the C Clade has been identified 
in China. There was no evidence of grand-parents (clade A), parents (clade B), 
children (clade D) or grand-children (clade E) of the 2019-CoV in China. This

provided circumstantial evidence that COVID-19 in Wuhan might have derived 
from viruses overseas and not from China. 
It is extraordinary that Britain, as one of the key entry ports into Europe, was 
relatively spared by COVID-19 as compared to Italy, the first country to sign-up 
with the Belt Road. It is extraordinary that Britain left the EU at the fortnight of 
COVD-19 outbreak in Europe, and its Prime Minister announced that British 
should not fear and could go on living as usual because they were healthy as if 
“immunized”. This was similar to President Trump’s announcement to the 
American public at the onset of COVID-19 in the USA. In North America, citi-
zens received free annual Flu shots. Last fall, all 60-year-olds and above were 
given an extra “shot” against pneumonia. 
4. Treatment of COVID-19 
I had previously published the emergent serum therapy and antibody medicine 
to counteract sudden attacks of COVID-19 and other pathogenic epidemics [44] 
[45]. This is to provide background development leading to such. 
Regulatory and Compassionate Drug Usage 
Mono-antibodies  produced  against  the  primary  structures  of  the  viral 
DNA/RNA/mRNA demonstrated efficacy in viraemia reduction [52] [53], but 
clinical trials of CR3022 with CR3014 had never been tried due to the high cost 
of manufacturing [54] [55]. There were antiviral drugs designed to block viral 
replication.  Ribavirin,  lopinavir/ritonavir  and  corticosteroids  had  lowered 
21-day ARDS and mortality than those who received ribavirin and corticostero-
ids together [56] [57]. 
Corticosteroids were not recommended by WHO [58] [59]. Corticosteroids 
caused local and systemic immunosuppression. Their administration had been 
associated with higher plasma viral load, slower viral clearance and higher mor-
tality in both SARS and H1N1 [60]. Chloroquine was found to be a potent inhi-
bitor of SARS coronavirus infection through interfering with ACE2, one of cell 
surface binding sites for S protein of SARS-CoV [61]. It would be useful in our 
combat against COVID-19, especially with early infection of mild cases. There 
were no clinical data on the efficacy of fusion inhibitors to prevent viral entry in 
SARS, MERS or COVID-19. 
The diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified recently appeared to 
be promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for the 
2019-nCoV [62]. The safety and efficacy of Remdesivir usage is doubtful for lack 
of statistics [63]. 
Without a compassionate use approval from the FDA/EMA/CFDA, drug dis-
coveries had never been timely enough to gain regulatory approval to save lives, 
and may never will in a safe and efficacious manner. 
Evolutionary Antidote 
It is not only scientifically valid but also logical to deem convalescent serum 
therapy be the treatment of choice because the antiserum contains the antiviral

antibodies IgG and IgG fragments that had won over the viral primary and mu-
tated antigens to allow the patients to be rehabilitated [44] [45]. We do not have 
any other immunotherapy or medicament with virus-specific antibodies that 
works on the same mechanism and principle. Beating bacterial or viral infections 
can give “acquired immunity” where the immune system recognizes the infec-
tious agent the next time it is encountered. This is done by antibodies that label 
or neutralize the infectious agent. 
I could not have emphasized more that although the antiviral antibodies were 
contained in the lymph, serum, plasma and whole blood of the rehabilitated 
subject, transfusion of each component delivered different consequences for 
what each contained. A formal evaluation [44] [45] and a systematic review and 
exploratory meta-analysis [64] argued against the contention that the use of 
convalescent plasma as a treatment could be without the occurrence of severe 
adverse events [65]. Without properly-designed control studies, many patients 
who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ 
failure were counted as died of natural course of the diseases rather than serious 
adverse reactions triggered by non-scientific use of convalescent plasmas [66]. 
Historic Development 
In Medieval times, death was often associated with blood loss, and blood 
transfusion for revitalizing wounded soldiers became a norm to save lives in the 
battle field. Without the knowledge of ABO-blood type matching, or how to 
control infections, most of these blood recipients died with few exceptions. 
With the discovery of microscopy in 1665, scientists could distinguish various 
cell types including the non-nucleated platelets. However, there were still ques-
tion as to whether a dying man should have the whole blood of the donor, or the 
latter’s plasma, or serum alone. 
Serum therapies have been around since the late 1800’s. In fact, the 1901 No-
bel Prize was awarded to Emil von Behring for his pioneering work on them. Dr. 
von Behring is responsible for beating a diphtheria epidemic in Germany with 
the use of equine serum therapy. With the little equipment he had at the time, it 
was a tremendous triumph on his part for using ice to get clotted serum for his 
patients. Dr. von Behring opened up the field of immunology that has allowed 
scientists and physicians alike to understand pathogenesis and treatment of nu-
merous diseases. 
Discovery of ABO-blood typing was a very significant period during which 
mortality and morbidity were significantly reduced through blood transfusion. It 
is during this period that serum therapies became convalescent plasma therapies. 
It might be related to the rapid development of antibiotics and steroids. The lat-
ter development produced very lucrative profits that neither serum therapy nor 
convalescent plasma could match. Medical devices eventually were developed to 
provide plasma, especially platelet-rich-plasma (PRP), for battlefield usage in 
wound healing. 
Convalescent Plasma against Epidemics

COVID-19 refers to the outbreak of pneumonia pandemic induced by the se-
vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 
2019-nCoV. Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins had been used as a last 
resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition con-
tinued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. More-
over, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in pa-
tients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with 
convalescent plasma [66] [67] [68] [69]. In 2014, the use of convalescent plasma 
collected from patients who had recovered from Ebola virus disease was recom-
mended by WHO as an empirical treatment during outbreaks [70] [71]. A pro-
tocol for the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of Middle East respira-
tory syndrome coronavirus was established in 2015 [72] [73]. In terms of pa-
tients with pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus infection, a 
prospective cohort study by Hung and colleagues showed a significant reduction 
in the relative risk of mortality (odds ratio 0·20 [95% CI 0·06 - 0·69], p = 0.01) 
for patients treated with convalescent plasma [74]. Additionally, in a subgroup 
analysis, viral load after convalescent plasma treatment was significantly lower 
on days 3, 5, and 7 after intensive care unit admission. No adverse events were 
observed. A multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial 
by Hung and colleagues showed that using convalescent plasma from patients 
who recovered from the influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infection to treat pa-
tients with severe influenza A H1N1 infection was associated with a lower viral 
load and reduced mortality within 5 days of symptom onset [75]. 
Most of the treatment options for MERS were extrapolated from the 2003 out-
break of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 
2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak [76]. Like SARS-CoV, COVID-19 CoV binded to 
ACE-2 receptors and could also infect and replicate in macrophages, potentially 
leading to ARDS and death of the patients [66]. A meta-analysis by Mair-Jenkins 
and colleagues showed that the mortality was reduced in early-diagnosed pa-
tients with severe acute respiratory infections after receiving convalescent plas-
ma, with no adverse events or complications after treatment [64]. 
Convalescent plasma is a form of passive immunotherapy. It was usually cho-
sen when there were no specific vaccines or drugs available for emerging infec-
tion‐related diseases [77] Arabi et al had tested the feasibility of convalescent 
plasma therapy as well as its safety and clinical efficacy in critically-ill MERS pa-
tients. They found that convalescent plasma had an immunotherapeutic poten-
tial for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection [72]. In addition, convalescent 
plasma from recovered SARS patients had also been reported to be useful clini-
cally for treating other SARS patients [68] [69]. The use of convalescent plasma 
or serum was suggested by the WHO under Blood Regulators Network when 
vaccines and antiviral drugs were unavailable for an emerging virus. Convales-
cent plasma has been routinely used for the treatment of COVID-19 infected 
critically-ill patients in China [78].

Even as of today, biopharmaceutics and scientists continued making the same 
mistakes by using convalescent plasma without applying the precision technol-
ogy of antigen-antibody specificity of convalescent serum therapy [79]. Some are 
repeating what they were taught; others refer to plasma and serum as if they are 
the same [79]. Very few are aware of the difference that they have caused be-
tween death or life for the critically-ill or dying patients. Although WHO rec-
ommended convalescent plasma to be used as an empirical treatment for Ebola 
in 2014 [71], it has not recommended the same for COVID-19 because of lack of 
evidence of safety and efficacy as of April 13, 2020, 2020 [59]. 
Convalescent Serum against Pandemics 
Let us revisit the ingenuity of Emil Adolph von Behring, the Father of Immu-
nology. During the poliomyelitis epidemic in 1917, Amoss and Chesney demon-
strated that convalescent serum, when injected both intra-spinally and intrave-
nously, significantly reduced paralysis, mortality rate, symptom severity, and 
hospital stay of critically-ill patients [80]. The earlier in the course of the disease 
the serum was employed in suitable doses, the more promise there was of bene-
fit. The decision to employ the serum should rest upon a clinical examination 
supported by the results of the microscopic and chemical study of the cerebros-
pinal fluid. Reinjection 12 to 24 hours later may be advantageous; the tempera-
ture curve served to indicate the time for reinjection. 
Meta-analysis by Luke and colleagues identified eight studies involving 1703 
patients with 1918 influenza pneumonia from 1918 to 1925 who received an in-
fusion of influenza-convalescent human blood products, which showed a pooled 
absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI 15 - 27; p < 0.001) in the overall crude case 
fatality rate at low risk of bias [81]. 
The use of convalescent human serum in treating 37 influenza pneumonia pa-
tients in 1918 demonstrated that thirty were rehabilitated; six were continuing 
treatment; one had died; all but one of these had a favorable outlook [82]. Blood 
to the amount of about 800 cc. was taken from each donor, under sterile precau-
tions; 400 cc. at a time on two successive days. Thus, each donor yielded about 
300 cc. of serum. The blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for about 
an hour, then plate cultures were made, and the containers placed on ice. over 
night. The separated serum was cleared by centrifugalizing at high speed; then 
bottled, and in most cases given the same day. 
Attempt was made to test the potency of the serum of the donors in the old 
days by complement fixation and by gross agglutination, using isolated influenza 
bacillus as an antigen. However, without PCR technology to assess the antibody 
content of the serum, efficacy can only be determined by its clinical action on 
recipients [83]. 
Serum therapies were successfully used to treat many  infectious diseases 
(anthrax, plague, scarlet fever, measles, tularemia, diphtheria, dysentery, me-
ningococcal meningitis, rabies, pneumococcal pneumonia) for half a century af-
ter Dr. Emil von Behring first demonstrated their effective use as a therapeutic in

diphtheria. Their general use fell into disfavor after the advent of antibiotic 
therapies and in consideration of the problems of adverse reactions to animal 
derived sera and whole serum. However, human and animal derived immunog-
lobulins remain important therapies for a variety of conditions (parvovirus, 
CMV, hepatitis B, rabies, hepatitis A, botulism, envenoming, etc.) 
The WHO deemed convalescent plasma as the most promising near-term 
therapy for MERS in the WHO—International Severe Acute Respiratory and 
Emerging Infection Consortium MERS-CoV Outbreak  Readiness  Workshop 
2013 [83]. However, due to the lack of clinical trials, a WHO position paper 
published in March 2014 stated that the clinical use of convalescent plasma 
should be regarded as investigation WHO had issued a Position Paper on the 
collection and use of convalescent plasma or serum in emergent experimental 
therapies to treat MERS. This should be followed as guidelines to treating 
COVID-19. 
From Here to Recovery 
What do we do to prevent life from here to eternality? 
1) Stop depositing biological bombs. Over a hundred thousand people have 
already been killed by 2019-nCoV. 
2) Stop any scientific development toward biological warfare, especially fund-
ing. Set up surveillance systems to destroy and ban biological warfare weapons. 
3) Implement serum therapy and research for vaccine in the correct way [44] 
[45] with haste and precision. Everyday counts; watch the death toll board. 
4) Focus on and fund biomedical research and development. There will be no 
quality of life if we acquire fatal and debilitating diseases, and nothing matters if 
we are dead. Dead by 2019-nCoV is extremely painful. 
5. Conclusion 
These are COVID-19’s treatment, origin and implications; the good, the bad, 
and the ugly. Gina Kolata or others may use this platform for me to discuss gene 
therapies with William French Anderson and Francis Collins 30 years after we 
created and established this very important field of biomedicine.
