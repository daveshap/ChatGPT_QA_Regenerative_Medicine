Abstract 
Interspecies chimera formation with human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) holds great promise to 
generate  humanized  animal  models  and  provide  donor  organs  for  transplant.  However,  the 
approach is currently limited by low levels of human cells ultimately represented in chimeric 
embryos. Different strategies have been developed to improve chimerism by genetically editing 
donor human PSCs. To date, however, it remains unexplored if human chimerism can be enhanced 
in animals through modifying the host embryos. Leveraging the interspecies PSC competition 
model, here we discovered retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling, 
an RNA sensor, in “winner” cells plays an important role in the competitive interactions between 
co-cultured mouse and human PSCs. We found that genetic inactivation of Ddx58/Ifih1-Mavs-Irf7 
axis compromised the “winner” status of mouse PSCs and their ability to outcompete PSCs from 
evolutionarily distant species during co-culture. Furthermore, by using Mavs-deficient mouse 
embryos  we  substantially  improved  unmodified  donor  human  cell  survival.  Comparative 
transcriptome analyses based on species-specific sequences suggest contact-dependent human-to-
mouse transfer of RNAs likely plays a part in mediating the cross-species interactions. Taken 
together, these findings establish a previously unrecognized role of RNA sensing and innate 
immunity in “winner” cells during cell competition and provides a proof-of-concept for modifying 
host embryos, rather than donor PSCs, to enhance interspecies chimerism. 
 
Main text 
The technique of generating interspecies chimeras using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is 
a promising in vivo platform to study human development and offers a potential source for growing 
human donor organs in animals1,2. Although robust chimerism can be achieved between closely 
related species3,4, it is far more difficult to generate chimeras between evolutionarily distant 
species5. The low chimerism of human cells in animals (e.g., mice and pigs) is presumably due to 
multiple xenogeneic barriers during early development, which include but are not limited to 
differences in developmental pace, incompatibility in cell adhesion molecules, and interspecies 
cell competition. Several strategies have been developed to improve human cell chimerism in 
animal embryos by genetically inhibiting human cell apoptosis6-10. However, these strategies are 
not practical for future use in regenerative medicine as the modified genes and pathways are mostly 
oncogenic. Improving survival and chimerism of unmodified donor hPSCs through editing the 
host embryos will be a preferred solution but has not been explored.  
 
We previously developed an interspecies PSC co-culture system and discovered a competitive 
interaction between primed but not naïve human and mouse PSCs, whereby loser hPSCs are 
eliminated by winner mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) through apoptosis. Genetic inactivation 
of MyD88, P65 or P53 in hPSCs could overcome human-mouse PSC competition, thereby 
improving human cell survival and chimerism in early mouse embryos10. In contrast to loser hPSCs, 
however, little is known regarding what enacts the winner status of mEpiSCs. To this end, we 
performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of separately cultured and co-cultured mEpiSCs. H9

human embryonic stem (ES) cells and mEpiSCs were labeled with enhanced green fluorescent 
protein (eGFP) and monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO), respectively. We isolated mEpiSCs from 
day 1-3 co-cultures and separated cultures by fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS) 
for RNA-seq (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 
422, 301 and 77 upregulated genes on days 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in co-cultured versus separately 
cultured mEpiSCs (co-culture upregulated genes, or co-URGs) (Fig. 1b). Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG)  pathway  analyses  were  performed  using  these  co-URGs. 
Interestingly, many overrepresented pathways in days 1 and 2 co-URG groups were related to 
virus infection and innate immunity (Extended Data Fig. 1a-c, Supplementary Table 1). Among 
them, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway represents one 
of the major RNA sensing systems in mammalian cells, which can be activated by viral and host-
derived RNAs11,12. RLR activation results in the transcriptional induction of type I interferons that 
mounts an antiviral host response13. RLR signaling participates in the maintenance of homeostatic 
genetic stability of cell populations and self-protection11,14. Several key component genes of the 
RLR pathway were significantly upregulated in days 1-2 co-cultured versus separately cultured 
mEpiSCs, including the cytoplasmic RNA sensors Ddx58 (RIG-I)15 and Ifih1 (MDA5)16,17 and the 
downstream transcription factor Irf718 (Fig. 1c, d, Extended Data Fig. 1d-f).    
Next, we determined whether the RLR pathway is intact in mEpiSCs. To this end, we transfected 
mEpiSCs with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (also known as poly (I:C)), a double-stranded RNA 
analogue that can activate RLRs19,20. Native gel electrophoresis and western blotting revealed IRF3 
dimerization, demonstrating an activated RLR signaling in poly (I:C) transfected mEpiSCs (Fig. 
1e). To confirm RLR pathway activation in mEpiSCs co-cultured with H9 hES cells, FACS-
isolated mEpiSCs from day 2 co-culture and separate culture were subjected to protein extraction 
and native gel electrophoresis. Consistent with RNA-seq results, we found RLR pathway was 
activated as evidenced by IRF3 dimerization in co-cultured but not separately cultured mEpiSCs 
(Fig. 1e). RLR pathway activation in co-cultured mEpiSCs seems to be contact-dependent as we 
did not observe upregulation of RLR-pathway-related genes in mEpiSCs co-cultured with H9 hES 
cells in trans-wells (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Interestingly, when P65KO-hiPSCs were used for co-
culture, upregulated expression of RLR-pathway-related genes were still observed in mEpiSCs 
(Extended Data Fig. 1h, i), demonstrating RLR signaling activation in mEpiSCs is independent 
of the outcomes of hPSCs during co-culture. In contrast to mEpiSCs, there was no apparent 
activation of the RLR signaling pathway in co-cultured H9 hES cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a-i, 
Supplementary Table 2). Collectively, during co-culture with loser hPSCs, our results uncovered 
an intriguing cell contact-dependent activation of RLRs in winner mEpiSCs.   
 
Mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (MAVS) is the central hub for RLR sensors and 
downstream signaling18,21-23. To determine whether RLR signaling contributes to human-mouse 
PSC competition, we knocked out Mavs in mEpiSCs (MavsKO mEpiSCs) and confirmed Mavs 
deficiency  did  not  affect  self-renewal,  proliferation  and  expression  of  key  pluripotency 
transcription factors (Extended Data Fig. 3a-c). IRF3 dimerization signal was lost in day 2 co-

cultured MavsKO mEpiSCs (Fig. 1e) and most RLR-pathway-related genes were expressed at 
comparable levels to separate cultures (Fig. 1f), demonstrating Mavs knockout is effective in 
blocking RLR signaling in co-cultured mEpiSCs. Time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed better 
survival of H9 hES cells during co-culture with MavsKO mEpiSCs than with WT mEpiSCs 
(Supplementary Video 1). Next, we calculated the cell densities (cell number per cm2) of live H9 
hES cells and mEpiSCs in co-culture and separate culture daily until they grew to confluency (days 
1-5). A more rapid elimination of H9 hES cells was observed during co-culture with WT than with 
MavsKO mEpiSCs (Fig. 2a). These results suggest compromised competitiveness of MavsKO 
mEpiSCs. We also tested higher cell plating densities. Notably, on day 3, significantly more H9 
hES cells were found in co-cultures with MavsKO than with WT mEpiSCs (Fig. 2b, Extended 
Data Fig. 3d). To confirm this finding with an independent method, we performed automatic cell 
recognition and unbiased counting by using an image analysis software. To this end, eGFP-H2B 
labeled WT or MavsKO mEpiSCs and/or mScarlet-H2B labeled H9 hES cells were plated in 
micropatterned plates. Fluorescence images were recorded over time for each micropatterned 
colony using confocal microscopy followed by image analysis and automated cell counting (see 
Methods). In consistent, on day 3, significantly higher numbers of live H9 hES cells were present 
in co-cultures with MavsKO than with WT mEpiSCs (Extended Data Fig. 3e, f).   
 
Interestingly, during co-culture with H9 hES cells, more MavsKO mEpiSCs appeared to undergo 
cell death than WT mEpiSCs (Supplementary Video 1). In addition, starting from day 4, in 
contrast to WT mEpiSCs, significantly lower densities of MavsKO mEpiSCs were found in co-
cultures than separate cultures (Fig. 2a). These results suggest reduced viability of MavsKO 
mEpiSCs during co-culture with H9 hES cells. In addition to Mavs, we individually knocked out 
genes upstream (Ddx58, Ifih1) and downstream (Irf7) of Mavs in the RLR pathway in mEpiSCs. 
Ddx58KO-, Ifih1KO- and Irf7KO-mEpiSCs all could be passaged long term in culture and maintained 
the expression of OCT4 and SOX2 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Similar to Mavs, deficiency of 
Ddx58, Ifih1 and Irf7 also led to the significant reduction in mEpiSC densities during co-cultures 
with H9 hES cells (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4c). Together, these results reveal that both cell 
competitiveness and viability were compromised in winner mEpiSCs by depleting Mavs, and 
demonstrate the important role of RLR pathway in human-mouse PSC competition.    
 
In addition to human cells, mEpiSCs could outcompete rhesus macaque and bovine ES cells during 
co-cultures10. Next, we studied whether RLR signaling was involved in PSC competition between 
mouse and other species. We co-cultured WT and MavsKO mEpiSCs with rhesus (ORMES23) and 
bovine ES cells, respectively. On days 4-5, there were evidently more rhesus and bovine ES cells 
remained in co-cultures with MavsKO than with WT mEpiSCs, while significantly less MavsKO 
mEpiSCs were found in co-cultures than WT mEpiSCs (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5a-c, 
Supplementary Video 2). These findings demonstrate that, in the presence of rhesus and bovine 
ES cells, Mavs deficiency also diminished the competitiveness and fitness of mEpiSCs. When 
compared with separately cultured mEpiSCs, many RLR-pathway-related genes were upregulated

in days 1-3 mEpiSCs co-cultured with bovine ES cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d), consistent with 
what we found in human-mouse PSC co-cultures. Collectively, these results suggest conserved 
roles of RLR signaling during competitive interactions of mEpiSCs with primed PSCs from other 
species.  
 
To determine whether the suppression of RLR signaling in host mouse embryos could improve 
donor hPSC survival, we microinjected the same number (10) of eGFP labeled hiPSCs into WT 
and Mavs-/- mouse24 blastocysts followed by ex vivo culture25 (Fig. 3a). After 3 and 5 days, eGFP 
signals were detected in most Mavs-/- embryos injected with hiPSCs, whereas fewer WT embryos 
contained eGFP+ human cells (Fig. 3b, c). To study human cell survival in Mavs-deficient mouse 
embryos in vivo, we electroporated WT mouse embryos with Cas9 protein and Mavs targeting 
sgRNAs at zygote stage, microinjected eGFP+ hiPSCs to the blastocysts and then performed 
embryo transfer (Fig. 3a). We found the percentages of embryonic day (E) 8.5-9.5 mouse embryos 
containing eGFP+ signals were 18.75% (6 out of 32) for Mavs-/-, but only 5.26% (1 out of 19) for 
Mavs+/- and 0% (0 out of 9) for Mavs+/+ (Fig. 3d). The presence of human cells in E8.5-9.5 Mavs-
/- embryos was validated by immunostaining of eGFP (Fig. 3e) and genomic PCR using human-
specific Al     u (TPA25-Alu) primers26 (Fig. 3f). Together, these results demonstrate genetic 
inactivation of RLR signaling in the host could improve unmodified donor human cell survival in 
early mouse embryos. 
 
Horizontal RNA transfer mediated by exosomes, free extracellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 
particles, or tunneling nanotubes has been observed in mammals27-30. We speculated that the 
observed RLR signaling pathway activation in mEpiSCs during co-culture with hPSCs was likely 
caused by interspecies (human-to-mouse) horizontal RNA transfer. To look for evidence, we 
revisited our RNA-seq (bulk) data, which was generated from FACS-sorted cells based on 
fluorescence (human, eGFP10; mouse, mKO) to minimize cross-species contamination (Fig. 1a). 
To find out whether human RNAs are present in mEpiSCs, we first identified mouse- and human-
specific reads, and used only these species-specific reads to calculate human genome mapping 
rates for each sequenced sample (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, we detected a small proportion of human-
specific reads in co-cultured mEpiSCs (0.57%, 1.30% and 0.33%, for day 1, day 2, and day 3, 
respectively), which was most prominent on day 2 and consistent with our finding on RLR 
signaling activation (Fig. 4b, 1b, 1c). Similar results were obtained from mEpiSCs co-cultured 
with P65KO-hiPSCs (Extended Data Fig. 6c). We also performed the same analysis using RNA-
seq  data  generated  from  non-contact  (transwell)  co-cultures  (Extended  Data  Fig.  6d). 
Interestingly, human-specific reads were barely detectable in both transwell co-cultured (0.05%) 
or separately cultured mEpiSCs (0.03%) (Fig. 4b(cid:0). Together, these results reveal the presence of 
human transcripts in  co-cultured mEpiSCs, and suggest putative horizontal RNA transfer through 
physical connections (e.g., membrane nanotubes(cid:0)28(cid:0)(cid:0) (e.g., extracellular vesicles(cid:0)27.

We then determined the abundance of human transcripts in co-cultured mEpiSCs and found it was 
positively correlated with gene expression levels in separately cultured H9 hES cells (Fig. 4c). 
Stress-induced transcription of retrotransposable elements (REs) has recently been recognized to 
play an important role in RNA immune response31-34. Therefore, we interrogated multi-mapped 
reads in these RNA-seq datasets using pipelines designed35. Intriguingly, we detected the presence 
of human RNAs coding for both young and ancient retroelements in mouse EpiSCs, which was 
contact-dependent and correlated with abundance and peaked at day 2 (Extended Data Fig. 7a, 
b). Of note is that the expression levels of human retroelements in H9 hES cells were not affected 
by culture conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7c-f). Therefore, retroelement RNAs may contribute 
to RLR signaling activation in mouse cells.  In addition, the non-functional exogenous eGFP 
sequences could also be detected in mEpiSCs specifically under co-cultured condition (Extended 
Data Fig. 6e), providing further evidence that the putative interspecies horizontal RNA transfer 
process is random instead of selectively active transport.   
   
To rule out the possibility that the co-cultured mEpiSCs collected by FACS was contaminated 
with small amounts of human cells, we performed single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), using 
mEpiSCs isolated from day 2 co-culture and separate culture. After filtering out cells with low 
quality, we obtained transcriptome datasets from 16,225 cells including 6,969 and 9,256 cells in 
separate and co-cultured conditions, respectively (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8a). We performed 
unsupervised clustering and identified 9 clusters (Fig. 4d). We observed significant differences in 
cell  composition  between  separate  and  co-cultures:  C2,  C3  and  C6  clusters  predominantly 
consisted of co-cultured cells, whereas C1 and C4 clusters were mainly from cells in separate 
culture (Fig. 4e). To account for possible cell fusion or doublet generated in scRNA-seq library 
preparation process, as a control, we included “cross-species doublets” identified by multi-genome 
analysis  by  Cell  Ranger.  Consistent  with  bulk  RNA-seq,  scRNA-seq  data  also  revealed 
significantly elevated mapping rates (~1.2%) to the human genome in co-cultured mEpiSCs, which 
was significantly higher than in separately cultured mEpiSCs (~0.1%) and much lower than “cross-
species doublet” (~40.2%) (Fig. 4f). UMAP visualization revealed that the presence of human 
RNAs could be detected in many co-cultured mEpiSCs (Fig. 4g). In addition, eGFP transcripts 
from human cells were significantly increased in co-cultured versus separately cultured mEpiSCs, 
which was also significantly lower than those in “cross-species doublet” (Extended Data Fig. 8b-
d). Next, based on the scRNA-seq data, we performed expression correlation analysis of human 
transcripts, and found high Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between co-cultured mEpiSCs 
and H9 hES cells, especially, genes with higher expression level in H9 hES cells are more likely 
to be detected in co-cultured mEpiSCs (Extended Data Fig. 8e). These results confirmed the 
presence of human RNA in co-cultured mEpiSCs at single cell level and further suggest that the 
putative human-to-mouse RNA transfer is non-selective.  
 
In summary, we discovered RLR signaling pathway was activated in mEpiSCs during interspecies 
primed PSC competition. Genetic perturbation of key players in the RLR signaling pathway

compromised the “winner” status of mEpiSCs, and thereby resulting in better survival of “loser” 
PSCs from evolutionarily distant species, including humans, rhesus monkeys and cattle. We 
further showed that by using Mavs-deficient mouse embryos as hosts, survival of unmodified 
donor hPSCs could be improved. In addition, we detected the presence of human transcripts 
encoding unique genes and retrotransposable elements in co-cultured mEpiSCs, putatively as a 
result a non-selective and contact dependent human-to-mouse RNA transfer. Future studies are 
warrantied to dissect the detailed molecular mechanisms and functional consequences underlying 
this horizontal RNA transfer between PSCs from different species.  
 
Our study uncovers an unexpected and intriguing role of RNA innate immunity in interspecies 
PSC competition and chimerism, and it’ll be interesting to determine whether the same mechanism 
also operates in “winner” cells in classical cell competition models such as Minute mutant36 and 
dMyc37. By suppressing the RLR pathway in mouse embryos, we demonstrate the feasibility of 
modifying  the  host  embryos  to  boost  interspecies  chimerism  of  donor  PSCs,  providing  a 
framework for generating human tissues in animals that are more suitable for transplant in the 
future.

Methods 
Animals and ethical review 
CD-1 (ICR), C57BL/6 and BDF1 mice were purchased from Envigo (Harlen), Charles River, or 
Jackson Laboratory. Homozygous Mavs knockout mice were kindly gifted from Prof. Zhijian J. 
Chen24. Mice were housed in 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle at 22.1–22.3°C and 33–44% humidity. 
All procedures related to animals were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Animal protocols were reviewed and 
approved by the UTSW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before any 
experiments  were  performed  (Protocols  #2018-102430).  All  experiments  followed  the  2021 
Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation released by the International Society 
for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR). All human–mouse ex vivo and in vivo interspecies chimeric 
experimental studies were reviewed and approved by UT Southwestern Stem Cell Oversight 
Committee (SCRO) (registration 14). 
 
Primed PSC culture 
Human ES cell line H9 (WA09) were obtained from WiCell and authenticated by short tandem 
repeat (STR) profiling. HFF-hiPS cells, mouse EpiSCs, rhesus macaque ES cells, and bovine ES 
cells were generated as previously described5,38,39. Human primed PSCs were either cultured on 
plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCell Technologies) or 
on MEFs in NBFR medium, which contains DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) and Neurobasal medium 
(Invitrogen)  mixed  at  1:1  ratio,  0.5×  N2  supplement  (Invitrogen),  0.5×  B27  supplement 
(Invitrogen), 2 mM GlutaMax (Gibco), 1× nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-
mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng mL−1 FGF2 (PeproTech), 2.5 μM IWR1 (Sigma-Aldrich), 
and 1 mg mL−1 BSA (low fatty acid, MP Biomedicals). Mouse, rhesus and bovine primed PSCs 
were all cultured on MEFs in NBFR medium. Primed PSCs cultured in NBFR medium were 
passaged using TrypLE (human, rhesus and bovine) at 1:10 split ratio every 4–5 days, and 1:30 
split ratio (mouse) every 3–4 days. Human primed PSCs cultured in mTeSR1 medium on Matrigel 
were passaged every five days using Dispase (STEMCell Technologies) at 1:10 split ratio.

We used pCAG-IP-mKO and pCAG-IP-eGFP to label PSCs as previously described10. For 
generating nucleus labelled PSCs, we used piggyBac transposon vectors expressing eGFP-H2B 
and mScarlet-H2B. In brief, 3 μg piggyBac-eGFP-H2B or piggyBac-mScarlet-H2B plasmids were 
transfected together with 1 μg piggyBac transposase plasmid into 1 × 106–2 × 106 dissociated PSCs 
using  NEPA21  electroporator  (Nepa  Gene)  following  the  protocol  recommended  by  the 
manufacturer. eGFP+ or mScarlet+ cells were collected by FACS at 48 h after transfection and 
replated. Single clones with stable fluorescence were manually picked between 7 and 14 days and 
further expanded clonally. 
 
Interspecies PSC co-culture 
PSCs from different species were seeded onto MEF-coated plates and either cultured separately or 
mixed at different ratios for co-cultures in NBFR medium. The seeding ratio and density were 
empirically tested and decided on the basis of cell growth rate. For 5-days-co-culture assays 
between human-mouse, rhesus-mouse and bovine-mouse PSCs, cells were seeded at a 4:1 ratio at 
a density of 1.25 × 104 cells cm−2. For human-mouse 3-days-co-culture, seeding density was 
increased to 1.875 × 104 cells cm−2 but seeding ratio was kept at 4:1. For transwell co-culture 
experiments, Millipore Transwell 0.4 μm PET hanging inserts (Millicell, MCH12H48) were 
placed into 12-well plates. Then coverslips were placed into both the upper insert and the bottom 
well, mEpiSCs and hES cells were seeded on the top insert and bottom well, respectively. At each 
of the indicated time points, cell concentration was manually counted and calculated, and the 
percentages of each cell line were determined using FACSCalibur system (BD Bioscience). Total 
cell  numbers  (tN)  for  each  species  in  co-cultures  or  separate  cultures  were  determined  by 
multiplying total cell volume (V) with cell concentration (CC) and percentage (P). tN = V × CC × 
P. Cell density (cells cm−2) was calculated by dividing the total cell number by the surface area. 
 
Micropattern imaging and automated cell counting 
The micropattern-based imaging was performed on CYTOO micropattern plates (CYTOOplate 
96w Custom A700-P400 A). Specifically, the micropattern wells were coated with 0.5% (v/v) 
Matrigel at 4 oC, O/N, and MEF feeder cells were seeded in each well one day before the 
experiment starts. On the day the experiment starts (day 0), unattached MEF feeder cells were 
washed out and then eGFP-H2B labeled WT or MavsKO mEpiSCs and/or mScarlet-H2B labeled 
H9 hES cells were seeded into each well separately or mixed as indicated in the main text. On days 
1-3, individual micropattern colonies were tracked by live imaging. Cells were then fixed and 
DAPI stained on day 3. Fluorescence imaging was performed on Nikon CSU-W1 SoRa spinning 
disk confocal microscope with 20x (0.75 NA, WD1 (air)) objective. Z-stacks were acquired for 
each  micropattern  colony  with  1µm  step,  approximately  30-75µm  range  in  Z  was  covered 
depending on the thickness of each colony. Imaging experiments were repeated at least three times 
with similar results. Cell counting was performed on Imaris (version 9.1, Oxford Instruments) by 
using the SPOTS function. Same parameters for computing of human and mouse cells were applied.

Time-lapse imaging and analysis 
For time-lapse imaging of co-cultures using bowtie-shaped microwells40, the photoresist template 
was fabricated by negative photolithography as previously described41. The chrome mask was 
manufactured by the University of Texas at Dallas, and KMPR 1050 photoresist (Microchem, 
Westborough, MA) was used following the manufacturers’ instructions. Silicon (PDMS) molds 
were fabricated from Sylgard 184 Silicon Elastomer (#24236-10 – Electron Micro Sciences, 
Hatfield, PA). These PDMS stamps were sealed to glass coverslips with features-side down. A 
solution of 1% Agarose (#MIDSCI500 – Midsci, St. Louis, MO) in distilled water (C = 10 mg/mL) 
was heated to 100 °C until the solution became crystal clear. Subsequently, 600 mL of this 1% 
agarose solution was mixed with 400 mL of 100% ethanol, and a drop of this hot agarose/ethanol 
solution was pipetted against the side of the PDMS stamp to perfuse through the gaps formed 
between the silicon mold and the coverslip. After several hours, the PDMS stamp was carefully 
removed from the coverslip with fine-tipped forceps. However, the agarose layers tend to detach 
from the glass coverslip in long-term cell culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO ). To solve this issue, 
2
we precoated the glass coverslips with an ultra-thin layer of polystyrene dissolved in chloroform 
(0.2 mg mL−1). A small drop of this mixture was added onto each coverslip, which was then spin-
coated  (~100  rpm  for  1-2  seconds  followed  by  ~3,000  rpm  for  4-6  second)  to  spread  the 
polystyrene uniformly. Finally, the coverslips were exposed to UV light in a tissue culture hood 
for 1 hour to graft the polystyrene layer prior to the addition of the agarose/ethanol solution. To 
setup an experiment, the coverslips holding the polystyrene/agarose layers were incubated with 
fibronectin in PBS (50 mg mL−1) for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed twice with PBS and dried several minutes 
before cells were seeded on the coverslips in culture media. After 48 hours of incubation, the 
coverslips with the cells were placed in a 37 °C / 5% CO  chamber for live imaging. The samples 
2
were imaged using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope, equipped with a 40x oil objective. 
A z-stack of 8 images (1,024 x 1,024 pixels, z-step size 2.5 µm) was recorded every 10 min for 24 
h. Fluorescent signals (488 and 561 nm) were collected sequentially to avoid any bleed-through 
using a 100 Hz scan rate. ImageJ (NIH, 64-bit Java 1.8.0_172) was used to produce a maximum 
intensity projection of each z-stack. All the resulting 2D images were assembled into time-lapse 
videos. 
 
CRISPR knockout 
All single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) used in this study were designed by using the online software 
(MIT CRISPR Design Tool: http://crispr.mit.edu). The sequences of sgRNAs are included in 
Supplementary Table 3. sgRNAs were cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-eGFP (Addgene, PX458) 
plasmid by ligating annealed oligonucleotides with BbsI-digested vector. 4 μg plasmid carrying 
the specific sgRNA was then transfected into 1 × 106–2 × 106 dissociated mEpiSCs using NEPA21 
electroporator (Nepa Gene). For generating large genomic fragment deletion at specific gene locus, 
two sgRNA plasmids were transfected simultaneously. eGFP+ cells were collected by FACS at 48 
h after transfection and replated. Single clones were picked and expanded. Homozygous knockout 
clones were confirmed by genomic PCR, Sanger sequencing and western blotting.

Plasmids 
pCAG-IP-mKO and pCAG-IP-eGFP plasmids were gifts from T. Hishida. piggyBac-eGFP-H2B 
and piggyBac transposase plasmids were gifts from Aryeh Warmflash lab. piggyBac-mScarlet-
H2B plasmid was generated by cloning mScarlet coding sequence and replaced eGFP coding 
sequence in piggyBac-eGFP-H2B. pSpCas9(BB)-2A-eGFP (PX458) plasmid was purchased from 
Addgene (plasmid 48138). 
 
Mouse embryo collection and electroporation 
Homozygous Mavs knockout or WT C57BL/6 female mice (4–11 weeks old) were superovulated 
by intraperitoneal (IP) injection with 7.5 IU of PMSG (Prospec), followed by IP injection with 7.5 
IU of hCG (Sigma-Aldrich) 48 h later. After mating with homozygous Mavs knockout or WT 
C57BL/6 male mice, respectively, embryos were harvested at E2.5 [the presence of a virginal plug 
was defined as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5)] in KSOM-Hepes5 by flushing oviducts and uterine horns. 
Embryos were cultured in the defined modified medium (mKSOMaa)5 until blastocyst stage. For 
generating  Mavs  knockout  blastocysts  by  CRISPR/Cas9  gene  editing,  mouse  zygotes  were 
collected from superovulated WT BDF1 female mice (3–4 weeks old) crossed with WT BDF1 
males at E0.5 and electroporated with RNP complex of Mavs targeting sgRNA (100 ng μL-1) and 
Cas9 protein (Takara Bio; 500 ng μL-1) using NEPA21 electroporator. The electroporated zygotes 
were cultured in mKSOMaa until blastocyst stage. Embryo culture was performed in a humidified 
atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO  and 20% (v/v) O  at 37 °C.

Microinjection of human iPS cells to mouse blastocysts 
Microinjection of human iPS cells into mouse blastocysts was performed as previously described10 
with slight modifications. Briefly, the embryos having obvious blastocoel at E3.5 were defined as 
blastocysts and fully expanded blastocysts were used for human iPS cell injections. Single cell 
suspensions  of  hiPS  cells  were  added  to  a  40  μL  droplet  of  KSOM-Hepes  containing  the 
blastocysts to be injected. Individual cells were collected into a 20 μm internal diameter of 
micropipette. Ten cells were introduced into the blastocoel near the ICM. Groups of 10–12 
blastocysts were manipulated simultaneously, and each session was limited to 30 min. After 
microinjection, the blastocysts were cultured in mKSOMaa for at least 1 h until the ex vivo embryo 
culture or embryo transfer. For ex vivo embryo culture, we followed the previous protocol25. In 
brief, injected chimeric blastocysts were placed in ibiTreat μ-plate 8 wells (ibidi GabH, 80826) 
containing IVC1 medium (Cell guidance systems, M11) and cultured for 3 days in a humidified 
atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO  and 5% (v/v) O  at 37 °C. IVC1 medium was replaced with 
2 2
equilibrated IVC2 medium (Cell guidance systems, M12) and cultured for additional 2 days. 
Embryos were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Echo Laboratories).

As  surrogates,  ICR  female  mice  (8  weeks  old  or  older)  in  the  proestrus  were  mated  with 
vasectomized ICR male mice to induce pseudopregnancy. Embryo transfer to the surrogate at E2.5 
performed surgically under anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine mixture (ARC UTSW). hiPSC-
injected blastocysts were loaded to the pipette with air bubble and transferred to the uterine horn, 
which were preliminary punctured with a 27G needle connected to a 1.5 mL syringe. 12–28 
blastocysts were transferred per surrogate. After the transfer, opioid analgesic (Buprenorphine 
HCL) was treated. Pregnant female mice were euthanized on E8.5-E9.5, embryos were dissected 
and used for downstream analysis. 
 
Genomic PCR 
Genomic PCR was performed for detecting human-specific DNA in mouse embryos by DNA 
fingerprinting using primers for TPA25-Alu. Genomic DNA of E8.5-E9.5 mouse embryos and 
HFF-hiPS cells (used as a positive control) were extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit 
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions, and then diluted to 30 ng μL-1 as PCR 
templates. Genomic PCRs were performed using Hot Start Taq 2x Master Mix (NEB). PTGER2 
primers that bind to conserved sequences in both human and mouse were used as internal control. 
The PCR products were examined by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer sequences are 
provided in Supplementary Table 3.  
 
Fluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry analysis of mouse embryos 
Imaging of chimeric embryos was performed with a Zeiss Axio Zoom.V16 fluorescence stereo 
zoom microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar Z 1.0x/0.25 (FWD 56 mm) objective and 
Axiocam  503  monochromatic  camera.  GFP-positive  embryos  were  embedded  in  O.C.T. 
compound (Fisher Healthcare) without fixation and frozen on dry ice. Sections (12 μm thick) were 
cut on a cryostat (Leica CM 1950), mounted on the glass slides (Denville Scientific), and stored at 
-80 °C for immunohistochemistry. All extra-sections and GFP-negative embryos were subjected 
to DNA extraction and genotyping for Mavs. For immunohistochemistry, sections were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS twice and permeabilized with 
0.3% Triton X-100 (Fisher BioReagents) in PBS twice for 5 min at room temperature. After 
antigen retrieval with 10 mM Citrate (pH 6.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher BioReagents) 
for 10 min at 90-95 °C, sections were blocked with blocking buffer [5% (w/v) donkey serum 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS] for 1 h. Then sections were incubated with 
the primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP, Supplementary Table 4) diluted in blocking buffer at 4 °C 
overnight, secondary antibody (Donkey anti-chicken IgY conjugated with FITC, Supplementary 
Table 4) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h, and finally 5 ng/mL DAPI solution at 
room  temperature  for  10  min.  Autofluorescence  was  silenced  with  TrueBlack  Lipofuscin 
Quencher (Biotium, diluted 1:20 in 70% ethanol) and slides were mounted with PVA-DABCO. 
Samples were imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700).

Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room 
temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked with 5% BSA and 
0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Incubation with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 4) in 1% 
BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 was performed overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with secondary 
antibodies (Supplementary Table 4) in 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 was performed for 1 h at 
room temperature. DAPI staining was applied for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were 
then mounted with PVA-DABCO on glass slides. The images of stained slides were taken by 
Revolve (ECHO) or Leica SP8 confocal microscope.  
 
Flow cytometry 
Cells were dissociated using TrypLE and fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. Then 
cells were resuspended with PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry was 
performed using FACSCalibur system (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo (10.8.1). 
 
Western blotting and Native gel electrophoresis 
For western blotting, cells were lysed with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 
protease inhibitor on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 g. The supernatant was mixed with 4× SDS 
Loading Buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled at 95˚C for 10 min. Samples were loaded into 4-20% Tris-
Glycine gel (Invitrogen Novex WedgeWell 4 to 20%, Tris-Glycine) and run at 150 V for 60 min. 
The gels were then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 5% milk in TBST. 
Membranes were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 4). 
Immunoreactive  bands  were  visualized  using  HRP  conjugated  secondary  antibodies 
(Supplementary  Table  4)  incubated  with  chemiluminescence  substrate  (Pierce  ECL  western 
substrate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposed to X-ray film. For native gel electrophoresis, 
cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% 
NP-40, 5 mM Na VO  and protease inhibitor) on ice followed by 12,000 g centrifugation. The 
3 4
supernatant was mixed with 5× Native Loading Buffer (125 mM Tris, 0.96 M Glycine, 40% 
Glycerol, 0.005% Bromophenol Blue and 2% DOC-Na). The Cathode Buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 
mM Glycine and 0.4% DOC-Na) and the Anode Buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM Glycine) were 
applied. 10% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen Novex 10% Tris-Glycine gel) was pre-run at 200V for 
70 min in the cold room until current dropped to 10 mA/Gel. The samples were loaded and run at 
200 V for 60 min in the cold room. The gels were then transferred, blocked with 5% milk in TBST 
and blotted with anti-IRF3 antibody (Supplementary Table 4). 
 
RNA isolation and quantitative RT–PCR analysis 
Both co-cultured and separately cultured cells were sorted out and collected based on fluorescent 
labelling using FACS at each of the indicated time points. Total RNAs were extracted using 
RNeasy  Mini  Kit  (Qiagen).  cDNA  was  synthesized  using  iScript™  Reverse  Transcription 
Supermix (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT–PCR) was carried out using 
SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) on CFX384 system (Bio-Rad). Reactions were run in triplicate

and  expression  level  of  each  gene  was  normalized  to  the  geometric  mean  of  Gapdh  as  a 
housekeeping gene and analysed by using the ΔΔCt method by Bio-Rad Maestro 1.0. The qRT–
PCR primer sequences of each gene are listed in Supplementary Table 3. 
 
Bulk RNA-seq quality control and data analysis 
RNA-seq reads were first filtered by SOAPnuke (Version: 1.5.6)42 with parameters “-l 15 -q 0.2 -
n 0.05 -Q 2”. The high-quality reads were mapped to the mouse genome (2020-A, mm10) and the 
human genome (2020-A, GRCh38) downloaded from the 10X Genomics website using HISAT2 
(Version: 2.1.0)43 with parameters “-k 1 -p 2 -S --novel-splicesite-outfile -q --no-unal --dta --un-
conc-gz”. SAMtools (Version: 1.5)44 was used to sort the BAM files produced by HISAT2. The 
expression levels of annotated genes were calculated by transcript per million (TPM) using 
StringTie (Version: 2.1.4)45 with parameters “-t -C -e -B -A -p 2”. Fold change was calculated by 
TPM+1 to avoid infinity. A fold change >= 2 or <= 0.5, a P value and an adjusted P value 
calculated by DESeq246 less than 0.05 and 0.1, were used as cutoffs to define differentially 
expressed genes. KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of up-regulated mouse and human genes 
were performed by DAVID47 (Version: 2021 Update) with mouse (Mus musculus) and human 
(Homo sapiens) as the backgrounds. Default thresholds (Count > 2, EASE < 0.1) were used to 
define enriched KEGG pathways. 
 
scRNA-seq quality control and data analysis 
scRNA-seq  reads  were  processed  by  Cell  Ranger  (Version:  5.0.1)  using  parameters  “--
localcores=24  --localmem=400  --transcriptome  --fastqs”  with  the  mouse  genome  annotation 
(2020-A, mm10) and the human genome annotation (2020-A, GRCh38). Multigenome analysis 
using the human-mouse genome (GRCh38-and-mm10-2020-A) of Cell Ranger was performed to 
distinguish mouse cells and human cells from cross-species doublets. scRNA-seq analysis was 
performed using Seurat (Version: 4.0.4)48. DoubletFinder (Version: 2.0.3)49 was used to remove 
intra-species doublets with parameters “pN = 0.25，nExp =round(0.05*length(colnames(obj)))”. 
Clusters of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were removed based on the following features: 
(1) they were present in all samples; (2) they were mouse cells; (3) they expressed marker genes 
of MEFs; and (4) they did not express marker genes of mEpiSCs. For mouse cells, cells with less 
than 500 genes or UMI less than 1,000 or mitochondrial ratio greater than 10% were removed. 
Finally, a total of 16,225 mouse cells were kept for further analysis. Cell clustering and Uniform 
Manifold  Approximation  and  Projection  (UMAP)  visualization  were  performed  using  the 
“FindClusters” and “RunUMAP” functions of Seurat, respectively. 
 
Identification of mouse-/human-specific and eGFP-/hKO-specific reads 
To identify species- or fluorescent gene-specific reads, the high-quality bulk RNA-seq of each 
sample and scRNA-seq reads of each cell were mapped to both mouse and human genomes, or 
eGFP and hKO sequences, respectively. Reads that could be mapped to both genomes or both 
fluorescent gene sequences were removed. This process was repeated many times until there were

only species- or fluorescent gene-specific reads left, which were used to calculate mouse/human 
genome mapping rates, measure eGFP/hKO expression levels, and detect eGFP+/hKO+ cells. 
Reads per million (RPM) was used to calculate normalized expression levels of human transcripts

Retrotransposable element analysis 
RNA sequencing fastq files were preprocessed with Cutadapt v. 1.18 and Prinseq v. 0.20.4 to 
remove residual adapter sequences, low quality reads and bases50,51. Remaining reads were aligned

v. 0.11.0 using only unique reads aligning to UCSC annotated gene transcripts53. The resulting 
gene counts file was used for Deseq2 v 2.11.40.6 TMM normalization and differential gene 
expression analysis46. Normalized stranded bigwig files for visualization were generated using the 
Deeptools v 3.0.1 BamCoverage tool (--binSize 5 --normalizeUsing CPM --minMappingQuality 
255 --filterRNAstrand forward/reverse --samFlagExclude 1024)54. Retroelement expression levels 
were determined using a customized pipeline55. A general transfer format (GTF) file containing 
RepeatMasker retroelement annotations was generated for the hg38 human and mm10 mouse 
genome assemblies56. This annotation file contains the genomic coordinates, strand, conservation 
scores relative to consensus sequence, and relational information for RepeatMasker each annotated 
repetitive element (element name, repeat family, and repeat class). We further identified and 
denoted the most highly conserved, full length retroelement copies present in these genomes. 
Reads aligning to individual repetitive elements, reads aligning to specific families of repeat 
elements, and reads aligning to repetitive sequences classes were counted using HTseq53. Reads 
multiply mapped to more than one individual copy of an element, element within a given family 
or class of elements were counted only once when calculating read counts at the element, class or 
family levels. Repetitive sequence read counts were normalized using the Deseq2 scale factors 
generated above.  As a quality control metric, reads derived from the opposite strand from the 
retroelement-encoding strand were also counted.  
 
Statistics 
Data were presented as mean ± s.e.m. from at least three independent experiments. Differences 
between  groups  were  evaluated  by  Student’s  t-test  (two-sided)  or  one-way  ANOVA  with 
Dunnett’s multiple comparison, and considered to be statistically significant if P < 0.05. Graphic 
analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software). Statistical analyses 
were done using the Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365).

by bulk RNA sequencing. 
a, Normalized abundance of human repeat elements in H9 hES cells (left) or mEpiSCs(right) aligned to the human 
genome (assembly HG38). Shown are repeat elements expressed in separately cultured H9 hES cells (Normalized 
Expression >20) and not detected in separately cultured mEpiSCs(Normalized Expression <20). Only reads 
uniquely assignable to a single repeat element type are shown. Heat maps were sorted on expression from high to 
low in H9 hES cells. b, Normalized abundance of near-consensus human repeat elements in H9 hES cells (left) or 
mEpiSCs(right). Shown are least divergent repeat elements (full-length relative to consensus, <10 mismatches or 
indels) that were expressed in separately cultured H9 hES cells (Normalized Expression >20) and were not detected 
in separately cultured mEpiSCs(Normalized Expression <20). Heat maps were sorted on expression from high to 
low in H9 hES cells. c-f, Expression of human repeat element classes (c), retroelement families (d), Alu (e) and 
evolutionarily young LINE1 (f) elements in H9 hES cells under different culture conditions. Sep, Co-d1, Co-d2, 
Co-d3, Sep-T and Co-T represent separate culture, co-culture on days 1, 2, 3, separate culture in transwell and co-
