22  Abstract 
23  Gap  junction  channels  (GJCs)  mediate  intercellular  communication  by  connecting  two 
24  neighboring cells and enabling direct exchange of ions and small molecules. Cell coupling via 
25  connexin-43 (Cx43) GJCs is important in a wide range of cellular processes in health and 
26  disease 1-3, yet the structural basis of Cx43 function and regulation has not been determined 
27  until now. Here we describe the structure of a human Cx43 GJC solved by cryo-EM and single 
28  particle analysis at 2.26 Å resolution. The pore region of Cx43 GJC features several lipid-like 
29  densities per Cx43 monomer, located close to a putative lateral access site at the monomer 
30  boundary. We found a previously undescribed conformation on the cytosolic side of the pore, 
31  formed by the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane helix 2 of Cx43 and stabilized by a 
32  small molecule. Structures of the Cx43 GJC and hemichannels in nanodiscs reveal a similar 
33  gate arrangement. The features of the Cx43 GJC and hemichannel cryo-EM maps and the 
34  channel properties revealed by molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the captured states 
35  of Cx43 are consistent with a closed state.

37  Introduction 
38  Gap junction (GJ) mediated intercellular communication is one of the major pathways of 
39  information exchange between the cells. GJs are specialized regions of the plasma membrane 
40  at the cell-cell interface that link two adjacent cells and establish their metabolic and electrical 
41  coupling 4. Connexins are the building blocks of the GJ channels (GJCs) which belong to a 
42  group of large-pore channels. This group includes a number of structurally related (innexins, 
43  pannexins, LRRC8) and unrelated proteins (CALHM) 5. A total of 21 connexin genes have 
44  been identified in the human genome 6. The 43 kDa connexin-43 (Cx43, gene name GJA1) was 
45  identified as a major constituent of rat heart GJs in 1987 7, and it is arguably one of the most 
46  extensively studied connexins. Like all connexin homologues, Cx43 monomers assemble into 
47  hexameric  hemichannels  (HCs),  also  known  as  connexons.  HCs  that  reach  the  plasma 
48  membrane of one cell may interact with their counterparts on the neighboring cell, forming 
49  GJCs, typically organized into hexagonal arrays at the intercellular interface 8. GJCs enable 
50  direct metabolic and electric coupling between the cells, facilitating the passage of ions, small 
51  molecules, metabolites, peptides and other cellular components below a size threshold of 
52  approximately 1.5 kDa 9. GJCs formed by Cx43 are crucial for a wide range of physiological 
53  processes,  from  propagation  of  heart  action  potentials  3  to  maintenance  of  neuro-glial 
54  syncytium 2 and skin wound healing 1. The clinical importance of Cx43 is highlighted by 
55  mutations linked to several genetic disorders, such as oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) 10-
56  12, hypoplastic left heart syndrome 1 13, Hallermann-Streiff syndrome 14, atrioventricular septal 
57  defect 3 13, etc., and by recognition of the protein as a drug target for treatment of cancer, skin 
58  wounds, eye injury and inflammation and cardiac arrhythmias (reviewed by Laird and Lampe 
59  9). 
60  Much of what we know today about the molecular biology, electrophysiological properties and 
61  regulation of connexin gap junctions has been derived from the studies on Cx43 (reviewed in 
62  15). Early attempts to characterize the structure of Cx43 using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-
63  EM)  of  2D  crystals  produced  low  resolution  reconstructions  16.  More  recently,  several 
64  homologous connexin GJCs and HCs have been structurally characterized at high resolution, 
65  using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. The structures of Cx26 17 and Cx46/50 GJCs 18,19, 
66  together with the recent structure of Cx31.3 HC 20 provided deep insights into the shared 
67  structural features of the connexin channels. These structures hint at the role of the N-terminal 
68  domain (NTD) in molecular gating of GJCs and HCs, with several conformations of the NTD 
69  observed in different connexin homologues 18-20. Additionally, biochemical evidence points to 
70  the roles in channel gating played by the link between Cx43 intracellular loop and the C-
71  terminal  region  21,22.  However,  despite  the  availability  of  this  evidence,  the  molecular 
72  determinants of intracellular connexin channel gating remain unclear. To shed light on the 
73  structural basis of Cx43 gating, we set out to determine its structure by cryo-EM and to analyse 
74  its dynamics with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

76  Results 
77  Structures of Cx43 GJC and HC in detergent micelles and in nanodiscs. Our Cx43 
78  expression system was tested using electrophysiology in HeLa cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a-
79  d). The experiments confirmed the functionality of Cx43 GJCs expressed in transfected cells. 
80  For large-scale protein expression, Cx43 featuring a C-terminal HRV3C-YFP-twinStrep tag, 
81  was expressed in adherent mammalian cells (HEK293F) using transient transfection method. 
82  The produced protein was purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography in 
83  digitonin (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c) and flash frozen on cryo-EM grids. The coomassie-stained 
84  SDS PAGE gel bands of the purified protein (Extended Data Fig. 2c) are consistent with the 
85  western blot analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2d) of the expressed untagged Cx43. The grids were

86  subjected to single particle cryo-EM analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3), yielding the final 3D 
87  reconstruction at 2.26 Å resolution (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 3-4).  
88  The overall architecture of the protein complex resembles that observed with other connexin 
89  GJCs, with two hemichannels (connexons) from adjacent plasma membrane regions coupled 
90  to form a full GJC (Fig. 1a-b). The exterior of the channel is decorated by several ordered 
91  detergent and/or lipid-like density elements (Fig. 1a-b), reminiscent of the previously observed 
92  lipids bound at the protein-bilayer interface in other connexins 19. In the case of Cx43, the lipid-
93  like densities appear to decorate the protein-lipid bilayer interface at both the inner and the 
94  outer leaflet of the membrane. Comparison of the Cx43 monomers to the available structures 
95  of  Cx26  and  Cx46  GJCs  and  the  Cx31.3  HC  revealed  a  major  difference  in  the  NTD 
96  arrangement in these channels (Fig. 1c-d). The conformation of the NTD in the Cx31.3 HC 
97  structure appears to be the closest to that in Cx43 GJC. Analysis of the tryptic peptides revealed 
98  that most of the protein lacks the residue M1 (Extended Data Fig. 5), and thus the model was 
99  built starting with G2. 
100  To ascertain that the conformation of Cx43 GJC is not induced by the detergent present in the 
101  sample, e.g. through detergent binding at specific sites on the protein surface, we removed the 
102  detergent and reconstituted the protein into MSP2N2 nanodiscs, using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-
103  glycero-3-phosphocholine  (POPC)  as  a  mimic  for  the  native  lipid  environment.  The 
104  reconstituted protein was subjected to the same imaging and analysis workflow as Cx43 GJC 
105  in digitonin. The 2D classes of the MSP2N2-reconstituted Cx43 showed features consistent 
106  with a mixture of GJCs and HC. Processing of the corresponding particles resulted in 3D 
107  reconstructions of the Cx43 GJC at 2.95 Å resolution (Extended Data Fig. 6, 8) and HC in 
108  nanodiscs at 3.98 Å resolution (Fig. 1e-f, Extended Data Fig. 7, 8). The GJCs in detergent and 
109  in nanodiscs are nearly identical, with an RMSD of 0.97 Å between the aligned Cx43 
110  monomers (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 9a). Although the differences between the HC in 
111  nanodisc and the GJC are more pronounced (Extended Data Fig. 9a), the conformation of the 
112  cytosolic region and the NTD is highly conserved (Fig. 1g). 
113  Conformation of the Cx43 gate region. The reconstructed gate region of Cx43 shows several 
114  narrow openings connecting the pore vestibule and the pore interior: a single ~6-7 Å wide 
115  central opening and six adjacent openings of similar dimensions (Fig. 2a-b). This arrangement 
116  of the gate region is distinct from any of the previously observed states of connexin GJCs or 
117  HCs. This particular gate conformation is established through an interplay of two structural 
118  elements: the NTD and the TM2 (Fig. 2c-d). The NTD of Cx43 is arranged near parallel to the 
119  membrane plane, in a centre-oriented conformation (Fig. 2c). The HC of Cx31.3 assembles in 
120  a similar manner, with a well-ordered NTD resolved by cryo-EM (Fig. 2c-d). However, the 
121  TM2 region of Cx31.3 forms a tight seal with the NTD (Fig. 2e). In contrast, the TM2 of Cx43 
122  is shifted away from the pore centre, creating six openings (Fig. 2f). Alignment of the 
123  protomers of Cx43 and Cx31.3 showed an RMSD of 1.78 Å (using cealign in PyMol). In 
124  contrast, the RMSD value for the region corresponding to the NTD and TM2 was 5.675 Å 
125  (calculated using rms_cur in PyMol, with the residue range selections of 2-47 and 2-45 for the 
126  aligned protomers of Cx43 and Cx31.3, respectively), further confirming that these two regions 
127  differ substantially between Cx43 and Cx31.3. The arrangement of the Cx43 NTD appears to 
128  be stabilized by a small molecule: a density element likely corresponding to a bound small 
129  molecule is present within this region (referred to as the “NTD lipid site”), wedged between 
130  the adjacent NTDs (Fig. 2g). Thus, although the conformation of the Cx43 gate features an 
131  opening, this site is blocked by a yet unidentified small molecule (which we refer to as “lipid-
132  N”). 
133  While a direct comparison of the Cx43 gating regions of the Cx43 and Cx31.3 HCs is possible 
134  (Extended Data Fig. 9c), the recently determined 3D reconstruction of the Cx26 mutant N176Y

135  was not accompanied by a new atomic model 23. Instead the study reporting this reconstruction 
136  compared the density map with an HC model from a Cx26 GJC structure (PDB ID: 5ERA) 24. 
137  As this model lacks the NTD, any comparisons of the gating region in the Cx43 HC with that 
138  in the Cx26 HC are presently limited (Extended Data Fig. 9d). 
139  In addition to the lipid-N molecules stabilizing the NTD arrangement, the cryo-EM density of 
140  Cx43 GJC features several well resolved densities inside the pore region (lipid-1 and lipid-2, 
141  Fig. 2h). These elements likely correspond to bound sterol molecules, such as cholesterol co-
142  purified with the protein from the mammalian cells or cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) added 
143  to the solubilization mixture during protein extraction from the membrane. Similar densities 
144  are present in the Cx43 GJC reconstruction in nanodiscs, in the absence of detergent molecules 
145  (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Additionally, it is noteworthy that the annular lipid densities are 
146  conserved  in  both  the  detergent-solubilized  and  the  nanodisc-reconstitued  Cx43  GJCs, 
147  indicating that the protein-lipid interface of Cx43 features sites where ordered lipid molecules 
148  may bind (Extended Data Fig. 10b). The functional significance of the ordered annular lipids 
149  for the channel activity and for GJ plaque assembly remains to be carefully investigated. 
150  Identification of the lipid-like molecules bound to Cx43 is a significant challenge. Despite the 
151  high overall resolution of the 3D reconstruction of the Cx43 GJC (2.26 Å resolution in 
152  detergent and 2.95 Å in nanodisc; Extended Data Fig. 3, 6), the cryo-EM map features in 
153  regions  corresponding  to  the  lipid  densities  are  insufficient  to  assign  the  lipid  identity 
154  unambiguously. To determine the identities of these lipids experimentally, we performed 
155  lipidomic analysis of the organic extracts prepared from the purified Cx43 samples and 
156  compared them to the mock control (extracts of prepared from eluates of the purification 
157  procedure using cells that do not overexpress the protein as starting material). The results 
158  showed that several types of phospholipids, as well as cholesterol were present in both samples. 
159  The  only  lipid-like  compound  specifically  enriched  in  the  purified  sample  was 
160  dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; Extended Data Fig. 10c). DHEA is a most abundantly 
161  expressed neurosteroid known to modulate ligand-gated ion channels, such as GABA  25 or 
A
162  NMDA and AMPA receptors 26. Although we are presently not able to conclusively state that 
163  DHEA corresponds to any of the densities present in our reconstruction, its enrichment in the 
164  sample is an interesting observation that deserves detailed future investigations. While the 
165  density corresponding to lipid-N may correspond to DHEA (Extended Data Fig. 4e), it is also 
166  possible that this density corresponds to a larger molecule that is only partially ordered. 
167  Cx43 junction interface. As in other connexins, the Cx43 GJC interface is formed by two 
168  extracellular loops, ECL1 and ECL2 (Fig. 3a-b). The portion of the ECL1 comprising residues 
169  N55-Q58 makes contacts with two Cx43 monomers from the opposite membrane, with N55-
170  Q58 of one monomer and Q58’-P59’ of the neighboring monomer within 4 Å distance (Fig. 
171  3c, top left). The ECL2 region that directly participates in sealing the junction includes residues 
172  P193-D197. Comparisons of the junction-forming loops in Cx43 to those in Cx46 (Fig. 2c, 
173  middle) and Cx26 (Fig. 2c, right) show that each protein uses a similar pattern of inter-HC 
174  interaction within each GJC. It is noteworthy that both the amino acid sequences (Fig. 3d) and 
175  the interaction networks (Fig. 3c) are similar in the ECL1 for Cx43 and Cx46, and in the ECL2 
176  for Cx46 and Cx26. The differences in these two loops, and especially in ECL2, underlie the 
177  inability of Cx43 (which has been grouped into a docking group 2) to engage in heterotypic 
178  interactions with group 1 connexins (such as Cx46 and Cx26) 27. Our structure is thus in line 
179  with the recognized consensus motif necessary for heterotypic complementarity of connexin 
180  GJCs 28. 
181  Conformation of the Cx43 hemichannel. Although the two Cx43 GJC structures (in detergent 
182  micelles and in nanodiscs) are almost identical, the Cx43 HC shows a notable difference in the 
183  ECL1-2 conformation (Fig. 3e-f). The resolution of the HC reconstruction does not allow us to 
184  make definitive statements about the orientations of individual side chains, but it is clear that

185  both loops engaging in junction formation move inward upon docking of the two HCs (Fig. 
186  3f). This conformational change likely involves intra- and intermolecular cooperativity. The 
187  ECL1 and ECL2 are linked via several disulphide bonds, and thus the rearrangement within 
188  each molecule would require concerted movement of the whole extracellular domain (ECD). 
189  The ECD movement within one monomer is likely cooperatively coupled to the neighboring 
190  chains within the Cx43 HC. 
191  Disease-linked mutations in Cx43. A number of disease-linked mutations associated with 
192  Cx43 can be mapped directly to three regions of interest revealed by our structures: (i) the GJC 
193  intra-pore lipid-like site, (ii) the ECD, and (iii) the gating region (Fig. 4a). The interior of the 
194  channel features two lipid-like densities (Fig. 2h, 4b; Extended Data Fig. 4e, 10a). The 
195  observed position of lipid 1 is consistent with the previously found phospholipid-like densities 
196  inside the pore of the Cx31.3 HC 20. Lipid 2 inserts into the pocket formed by TM1 and TM2, 
197  parallel with the NTD. Unlike Cx31.3, where elongated densities within the pore region could 
198  be interpreted as hydrophobic tails of bound phospholipids, the density in the Cx43 GJC 
199  appears consistent with that of a sterol (Fig. 2h, 4b). The presence of a small hydrophobic small 
200  molecule in Cx43 at this site suggests a potential mechanism of lipid-based Cx43 regulation, 
201  whereby binding of a lipid could directly influence the conformation of the gating elements of 
202  the protein (such as NTD). An effect of a cholesterol analogue 7-ketocholesterol on Cx43 
203  permeability has been observed previously 29, and such an effect may be mediated via the 
204  binding sites within the GJC (or HC) pore (Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 10a). The presence 
205  nearby of several residues known to be linked to ODDD when mutated (S27P, I31M30, S86Y31, 
206  L90V10) points to a potential functional significance of the intra-pore lipid binding site. 
207  Two known mutations linked to ODDD are located in the Cx43 ECD: P59 in ECL1 32 and 
208  H194 in ECL2 33. As suggested by the Cx43 GJC structures, these residues are located in 
209  conserved regions where any substitution can be expected to cause disruption of the contacts 
210  critical for junction formation (Fig. 4c). 
211  Multiple mutations in Cx43 associated with ODDD are located in the N-terminus (G2V, D3N, 
212  L7V, L11I/P, Y17S, S18P), the TM1 region (G21R, G22E, K23T) and the TM2 region 
213  proximal to the gate (V96M/E/A, Y98C, K102N) 11. In some cases, the mutations reduce the 
214  ability of Cx43 to form the gap junction plaques at the plasma membrane, as is the case for 
215  Y17S or G21R (as well as L90V, located at the pore lipid binding site) 34. The mutations tend 
216  to have deleterious effects on the permeability of Cx43 to ions and small molecules 11. The 
217  mutations G2V, D3N, W4A and L7V were shown to eliminate the function of Cx43 GJCs 35. 
218  Interestingly, a G8V amino acid substitution has been linked to palmoplantar keratoderma and 
219  congenital alopecia 1 (PPKCA1). This mutant can form functional gap junctions and has 
220  enhanced HC activity 36. Mapping these sites on the structure of Cx43 allows us to gain insights 
221  into the possible mechanisms that underlie the associated disorders (Fig. 4d-e). For example, 
222  channel blockage or hyperpermeability due to mutations in or around the gating region may 
223  link Cx43 to diseases. 
224  Molecular dynamics simulations of Cx43 GJC. Based on our model of Cx43, the dimensions 
225  of the pore opening are likely incompatible with the translocation of a larger molecule, such as 
226  ATP, cAMP or IP3 (typical substrates of Cx43 GJC-mediated transport). To assess the 
227  permeability of the gate to ions, we performed MD simulations. We performed eighteen 
228  independent molecular dynamics simulations of the Cx43 GJC embedded in a double POPC 
229  bilayer solvated in 150 mM KCl. Given the ambiguity in the lipid identity and binding mode, 
230  in the first set of simulations, no potential lipid surrogates were included inside the pore or 
231  NTD region. After equilibration (detailed in Materials and Methods) the dodecameric structure 
232  was stable in all simulations, as indicated by the small root mean square deviation (RMSD, 
233  Extended Data Fig. 11 a,d).

234  The pore opening has a solvent-accessible radius of ~6Å (Figure 5c) very close to the effective 
235  hydrated radius of K+ (~6.6 Å) and Cl- (~7.2 Å). This makes it the most narrow pore opening 
236  observed for a connexin channel to date (a comparison of the pore openings in the cryo-EM 
237  structures of connexin channels is shown in Extended Data Fig. 12). The NTD regions of Cx43 
238  are flexible (Extended Data Fig. 13) and can move laterally and vertically (Movie 1), allowing 
239  the passage of ions. The charge distribution inside Cx43 resembles that of the other GJCs 18,19,37 
240  with a positive electrostatic potential in the NTD region of both HCs within a channel and a 
241  negative/neutral region near the HC interface (Fig. 5c). When no transmembrane potential is 
242  applied (0 mV, Fig. 5b), Cl- ions accumulate in the NTD regions of Cx43 GJC (anion density 
243  peaks in the NTD region ) as previously observed for C31.3 37. At 0 mV, there is an entry 
244  barrier of ~3.38 kcal/mol for cations (K+) in the NTD region of both HCs (Figure 5d) which is 
245  slightly higher than previously reported PMFs values for other homomeric GJCs (Cx46/50) 18. 
246  Conversely, anions can permeate the NTD region barrierless (Figure 5d), but they face a higher 
247  barrier ~3.84 kcal/mol below this region where the electrostatic potential of the channel is 
248  negative, as observed for other GJC 18. Because the NTD domains are flexible, but they do not 
249  fully fold inwards, most ions enter and exit the same HC (Extended Data Table 2). Application 
250  of a transjunctional voltage lowers the barrier on one HC increasing the number of permeation 
251  events. Very few full transjuctional permeation events were observed during the simulations 
252  with any applied voltage. 
253  As mentioned before, the GJC did not fully open in any of our simulations, i.e., a conformation 
254  with all NTDs within the channel symmetrically moving to open the pore was not established 
255  at any point. To illustrate this effect, we calculated the root-mean-square deviation for each 
256  NTD domain in all simulations (Extended Data Fig. 13). Only at high applied transjunctional 
257  voltages only one NTD domain adopted a fully open folded inward conformation (Extended 
258  Data Fig. 13). 
259  The MD simulations in the absence of a bound ligand reveal an intermediate, metastable state 
260  in  which  ions  can  permeate  from  both  HCs  with  similar  free-energy  barriers  and  full 
261  transjunctional  permeations  are  very  rare  events.  The  GJC  selectivity  and  conductance 
262  properties are modulated by complex mechanisms involving both the steric aperture and the 
263  unique pattern of electrostatic features. In our case, the electrostatic properties of the channel 
264  are similar to those published for the Cx46/50 channels 18, but the steric contribution of the 
265  NTD region is significantly higher, increasing the barrier for K+, resulting in smaller ΔΔG 
266  differences than those observed for the open channel (Cx46/50). Other MD studies have shown 
267  similar energy barriers for ions 18, leading to entry events but very rare full translocations on 
268  the molecular dynamics timescale. Therefore, in the absence of the ligand the channel may 
269  exhibit a low residual conductance, as described experimentally 38. 
270  Despite not knowing the precise identity of the lipid-N, we performed nine MD simulations of 
271  the Cx43 HC with a DHEA molecule as a lipid-N surrogate bound between the adjacent chains 
272  (Fig. 5e, Extended Data Fig. 14a,b, Movie 2), to understand whether the channel is closed in 
273  the presence of the lipid molecule. As expected, even when applying high transmembrane 
274  voltage the ion density for both species, K+ and Cl-, in the NTD region remained zero and no 
275  permeation events were observed (Fig. 5e, Extended Data Fig. 14c). Hence, the presence of the 
276  bound lipid-N molecule seals the channel by rigidifying the NTD domains. 
277   
278  Discussion 
279  The structures of Cx43 we have obtained by cryo-EM reveal a novel conformation of a 
280  connexin channel (both GJC and HC) featuring a closed molecular gate. The state is distinct 
281  from the previously observed structures of connexin GJCs and HCs, adding an important 
282  missing component to our understanding of connexin-mediated intercellular communication.

283  With these structures in mind, we can now establish the existence of several structurally 
284  defined gating substates of the connexin channels: (i) a fully open gate, (ii) a semi-permeable 
285  central gate, and (iii) a closed gate (Fig. 6). The gating mechanisms of connexin HCs and GJC 
286  are complex and involve multiple components. The available evidence indicates that connexin 
287  channels are gated by membrane potential (V ), by transjunctional potential (V), as well as by 
m j
288  a range of chemical agents such as pH, Ca2+ and organic molecules 38. For example, a ball-and-
289  chain model has been proposed for Cx26, whereby at low pH the NTDs extend deep into the 
290  pore and occlude the substrate translocation pathway 39. This conformation is distinct from the 
291  one captured by our cryo-EM reconstructions, and it is possible that under certain conditions 
292  the Cx43 NTD may transition from the observed conformation to a low pH Cx26-like state. It 
293  is worth mentioning that for the Cx43 HCs the open probability has been shown to be very low 
294  40,  and  thus  a  closed  conformation  such  as  the  one  described  here  may  represent  the 
295  predominant state of the channel. 
296  The cytosolic surface of the gate in our structures is positively charged, indicating that specific 
297  interaction with anions may be relevant to some of the gating events. As Cx43 is capable of 
298  cation and anion permeation 41, the presence of the positively charged surface in this region 
299  does not indicate ion selectivity. The differences in the electrostatic properties of the gates and 
300  the pore regions in different connexin channels may reflect the differences in their selectivity 
301  for ions and small molecules (Extended Data Fig. 12). However, it is also likely that the 
302  unstructured regions in Cx43 and other connexins, including the intracellular loop and the C-
303  terminal domain, contribute to the electrostatic potential, substrate selectivity and regulation of 
304  these  channels.  These  domains  are  known  to  play  important  roles  in  connexin  channel 
305  regulation  42.  However,  as  these  regions  are  unresolved  in  any  of  the  available  3D 
306  reconstructions  of  connexin  channels,  the  structural  basis  of  their  action  remains  to  be 
307  determined. 
308  The observation of lipid-like molecules bound inside the pore is intriguing. The use of 
309  detergents and lipids is currently a prerequisite for structural analysis of membrane proteins, 
310  and it is possible that under solubilization conditions the abundance of added detergent and 
311  lipid (CHS) forces the protein to interact with these molecules. Nevertheless, these interactions 
312  may correspond to the naturally occurring interactions with the endogenous lipids present in 
313  the lipid bilayer of the cell. The presence of such molecules could have important implications 
314  for  HC  or  GJC  assembly,  substrate  permeation  and  molecular  gating.  It  remains  to  be 
315  determined whether Cx43 or other connexin channels harbour intra-pore lipids in the cellular 
316  membranes in vivo. 
317  Distinct gating modes have been shown in the literature for both Cx43 HCs and GJCs, with 
318  fast transitions from an open state to a state of residual conductance, and slow transitions from 
319  an open to a fully closed state 38. The structures of Cx43 described here may represent the 
320  closed states, based on the cryo-EM- and MD simulation-based evidence. The closed state 
321  could be stabilized by a yet unknown agent that occupies the NTD lipid site formed by the 
322  arrangement of the NTDs and TM2 regions observed in our structures. It is worth noting that 
323  the majority of Cx43 channels in a GJ plaque are closed, with only a small fraction of the 
324  channels active 43. Detailed investigations of Cx43 and other connexin channels will be 
325  required to determine whether the gate conformation observed here is a common feature among 
326  different GJCs and HCs, and to pinpoint the physiological circumstances that establish this 
327  gating  conformation.  Finally,  capturing  the  structures  of  Cx43  channels  in  distinct 
328  conformations under a wide range of physiologically relevant conditions will be required to 
329  establish its mechanism of action, gating and regulation.
