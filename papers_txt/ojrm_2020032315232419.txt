1. Introduction 
According to national headline news reported every morning in China, as of 
March 18, 2020, 198,127 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 around 
the world with 7976 deaths and 107,376 sick survivors. Of the 82,775 rehabili-
tated patients, 84.3% are in China. Non-Chinese deaths have already exceeded 
Chinese deaths by 1492, and the death toll is rapidly rising, specifically in Italy 
and Iran.  
Beginning at around February 14, non-Chinese cases are increasing exponen-
tially and have no sign of plateauing for at least four months according to pre-
vious Chinese experience. It is long-overdue for WHO and national health or-
ganizations to implement scientifically superior protocols of therapies that are 
available to save human lives.

According to press conference reports of the National Health Commission of 
the People’s Republic of China (NHCPRC), COVIDS-19 in China is characte-
rized by having 85% of its patients, usually between the ages of 15 to 55, exhibit-
ing mild symptoms that disappeared within two weeks of treatment with anti-
biotics, steroids or the Chinese herb of Ban Lan Geng. These patients were in 
good general health before being contaminated, and had spontaneously devel-
oped antibodies against the Coronaviruses and their antigens. These antibodies 
were found in the lymph, serum, plasma, and whole blood in good titers of the 
rehabilitated individuals.  
Without considering the complete implication of transfusion immunology, 
especially when no approved viral medication readily available, researchers often 
grasped convalescent plasma as the last straw because of its simplicity in usage 
and needing no FDA/EMA/CFDA regulatory approval. On February 19, 2020, 
the NHCPRC, on the recommendation of academicians and experts, announced 
that convalescent plasma was adopted as one of the treatment programs for 
COVID-19. 
However, in the 2014 systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis by a 
panel made up of essentially WHO experts, it was concluded that, “Convalescent 
plasma may reduce mortality and appears safe. This therapy should be studied 
within the context of a well-designed clinical trial or other formal evaluation…”. 
The authors stated in the Results, “We identiﬁed 32 studies of SARS coronavirus 
infection and severe inﬂuenza. Narrative analyses revealed consistent evidence 
for a reduction in mortality, especially when convalescent plasma is adminis-
tered early after symptom onset”. “Studies were commonly of low or very low 
quality, lacked control groups, and at moderate or high risk of bias” [1]. 
It appears that formal evaluation is deemed necessary, prioritizing serum 
therapy over plasma therapy in the context of presenting less foreign antigens, 
thus evoking less allogeneic sensitization and providing greater safety and effi-
cacy in treatment. This is in the same context of prioritizing plasma therapy over 
whole blood transfusion in viral encounters because of better transplantation 
immunology. 
2. Formal Evaluation 
Both serum therapy and plasma therapy are passive immunotherapies that allo-
geneic sensitization must be reduced to a bare necessity to avoid allergic or fatal 
adverse reactions. This is the guiding principle of transplantation immunology. 
Any deviation can be fatal, leaving the critically- or terminally-ill patients dead 
by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. A 
formal evaluation of the two therapies is listed below. 
1) Both convalescent serum and plasma contain the antiviral antibodies, and 
as such, both can be useful to combat COVID-19. However, by definition, plas-
ma is composed of albumin, fibrinogen and numerous clotting factors. These 
allogeneic antigens produce blood clots when exposed to the recipient’s platelets

during plasma transfusion. These are sensitizing epitopes that must be removed 
to avoid future complications and ARDS. I shall not elaborate further on the se-
riousness of overloading the host immune system with a large amount of fibri-
nogen as previously reported. Its significance cannot be underestimated because 
it usually leads to death of the critically- and terminally-ill patients [2]. The 
presence of various allogeneic clotting factors in the host blood stream will lead 
to graft-versus-host reactions that cause allergy and overt immunologic rejec-
tion. Why insist on having these potential risks when it is so easy to switch to 
serum therapy? Serum, by nomenclature, is the remain of plasma after the clot-
ting proteins and factors are removed. 
In the pioneering development of gene therapies and cell therapies treating 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy [3]-[7], ischemic cardiomyopathy [8]-[13], Type 
II diabetes [14] [15] [16] [17], cancer [18] [19] and aging disfigurement [13] [17] 
[19] spanning nearly 30 years, host serum has always been the medium of choice 
to carry allogeneic human myoblasts into the recipients. The simple but effective 
procedures of serum extraction were designed to be used in areas where social 
economy prevails far less behind the devastation of COVID-19.  
Serum for Therapy 
After meeting the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria that are specific for different 
country, religion and denomination, and signing of the Donor Informed Con-
sent, whole blood was drawn slowly and steadily under GLP conditions by a cer-
tified phlebotomist from the median cubital vein of the rehabilitated volunteer 
donor through a 21-gauge butterfly needle taped in place. Four 60-mL syringes 
each containing 3 mL of anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution are used to col-
lect approximately a total 240 mL of whole blood. Depending on the physical 
condition of the donor, the procedure can be repeated in two weeks. 
Under GMP conditions, the blood collected is distributed evenly into four 60 
mL conical glass centrifuge tubes of a refrigerated centrifuge maintained at 4˚C 
to 8˚C. Centrifugation was maintained at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes [19]. The su-
pernatant is pipetted out and transferred immediately with a sterile pipet-aid 
into a sterile 300 mL flask under a Biologic Safety Cabinet with no air exchange 
in both directions. The precipitate of blood cells in each tube was mixed with 50 
mL of ice-chilled saline, vortexed for 10 minutes, aspirated and injected slowly 
with a syringe into the donor’s blood stream through the same route of phle-
botomy, the median cubital vein. Care must be taken not to introduce any air in 
the system.  
The flask of nearly cell-free plasma is put under a strong ultra-violet light for 4 
hours and then stored overnight in a refrigerator maintained at 4˚C to 8˚C. On 
the next day, the clear serum overlying the soft dark red clot is careful pipetted 
out and force-filtered through a silicon 0.22-micrometer filter with a power 
pump. The clear filtrate with a mild yellow color is the antiserum for transfu-
sion. A 3-mL test sample is pipetted out to confirm absence of HIV, HAV, HBV, 
HCV, CMV, syphilis, bacteria, mycoplasma, and endotoxin for quality assur-

ance. Another 0.5 mL sample is also taken for record keeping. It will be chilled 
to −80˚C overnight, then transferred to the cryo-tank storage with liquid ni-
trogen.  
ELISA tests will be conducted to determine absence of viral antigens and po-
tency of the antibodies. According to CNBG, 95.4% of the donors showed titers 
of antiviral antibodies IgG, ranging from 68% of the plasma collected having 
high titers > 1:320/mL and moderate titers > 1:160/mL, to 31.7% at low or no ti-
ters < 1:160/mL [20].  
All samples of antisera with the same blood type will be pooled to include 
greater numbers and quantity of antibodies. 
Serum Therapy 
Serum therapy will produce the best results when administered between the 
first and the second week of infection. This is to provide passive immunogens 
leading the host’s neutralizing antibodies/IgG production against lesser quality 
and quantity of viral antigens. Towards this end, early diagnosis and treatment 
are crucial before the disease advances to the critical stage. This does not mean 
that serum therapy is not effective in critically- and terminally-ill cases. In fact, it 
is specially designed for them. 
After meeting the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria that are specific for different 
countries, religion and denomination, and signing the Treatment Informed Con-
sent, patients receive serum therapy from Board-certified physicians under GCP 
conditions. All participants are properly gowned, masked and hooded, with 
gloves and shoe-covers, to prevent infection. A certified phlebotomist gains access to 
the recipient’s median cubital vein, while transfusion of the processed serum is 
conducted by at least one Board-certified physician, accompanied by a cardi-
opulmonary specialist and two nurses. ABO-compatible identical antiserum 
having moderate titers or above will be injected slowly at 5 mL/kg body weight 
of the patient. The treatment procedure can be repeated on the next day if 
needed.  
2) Post-transfusion mortality among recipients of ABO-compatible but non- 
identical plasma is a common, inadvertent event associated with convalescent 
plasma  transfusion.  In  the  world’s  largest  study  of  86,082  Swedish  patient 
records obtained from the SCANDAT database with the patients receiving their 
ﬁrst plasma transfusion between 1990 and 2002, 24% was exposed to compatible 
non-identical plasma. In emergency situation such as COVID-19, exposure was 
inadvertent, and exposure rate had to be higher. The Swedish group of exposed 
patients demonstrated, in a 14-day-follow-up study, an increased mortality of 
about 10% as a result of non-identical blood type matching, with higher risks 
in group O recipients, especially when the compatible plasma was from group 
AB donors. This increase in mortality of 1033 deaths is highly significant con-
sidering the large population of patients involved. Circulating immune com-
plexes (CICs) were implicated as the cause of death [21]. Patients who received 
ABO-compatible nonidentical plasma also had a significantly higher incidence 
of ARDS [22]. In emergency lifesaving resuscitation, the risk of hemolytic trans-

fusion reactions from transfusion of group O blood to nongroup O recipients 
constitutes risk that is outweighed by the beneﬁts [23]. I had previously empha-
sized the need for direct blood type matching in the proposed serum protocol 
[2]. 
3) There were concerns expressed over lack of donors to provide sufficient 
plasma. With 69,739 patients already rehabilitated, and 8182 still sick in China, 
there is plenty of plasma available. Sizeable stocks of A, B, O, AB+ and AB-antisera 
can be obtained by pooling independent samples of the same blood type to in-
clude all antiviral antibodies to maximize the potency of the antisera for neutra-
lizing the viral antigens from different mutations. 
4) COVID-19 in China is likely to subside to a minimum by the end of March 
as predicted [2]. Death toll on March 17, 2020 was 11. After treating the 2622 
critically-ill and terminally-ill patients most of whom are over the age of 60, 
China should have enough antisera to treat non-Chinese cases until there is enough 
donated plasma from rehabilitated patients overseas. 
5) Manufacture technology of IgG and IgG fragments are now available if 50 L 
of antisera pooled from all blood types can be spared for this specific purpose. 
Accordingly, if each of the rehabilitated individual that has not donated would 
donate 100 mL of their precious blood towards that end, there will be opportunity 
to produce highly purified whole IgG and IgG fragments according to the WHO 
guidelines for the production, control and regulation of IgG published in year 
2010. Whole IgG against SARS coronavirus was found present in the patient’s 
blood 3 years after rehabilitation [24]. 
This will take time. For now, it is serum therapy. 
3. Conclusion 
This is the first report to have documented plausible mechanisms and transfu-
sion immunology in support of the emergent use of serum therapy to combat 
COVID-19 and future viral or bacterial pathogenic pandemics. The safety and 
efficacy that it demonstrated, though preliminary, lead the way to develop a new 
treatment for infectious diseases. Lacking graft-versus-host reactions, convales-
cent antisera and their IgG derivatives are safe biologics. Apart from this scien-
tific treatise, well-designed randomized, double-blinded clinical trials have to be 
conducted at their earliest comparing the safety and efficacy of serum therapy 
versus plasma therapy.
