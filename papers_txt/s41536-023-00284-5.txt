Higherhomogeneity andreproducibility ofmodiﬁed AR
methodcompared to conventional ARmethod
To evaluate the AR operation homogeneity and reproducibility,
we trained 5 operators to perform both the conventional and
modiﬁed AR method. Conventional AR was accomplished by
gently resecting the ventricular apex until the LV chamber was
exposed3. The surgical AR procedure from anesthesia to chest
closure should be limited within 10min for both methods. For
achievingasurgicalprocedure within10min,we observedthat
each operator needed to operate more mice (≈1.5 to 3 fold)
when they learned and practiced conventional AR method
comparedtomodiﬁedARmethod.Thentheyperformedformal
experiments for comparison of conventional and modiﬁed AR
methods. In the present study, each operator performed AR
surgery in P1 neonatal mice using conventional (n=5) and
modiﬁed (n=5) AR method, respectively. Based on the
measuredresectedareasofLVapex,wecalculatedthestandard
deviation (SD) and relative standard deviation (RSD) in the
modiﬁed or conventional AR method for each operator.
