45  Abstract 
46  Antibodies capable of neutralising SARS-CoV-2 have been well studied, but the Fc receptor-dependent 
47  antibody activities that also significantly impact the course of infection have not been studied in such 
48  depth. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antibody-dependent NK cell responses targeting multiple antigens, 
49  however, as most vaccines induce only anti-spike antibodies, we investigated spike-specific antibody-
50  dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Vaccination produced antibodies that only weakly induced ADCC, 
51  however, antibodies from individuals who were infected prior to vaccination (‘hybrid’ immunity) elicited 
52  much stronger anti-spike ADCC. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of humoral immunity contributed to 
53  this capability, with infection skewing IgG antibody production towards S2, vaccination skewing towards 
54  S1 and hybrid immunity evoking strong responses against both domains. The capacity for hybrid immunity 
55  to provide superior spike-directed ADCC was associated with selectively increased antibody responses 
56  against epitopes within both S1 and S2. Antibodies targeting both spike domains were important for 
57  strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation, with three regions of antibody reactivity outside the 
58  receptor-binding domain (RBD) corresponding with potent anti-spike ADCC. Consequently, ADCC induced 
59  by hybrid immunity with ancestral antigen was conserved against variants containing neutralisation 
60  escape mutations in the RBD [Delta and Omicron (BA.1)]. Induction of antibodies recognizing a broad 
61  range of spike epitopes and eliciting strong and durable ADCC may partially explain why hybrid immunity 
62  provides superior protection against infection and disease than vaccination alone, and demonstrates that 
63  spike-only subunit vaccines would benefit from strategies to induce a combination of S1- and S2-specific 
64  antibody responses.  
65  Significance 
66  Neutralising antibodies prevent the entry of cell-free virus, however, antibodies that promote Fc-
67  dependent activities such as ADCC are critical to control cell-associated virus. Although current SARS-CoV-
68  2 vaccines induce potent neutralising antibodies, they fail to induce robust ADCC. Our demonstration that 
69  hybrid immunity induces superior ADCC with pan-variant activity may partially explain why hybrid 
70  immunity offers enhanced protection against reinfection. It also highlights that vaccine strategies based 
71  on expression of the spike subunit alone should not focus solely on inducing antibody responses targeting 
72  the receptor binding domain.

74  Introduction 
75  Humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is induced by infection and by vaccination with 
76  any of the predominant COVID-19 vaccines used worldwide, most of which encode S as a single antigen 
77  (1-3). Anti-S antibodies (Ab) target multiple regions within the protein, but the major focus has been on 
78  those that neutralise cell-free virions. These primarily bind within the receptor binding domain (RBD) or 
79  in some cases the N-terminal domain (NTD), both of which are found in the S1 domain of the protein. 
80  Neutralising Abs block or prevent binding between SARS-CoV-2 and the entry receptor angiotensin 
81  converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) or prevent post-binding events required for virus entry (4, 5). They are 
82  thought to be crucial for reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus, are a key measure for predicting 
83  COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (6). 
84  Despite their clear importance, neutralising Abs have recognised limitations. The number of neutralising 
85  epitopes is limited, resulting in rapid selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations that weaken Ab 
86  binding to key neutralising sites (7, 8). After approximately 3 years of evolution in the human population, 
87  SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have largely escaped the neutralising activity of Abs induced by the 
88  ancestral S antigen and are continually evolving to evade Abs induced by infection with more recent 
89  variants. As a result, the efficacy of vaccines at preventing infection is already reduced within months of 
90  their introduction. Once infection occurs, SARS-CoV-2 can undergo direct cell-cell transmission, which 
91  further undermines the efficacy of neutralising Ab (9). 
92  To counteract cell-cell virus spread, Abs are required which, rather than neutralising cell-free virions, 
93  recognise viral antigens on the surface of infected cells (10). These recruit effector cells such as natural 
94  killer (NK) cells to kill infected cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), thereby 
95  controlling cell-associated virus. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 readily induces Ab capable of supporting ADCC 
96  (11) and ADCC is a key determinant of immunological control in animal challenge models (12-21). We and 
97  others have shown that Ab capable of ADCC are effective at preventing disease in animals even in the 
98  complete absence of neutralising activity (18, 22). Thus, inducing and maximising this activity through 
99  vaccination is highly desirable. 
100  In addition to being a target for neutralising Abs, SARS-CoV-2 S is also expressed on the infected cell 
101  surface, where it is efficiently bound by Abs (11). Thus, S has the potential to be an effective target for Fc 
102  receptor (FcR)-mediated NK cell activation, providing a single vaccine antigen capable of inducing Ab 
103  activity targeting both cell-free and cell-associated virus. Although studies have shown that vaccination

104  induces  anti-S  Abs capable  of  activating  NK  cells when  tested  against  purified  protein  (23-25)  or 
105  transfected cells (26-31), our previous study revealed that, when tested against live virus, effective ADCC 
106  was dominated by Abs targeting nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and ORF3a and individuals who had 
107  only anti-S Abs (i.e. vaccinees with no infection history) demonstrated weak ADCC (11). 
108  Subsequent studies have made it clear that infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination with a S-
109  encoding vaccine (‘hybrid’ immunity) offers superior protection compared to vaccination or infection 
110  alone (32-35). To explore Fc-dependent mechanisms that may contribute to this protection, we examined 
111  quantitative and qualitative aspects of S-induced humoral immunity and its association with ADCC 
112  potency in individuals who had recovered from infection, who had been vaccinated, or both. 
113  Results 
114  Hybrid immunity elicits robust ADCC against S-transduced cells 
115  As all donors in this study were vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 S-encoding vaccines, we isolated S-specific 
116  ADCC from responses targeting other SARS-CoV-2 proteins by testing Abs for their capacity to mediate 
117  lysis of SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing target cells. A series of plasma dilutions were performed initially to 
118  establish  optimal  levels  on  a  subset  of  samples  and  plasma  was  diluted  1:1000  for  subsequent 
119  experiments. This dilution distinguished ADCC from no ADCC for vaccinee and post-infection samples and 
120  discriminated ADCC levels from hybrid immunity across a wide range without plateauing. 
121  There was minimal background ADCC against parental (non-transduced) MRC-5 elicited by SARS-CoV-2 
122  seropositive plasma and against Wuhan-Hu-1 S-expressing MRC-5 (Wu-S-MRC-5) cells by pre-pandemic 
123  plasma (Figure 1a). Consistent with previous data (11), plasma from participants recovered from SARS-
124  CoV-2 infection mediated weak S-specific ADCC (mean 7.0% lysis) with Abs from only 13/31 individuals 
125  inducing > 10% lysis (Figure 1b). Responses were weaker amongst those who were vaccinated and not 
126  previously infected, with only one participant mediating ADCC > 10% after one vaccination (Figure 1b). A 
127  second vaccination increased responses with 10/40 individuals demonstrating killing above 10% specific 
128  lysis (Figure 1b). Nevertheless S-specific ADCC remained low overall, comparable overall to that of 
129  participants with infection-induced immunity (mean 7.7% lysis; Figure 1b). In contrast, hybrid immunity 
130  substantially enhanced ADCC (mean 31.3% lysis) with the absolute number of participants mediating > 
131  10% lysis increasing to 29/31 after a single vaccination (Figure 1b). There was no further increase to ADCC 
132  within the hybrid group upon second vaccination, however, one additional participant (30/31) mediated 
133  > 10% ADCC (Figure 1b).

134  Hybrid immunity induces significant S-specific ADCC against infected cells 
135  Although cells transfected or transduced to express S provide a platform to isolate S-specific ADCC, Ab-
136  dependent NK cell responses in the context of virus infection can differ significantly from that with cells 
137  overexpressing surface protein (11). As 51Cr release assays are incompatible with BSL3 conditions, we 
138  assessed Ab-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells by measuring NK cell 
139  degranulation (CD107a) as a surrogate for ADCC. 
140  During infection, ADNKA is dominated by Ab targeting antigens other than S, obscuring increases in S-
141  specific ADNKA attributed to vaccination (11). To circumvent this issue, we focused on individuals with 
142  asymptomatic or mild infection (and, therefore, comparatively weak pre-vaccine ADNKA responses) 
143  followed by vaccination with a S subunit vaccine, and tested sera over a range of dilutions. This allowed 
144  us to select a dilution at which infection-induced anti-N/M/ORF3a responses had faded, but where a 
145  significant boost to S-specific ADNKA could be measured following vaccination (Figure 1c) across multiple 
146  donors (Figure 1d). Although a second vaccine dose enhanced the abundance of ADNKA-capable Ab in 
147  some donors, such that reactivity was maintained at higher dilutions (Figure 1c), it did not alter maximal 
148  levels of ADNKA (Figure 1c, d). 
149  Therefore, anti-S Abs can mediate S-specific Ab-dependent NK cell activity against transduced or infected 
150  cells. However, these Abs are not efficiently induced by natural infection or vaccination – a hybrid 
151  combination is required. 
152  Neutralisation and ADNKA engage different Ab populations 
153  We next used infected cells to compare S-specific ADNKA responses mediated by hybrid immunity induced 
154  by mild or severe infection to determine whether S-specific ADNKA provided by hybrid immunity 
155  approached the level of ADNKA induced by the sum of Ab targeting all SARS-CoV-2 cell-surface proteins 
156  (i.e. including anti-N/M/ORF3a; Figure 2a) (11). Individuals were further stratified by the vaccine they 
157  received [adenovirus (AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S) or mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech)]. Vaccination alone induced 
158  weak ADNKA, irrespective of vaccine platform (Figure 2a, b). In contrast, hybrid immunity boosted S-
159  specific ADNKA to levels comparable to the potent multi-antigen ADNKA response of individuals who had 
160  recovered from mild infection, but not to the extent of those recovered from severe infection (Figure 2b). 
161  This pattern was in sharp contrast to the neutralising Ab response, where vaccination induced responses 
162  comparable to mild infection, and hybrid immunity gave responses comparable to severe infection (Figure 
163  2c).

164  To investigate further, we considered the correlation between neutralising and ADNKA Ab titres against 
165  live virus. Comparisons amongst vaccinated individuals in which ADNKA was primarily driven by anti-S 
166  responses demonstrated a positive correlation between neutralisation and ADNKA, along with a clear 
167  hierarchy of responses. Vaccination with adenovirus (AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S) demonstrated the weakest 
168  neutralisation and ADNKA activity, mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination induced better ADNKA and 
169  neutralisation than adenovirus vaccination, and both vaccination regimes were inferior to neutralisation 
170  and ADNKA induced by hybrid immunity (Figure 2d). Although neutralisation and ADNKA showed positive 
171  correlations in vaccinees and infected individuals (11), the relationship between the two activities was 
172  markedly different. For any given level of neutralisation, infection showed superior levels of ADNKA 
173  compared to vaccination (Figure 2e). Thus, in comparison to infection, S-based vaccines are effective at 
174  inducing neutralising Abs and less so at inducing ADNKA, consistent with the presence of Abs against 
175  multiple different ADCC targets following infection.  
176  Superior ADCC from hybrid immunity is not strictly explained by Ab abundance 
177  To test whether differences in ADCC between hybrid and vaccine-induced immunity were due in part to 
178  IgG abundance, we compared ADCC with measurements of total IgG targeting full length S (FLS) and 
179  individual S1 and S2 subunits. Comparisons were also carried out on IgG  subclass Ab; although IgG  is 
3 1
180  most abundant, IgG  supports more potent ADCC (36, 37). 
3
181  ADCC positively correlated with amounts of anti-S1 and S2 IgG (Figure 3a) and IgG (Figure 3b) Abs, despite 
3 
182  anti-S1 IgG  not being abundant in those recovered from infection (Figure 3b). As the hybrid group 
3
183  demonstrated more robust ADCC after first vaccination and there were no significant increases in the 
184  levels of Abs or ADCC after second vaccination (see below), we focused on responses elicited from the 
185  hybrid group after one vaccine to contrast with the vaccinees post second vaccination. In both the hybrid 
186  cohort (PV1) and the vaccine group (PV2), ADCC correlated with increased anti-FLS IgG Ab levels (Figure 
187  3c). This trend persisted when we compared anti-S1 IgG (Figure 3d) and anti-S2 IgG (Figure 3e) Ab levels 
188  with ADCC. There was also a significant correlation between levels of anti-FLS IgG  Ab and ADCC in both 
3
189  the hybrid and vaccine cohorts (Figure 3f), although this correlation was lost for the hybrid group when 
190  comparing reactivity against individual S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 3g, h). This may reflect 
191  that the lower abundance of IgG  results in IgG  having a greater influence on total ADCC activity. 
3 1
192  Despite these strong correlations between Ab levels and ADCC within cohorts, there were significant 
193  differences between the cohorts, with Abs from vaccinees eliciting much weaker ADCC for a given level of

194  Ab compared to their hybrid counterparts. Thus, although Ab levels influence ADCC activity, Ab abundance 
195  alone does not explain the superior ADCC induced by hybrid immunity. 
196  Vaccination, infection, and hybrid immunity induce distinct antibody responses to S1 and S2 
197  Since strong ADCC induced by hybrid immunity reflects the quality of immune response rather than simply 
198  abundance of IgG, we investigated the specificity of anti-S Abs following vaccination or hybrid immunity 
199  in more detail. Circulating IgG Abs against FLS and the individual S1 and S2 domains were measured by 
200  ELISA after infection, and after first and second vaccinations. Anti-FLS IgG Abs were detected (OD > 0.1) 
201  from 30/31 of the participants included in the hybrid cohort, and 38/40 of the vaccinated individuals 
202  (Figure 4a). Within the hybrid cohort, levels of anti-FLS Abs rose significantly after first vaccination, but 
203  there was no further increase upon second vaccination (Figure 4a). In contrast, Ab levels for the vaccinee 
204  cohort increased significantly following the second vaccination but remained relatively low (Figure 4a). 
205  Infection generated IgG Abs against both S1 and S2 domains, however, anti-S2 Ab responses were 
206  favoured over anti-S1 (Figure 4b). Vaccination after infection increased anti-S1 IgG Ab levels but had no 
207  significant impact on the levels of anti-S2 IgG Abs, indicating preferential boosting of anti-S1 Ab (Figure 
208  4b). Similar skewing towards anti-S1 responses following vaccination was also apparent amongst those 
209  vaccinated with no prior infection, as substantially higher levels of anti-S1 IgG Abs compared with anti-S2 
210  IgG Abs arose after both first and second vaccinations (Figure 4c). Thus, the anti-S IgG Ab response differs 
211  following infection or vaccination, with vaccination selectively inducing anti-S1 IgG Abs, while infection-
212  induced immunity promoted higher levels of anti-S2 IgG Abs. 
213  Infection history dictates anti-S2 IgG  antibody responses 
3
214  In addition to measuring the proportion of total IgG targeting S, we assessed the prevalence of IgG  Abs 
3
215  in persons with hybrid or vaccine-induced immunity. Anti-S1 IgG  Ab levels after infection were generally 
3
216  low, with only 4/31 participants having OD > 0.1 (Figure 4d), but levels increased after first vaccination 
217  with anti-S1 IgG  Abs detected in 11/31 participants (Figure 4d). In contrast, anti-S2 IgG  Ab levels were 
3 3
218  more substantial following infection, with 21/31 of participants having detectable anti-S2 IgG  Abs (Figure 
3
219  4d) and vaccination further improved anti-S2 IgG  Ab levels (Figure 4d). With hybrid immunity, levels of 
3
220  anti-S2 IgG  Abs were significantly higher than anti-S1 IgG  Abs and remained stable up to ~5 months. 
3 3
221  Vaccination alone resulted in 28/40 individuals producing anti-S1 IgG  Abs after first vaccination and 31/40 
3
222  after second vaccination (Figure 4e). One vaccination induced low amounts of anti-S2 IgG  Abs in 16/40

224  Abs (Figure 4e). Compared with hybrid immunity, levels of anti-S1 IgG  Abs outweighed anti-S2 IgG  
3 3
225  following a single vaccination, with levels similar following two vaccinations (Figure 4e). Therefore, for 
226  both total IgG and IgG , infection-induced immunity favoured anti-S2 Ab production, whereas vaccination 
3
227  induced more robust anti-S1 Ab levels (Figure 4f, g). The strongest IgG Ab responses against both S1 and 
228  S2 were seen following hybrid immunity. 
229  ADCC potency depends on antibodies reactive against both S1 and S2 
230  To determine whether Abs targeting either or both of the S1 and S2 domains were responsible for potent 
231  S-specific ADCC following hybrid immunity, we selectively depleted Abs that target different S domains 
232  and assessed ADNKA against infected cells. ADNKA induced by vaccinee serum was too low to observe 
233  clear effects following depletion so we focussed solely on donors with hybrid immunity. Using two donors, 
234  we depleted Abs targeting the entire S trimer, the S1 domain, the S2 domain, or specific NTD or RBD 
235  domains found within S1. Serums were pre-diluted such that the starting dilution was sufficient to have 
236  diluted out Abs targeting antigens other than S (Figure 1c). Although depleting Abs targeting NTD or RBD 
237  alone led to only minor reductions in ADNKA, complete S1 or S2 subunit Ab depletion led to significant 
238  reductions in both donors (Figure 5a, b), indicating that a combination of Abs targeting S1 and S2 is 
239  required for robust ADNKA. 
240  Depleting Abs targeting NTD or RBD yielded smaller reductions in ADNKA than depleting Abs targeting the 
241  entire S1 domain. The reagents used for NTD and RBD depletion targeted amino acids 16-318 and 319-
242  541, respectively, while the S1 depletion targeted amino acids 16-685. As the S1 depletion potentially 
243  removed Abs that targeted 542-685, which were not depleted by RBD or NTD depletion, we repeated this 
244  experiment and included a double depletion of both NTD and RBD (Figure 5c, d). The RBD/NTD double 
245  depletion closely mirrored S1 depletion. Combined data from five donors indicated that potent ADNKA 
246  induced by hybrid immunity was dependent on the presence of Abs reactive to both the S1 and S2 regions, 
247  as depletion of either region led to a significant loss in ADNKA (Figure 5e). 
248  Antibody reactivity against three determinants along S correlates with potent ADCC 
249  Having determined that Abs against both S1 and S2 subunits were important for eliciting strong S-specific 
250  ADCC, we investigated the fine specificity of Ab responses arising from hybrid immunity by ELISA-based 
251  peptide scanning. 181 overlapping peptides were coated onto ELISA plates in sequential pairs and IgG Ab 
252  reactivity was measured. A comparison of Abs reactive to linear regions contained in both S1 and S2 
253  produced after infection (Figure 6a, blue line) and subsequent vaccination (Figure 6a, orange line)

254  revealed differential patterns and robustness of Ab reactivity. A heatmap illustrating changing patterns of 
255  linear Ab epitope reactivity along S before and after vaccination is depicted for 7 participants in the hybrid 
256  group (Figure 6b). 
257  Samples obtained after infection alone had Abs recognising fewer S1 and S2 epitopes than matched 
258  samples following vaccination (Figure 6b), with Ab reactivity against three distinct regions along S 
259  particularly enriched amongst the hybrid samples  (Figure 6b). These three areas of reactivity are 
260  contained within the (i) C-terminal domain (CTD) 1 and (ii) CTD2 of S1 and (iii) a region in S2 immediately 
261  upstream of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) sequence in the connector domain (CD; Figure 6b). Besides the 
262  early arising and common D614G mutation, these regions showed no genetic variation between Delta or 
263  Omicron variants (Figure 6b). 
264  To illustrate potential associations between ADCC and Ab reactivity against these three regions, we used 
265  data collected from two persons with infection-induced immunity and subsequent vaccination to depict 
266  the relationship between ADCC and the magnitude of anti-IgG Ab found in CTD1/2 and CD. In both cases, 
267  increasing anti-IgG Ab levels specific for each of the three regions paralleled robust increases in ADCC 
268  (Figure 6c). Further, there were significant associations between ADCC and both the number of ADCC 
269  determinants to which a participant demonstrated IgG Ab reactivity (Figure 6d) and the cumulative OD 
270  from the three distinct regions (Figure 6e). Thus, epitope specificity plays a key role in S-specific killing of 
271  SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. 
272  Hybrid immunity broadly mediates ADCC across variant strains 
273  Virus evolution in human populations results in selection of viral variants mutated at key residues for 
274  neutralising Ab binding – primarily within the RBD, but also within the NTD (7, 8). However, ADCC-
275  susceptible determinants are distributed much more broadly across S (Figure 5) and ADCC determinants 
276  revealed by peptide scanning do not overlap with mutations in recent virus variants such as Delta and 
277  Omicron (Figure 6b). This suggests ADCC induced by hybrid immunity may be better preserved than 
278  neutralisation across variant strains. To assess S-specific Ab-dependent responses against variant strains, 
279  MRC-5 cells were transduced to express Delta or Omicron S at levels equivalent to Wu-S-MRC-5 (Figure 
280  7a). When used in ADCC assays, Abs produced after hybrid infection elicited comparable levels of ADCC 
281  against target cells expressing Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta S (Figure 7b).  Although ADCC was reduced against 
282  Omicron S-expressing cells, the relative reduction was mild (12.9% decrease), and 5/16 participants

283  mediated equivalent levels of ADCC against cells expressing Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta and Omicron S (Figure 
284  7b). 
285  A subset of vaccinees mediating detectable ADCC against Wu-S-MRC-5 were similarly tested. Here, the 
286  decline in ADCC against cells expressing Omicron S was more pronounced with a 35.5% relative reduction 
287  (Figure 7c). Ab from only 1/14 vaccinees mediated comparable levels of ADCC against wild type and 
288  variant strains (Figure 7c), consistent with Ab in these donors being focussed on the S1 domain, which is 
289  more heavily mutated in these virus variants. 
290  To ensure that these results were comparable to an infection setting, we assessed neutralisation and 
291  ADCC against replicating virus using either ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 or Omicron strains. Consistent with 
292  published data, we observed that Omicron was more resistant to neutralisation following vaccination, and 
293  despite this decrease in neutralisation being less severe following hybrid immunity compared with 
294  vaccination, a significant loss was observed (Figure 7d). In contrast, and in agreement with data obtained 
295  using cells overexpressing S, we measured only a small decline in ADNKA against Omicron-infected cells 
296  (Figure 7e). Thus, by targeting a broader range of epitopes, including those more conserved across 
297  variants, ADCC resists virus escape due to virus mutation more effectively than neutralisation. 
298  Discussion 
299  Strong and durable immune responses are desirable to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control severity 
300  of infection. Neutralising Ab activity has dominated as a surrogate measure of protection, however, 
301  protection against severe illness without robust neutralisation suggests that other aspects of immunity, 
302  including T cells and NK cells, play a role (38). The ability of T cells and NK cells to limit illness by eliminating 
303  infected host cells once infection does occur underlies the importance of considering their recruitment in 
304  vaccination strategies, especially if their activity is better conserved across variants than Ab neutralisation 
305  (39, 40). 
306  Associations between ADCC and viral control in animal models (12-22) indicate that it is an important 
307  component of immunological protection. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces Abs against N/M/ORF3a that 
308  dominate NK cell activation by infected cells (11), however, in the absence of vaccines encoding 
309  alternative ADCC antigens, it is important to understand the capacity for S-specific ADCC. Infection or 
310  vaccination alone was insufficient to induce potent S-directed ADCC, whether assessed by direct killing of 
311  S-expressing cells or NK cell activation against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. However, the strong ADCC

312  observed with hybrid immunity indicates that it is possible to generate robust and lasting ADCC through 
313  S-targeted Ab responses. 
314  Previous analysis of hybrid immunity in the context of neutralising Abs demonstrated that compared to 
315  vaccination alone, it results in more memory B-cells and circulating Abs, the latter of which was affirmed 
316  in our study (41, 42). This increase in circulating IgG enhances neutralisation of more immune-evasive 
317  virus variants (41, 43, 44), while at the clonal level, it also reflects selection of Abs with higher neutralising 
318  potency (45). In the case of ADCC, neither increased abundance, nor differences in IgG subclass could 
319  explain superior hybrid immunity-induced ADCC. Instead, qualitative aspects of the Ab profile played a 
320  more significant role. Robust levels of Abs targeting numerous epitopes in both S1 and S2 were a 
321  consistent feature of hybrid immunity. 
322  The S1 domain of spike contains the NTD and RBD domains, which are required for receptor binding and 
323  are dominant targets for neutralising Abs. As a result, vaccine development has focussed heavily on 
324  inducing S1-targeted Abs, including the testing of RBD subunit vaccines (46-50). However, due to 
325  mutations selected in S1 that tend to reduce neutralisation, there is increasing interest in neutralising Abs 
326  targeting the more conserved S2 domain (51). Studies in mice demonstrated that S2-specific vaccination 
327  effectively induces cross-variant neutralisation (51). Our work now extends this by showing that strategies 
328  to induce both S1 and S2 responses will also serve to boost ADCC. The polyspecific (i.e. S1 and S2) nature 
329  of S-directed ADCC improves targeting of virus variants with heavily mutated S1 and may limit the ability 
330  of viruses to evade this arm of host defense. With a wider range of Abs recognizing epitopes distributed 
331  throughout S, the loss of any single epitope may not substantially impact ADCC, raising the barrier for 
332  selection of escape mutants. 
333  The S gene of seasonal human beta coronaviruses (HCoV HKU1, HCoV OC43) is divergent from SARS-CoV-
334  2, sharing only ~ 36% overall homology, with S2 somewhat more conserved than the S1 domain. The 
335  preferential Ab targeting of S2 epitopes after infection may be partly attributed to a heterologous boost 
336  towards cross-reactive S2-specific memory B cells (52-54), with pre-existing cross-reactive HCoV memory 
337  B cells activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection kick-starting production of anti-S2 Abs. Interestingly, the 
338  same regions we revealed as key regions of Ab reactivity corresponding with potent ADCC were previously 
339  demonstrated to be elicited by heterologous anti-S Ab responses (54). This raises the question as to 
340  whether immunodominant regions within S1 and S2 conserved between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 
341  selectively targeted for Ab reactivity and avidity to support robust ADCC. If SARS-CoV-2 infection induces 
342  cross-reactive HCoV anti-S2 Ab production, it is unclear why vaccination did not have a similar effect.

343  Prolonged antigen exposure from high viral loads, the presence of inflammatory stimuli during virus 
344  infection, the way S traffics to and is presented on the infected cell surface, or differential sites of antigen 
345  presentation (e.g. intramuscular for the vaccine, respiratory for the virus), may all contribute to diverse 
346  outcomes from exposure through infection versus S subunit vaccination. It will be interesting whether 
347  switching vaccine delivery from intra-muscular to intranasal, to promote mucosal immunity, impacts this 
348  process (55, 56). 
349  This study focussed on individuals who were infected prior to vaccination. Many individuals have now 
350  been infected after being vaccinated with ancestral S antigen and it is unclear how these breakthrough 
351  infections will affect ADCC against emerging variants. Our previous research demonstrated that infection 
352  induces non-S ADCC responses that target N/M/ORF3a (11). However, as vaccination reduces the 
353  induction of non-S (e.g. nucleocapsid) Ab during breakthrough infection, presumably due to enhanced 
354  vaccine-mediated immunological control (57-59), breakthrough infections may fail to induce potent 
355  N/M/ORF3a-mediated ADCC. In this case, strong S-directed ADCC induced by hybrid immunity would 
356  become an important effector mechanism contributing to protection and an important consideration for 
357  future research. 
358  In summary, our data reveal that hybrid immunity establishes conditions whereby Abs generated against 
359  key determinants within S1 and S2 domains elicit ADCC quantitatively superior to vaccination or infection 
360  alone. In addition, hybrid immunity induced by ancestral antigen engenders an Ab response that retains 
361  activity against variant strains to a far greater extent than neutralisation. Given the complementary roles 
362  of neutralisation and ADCC in controlling cell-free and cell-associated virus, respectively, both Fc- and Fab 
363  V-region mediated effector functions are desirable for incorporation into vaccine strategies. Strong ADCC 
364  may play a part in the protection offered by hybrid immunity, uncovers a novel role for S2-targeted Abs, 
365  and suggests that vaccine strategies based on spike expression would benefit from inducing Abs targeted 
366  broadly across spike, as opposed to just RBD. 
367  Methods

369  This study was carried out at two sites. In Canada, the study conformed to recommendations of the 
370  Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and ethical 
371  approval was given by the Health Research Ethics Authority of Newfoundland and Labrador (HREB).

373  questionnaire addressing previous testing history and reasons for suspecting infection with SARS-CoV-2 
374  was administered at study intake after written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of 
375  Helsinki. Thirty-one individuals with confirmed infection who continued in the study and received 2 doses 
376  of a COVID-19 vaccine were matched with 40 individuals with no previous infection history who had 
377  received 2 doses of a COVID 19-vaccine (Table 1). Asymptomatic participants were identified through 
378  Public Health surveillance and contact tracing after contact with RT-PCR-confirmed cases or through 
379  serological testing for anti-S and anti-N protein IgG Abs (60). Most participants enrolled following the first 
380  wave  of  COVID-19  and  infections  were  attributed  to  ancestral  Wuhan-Hu-1  SARS-CoV-2.  Three 
381  participants had infections attributed to B.1.1.7. Participants self-declared any medical treatments they 
382  were receiving as well as information on comorbidity. Persons with any known underlying immune 
383  compromising condition or on immunosuppressive treatment were excluded. 
384  In the UK, ethical approval was given by Local Research Ethics Committee or the Avon Longitudinal Study 
385  of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) Ethics and Law Committee. Peripheral blood was collected 2-4 weeks 
386  after  a  RT-PCR  or  LFD  confirmed  infection,  or  after  vaccination,  from  otherwise  healthy  donors. 
387  Alternatively, serum samples submitted as part of the ALSPAC cohort (61-63) were assessed based on 
388  serology for N and S, to identify individuals who had submitted samples after an initial infection, followed 
389  by samples after each vaccination. In total 18 individuals who were infected prior to vaccination were 
390  matched with 18 individuals who had received two doses of vaccines with no experience of prior infection. 
391  Results were also compared to samples from a previously described cohort of individuals who had 
392  experienced mild or severe COVID-19 and had not been vaccinated (11). 
393  Blood sample processing 
394  Whole blood was collected by venipuncture in acid citrate dextrose vacutainers, after which plasma was 
395  collected following 10 min centrifugation at 500g and stored at -80°C (Canada). Alternatively, whole blood 
396  was collected in a serum-separating vacutainer and serum collected following centrifugation at 500g for 
397  10 min (UK). PBMC used for ADCC experiments were isolated from anti-coagulated heparinized blood 
398  from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using the Canadian Autoimmunity Standardization 
399  Core consensus standard operating procedure (version: March 21, 2019). Freshly isolated PBMC were 
400  resuspended in lymphocyte medium consisting of RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS (HyClone™), 200 IU/mL 
401  penicillin/streptomycin,  0.01  M  HEPES,  1%  L-glutamine  (all  from  Invitrogen)  and  2  x  10-5  M  2-
402  mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and used directly in functional experiments.

403  Cell lines and viruses 
404  All cell lines and PBMC were cultured with 5% CO  at 37°C. VeroE6 cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 
2
405  (VAT) and A549 cells expressing ACE2 (AA) were a gift from the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus 
406  Research (64). Human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells were obtained from ATCC® (CCL-171™) and Lenti-X™ 
407  293T cells were obtained from TakaRa (Mountain View CA, USA). All were propagated in complete DMEM 
408  (Sigma-Aldrich)  containing  10%  FBS (HyClone™)  and  200  IU/mL  penicillin/streptomycin  (Invitrogen, 
409  Carlsbad CA, USA). Ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from a BAC containing the complete genome of 
410  a strain that matches the original Wuhan-Hu-1 (64) and the Omicron (BA.1) variant was a gift from 
411  Professor Arvind Patel (from the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research). Both were propagated 
412  in VAT cells. Virions were concentrated and purified by pelleting through a 30% sucrose cushion and 
413  titrated by plaque assay in AA cells as previously described (11). All virus seed stocks were verified by 
414  whole-genome sequencing on the Illumina platform. 
415  Spike gene transfer and expression in MRC-5 cells 
416  The recombinant Lenti-X™ pLVX-IRES lentiviral vector expression system (TakaRa) was used to introduce 
417  Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron (BA.1) S sequences into the MRC-5 cell line. The Wuhan-Hu-1 
418  S was obtained from BEI Resources in a pcDNA™3.1(-) mammalian expression vector (NR-52420; NIAID, 
419  NIH)  (65). Delta  S was  synthesised  by  Invitrogen GeneArt (Thermo  Fisher Scientific)  and  contains 
420  mutations: T19R, T95I, G142D, E156G, E157- F158- R450L, K476T, G612D, R679P, N948D. Omicron S was 
421  obtained from BEI Resources in a pCMV/R mammalian expression vector (NR-56470; NIAID, NIH) with the 
422  following mutations: A67V, H69-, V70-, T95I, G142-, V143-, Y144-, Y145D, N211-, L212I, "EPE" insertion 
423  between 214R and 215D, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, 
424  Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, 
425  Q954H, N969K, L981F. 
426  Constructs were inserted into pLVX-IRES as detailed in (66) using conventional cloning protocols and all 
427  constructs were verified by forward and reverse strand sequencing (TCAG Facilities, Hospital for Sick 
428  Children, Toronto ON, Canada) to ensure authenticity. SnapGene Software (San Diego CA, USA) was used 
429  for  designing  and  visualizing  cloning  procedures,  designing  and  aligning  sequencing  primers  and 
430  comparing variant sequences to wild-type Wuhan-Hu-1. Transduced cells were propagated and selected 
431  in  complete DMEM  containing  1 μg/mL  puromycin  (Sigma-Aldrich). Extracellular  S expression  was 
432  confirmed by flow cytometry, as previously outlined (66).

433  Antibody-dependent cell-mediated killing assays 
434  PBMC were freshly processed, resuspended in lymphocyte medium and kept at 37°C and 5% CO  until 
2
435  use. For ADCC assays using Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta or Omicron S-expressing MRC-5 target cells, 104 cells/well 
436  were plated and labelled with 1 μCi Na 51CrO /well (PerkinElmer, Akron, OH, USA) overnight in 96-well 
2 4
437  round bottom plates and then washed four times in PBS containing 1% FBS (HyClone™). PBMC (E:T 25:1) 
438  and heat-inactivated plasma (56°C for 1h) were added to wells with a final volume of 300 μL and final 
439  plasma dilution of 1:1000 and cytotoxic activity measured by 51Cr release over 5 h. 51Cr release was 
440  measured in 125 μL of supernatant on a Wallac 1480 Wizard gamma counter and percent specific lysis 
441  calculated  by  (experimental  51Cr  release  –  spontaneous  51Cr  release)  /  (maximum  51Cr  release  – 
442  spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100. 
443  Assays using virus-infected cells used CD107a degranulation ADNKA as a proxy for ADCC to be in 
444  compliance with BLS3 containment and were carried out as previously described (11). Briefly, AA cells 
445  were infected at MOI = 5 for 24 h prior to being detached with TrypLE™ (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA 
446  USA), then 25,000 targets mixed with 250,000 PBMC, serum, and anti-CD107a-FITC (BioLegend, London, 
447  UK) and GolgiStop (BD, Swindon, UK) in a total volume of 100 μL for 5 h. PBMC were stained with live/dead 
448  fixable  aqua  (Thermo  Fisher),  anti-CD3-PE-Cy7  (UCHT1,  BioLegend),  anti-CD56-BV605  (5.1H11, 
449  BioLegend), and anti-CD57-APC (HNK-1, BioLegend). Data were acquired and analysed using an Attune 
450  NXT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher) and expressed as the percentage of live CD107a+ CD57+ NK (CD3-
451  CD56+) cells. All sera were tested against mock-infected cells to ensure there was no background NK cell 
452  activation and any sera demonstrating background activation were excluded. A seronegative serum was 
453  included in all assays as a negative control. To enable comparisons with previous datasets, and to minimise 
454  inter-experiment variability, a donor serum demonstrating moderate ADNKA was included as a positive 
455  control in every assay. Sera were tested at a range of dilutions, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 
456  calculated using GraphPad Prism 9. This value was then normalised to the AUC for the standard serum in 
457  each assay. 
458  Virus neutralisation assay 
459  Assays were carried out as previously described (11). Briefly, 600 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 was 
460  incubated with appropriate dilutions of serum, in duplicate, for 1 h at 37°C. The mixes were then added 
461  to pre-plated VeroE6 cells for 48 h. After this time, monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
462  (Thermo Fisher), permeabilised for 15 min with 0.5% NP-40 (Merck Life Science, Dorset, UK) then blocked 
463  for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) and 3% non-fat milk. Primary Ab (anti-N 1C7, Stratech, 1:500

465  washing  in  PBST,  secondary  Ab  (anti-mouse  IgG-HRP, Pierce,  1:3000  dilution)  was  added  in  PBST 
466  containing 1% non-fat milk and incubated for 1 h. Monolayers were washed again, developed using 
467  Sigmafast™ OPD (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturers’ instructions, and read on a Clariostar Omega 
468  plate reader (OD 450 nm). Wells containing no virus, virus but no Ab, and a standardized serum displaying 
469  moderate activity were included as controls in every experiment. NT50 were calculated in GraphPad Prism 
470  9. 
471  Serological testing 
472  Plasma was diluted in PBS containing 0.05% TWEEN® 20 (0.05% PBST; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 
473  and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) then tested against recombinant proteins coated in 
474  Dulbecco’s  PBS  (DPBS,  Sigma-Aldrich)  overnight  onto  96-well  Immunlon-2  plates  (VWR  Scientific, 
475  Mississauga, ON, Canada). Recombinant protein antigens included SARS-CoV-2 FLS glycoprotein trimer 
476  [50 ng/well; SMT1-1 reference material, National Research Council (NRC), Canada], the S1 subunit of 
477  SARS-CoV-2 S (65 ng/well; SinoBiological, Wayne, PA, USA) and S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S (50 ng/well; 
478  SinoBiological). The predicted molecular mass for S1 and S2 were 76.5 kDa and 59.4 kDa, respectively, and 
479  coating amounts were determined to account for this difference. Plates were washed 4 times with 0.05% 
480  PBST, blocked for 1 h with 200 μL of PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), washed 4 times then 100 
481  μL/well of diluted plasma (1:500 for FLS IgG or 1:100 for S1 and S2 IgG and IgG ) was applied to antigen-

482  coated plates in duplicate wells for 1.5 h. Total IgG was measured following 6 washes and a 1-h incubation 
483  with 100 μL/well of 1:50,000 HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 
484  Labs, West Grove, PA, USA). IgG  was measured following 6 washes and a 1-h incubation with 100 μL/well

492  Depletions of specific Abs from sera were carried out as previously described (11). In brief, Abs targeting 
493  different domains of S were depleted using magnetic bead conjugated proteins based on either the RBD,

496  Mixtures were incubated on a rotating mixer at 4 °C overnight. Serum diluted in buffer alone was used as 
497  a control. Magnetic beads were then removed using a 3D printed magnetic stand then a second round of 
498  depletion carried out using fresh beads as indicated. All values in assays were corrected for dilutions.

500  Individual overlapping peptides (17- or 13-mers, with 10 amino acid overlaps) spanning the canonical 
501  Wuhan-Hu-1 S sequence (NR-52402; BEI Resources) were reconstituted at 10 mg/mL in DMSO (Sigma-
502  Aldrich) then diluted to 50 μg/mL in DPBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at -20°C. 125 ng/well of each S 
503  peptide 2 – 181 (BEI Resources) was coated overnight on Immunlon-2 plates (VWR Scientific) in sequential 
504  pairs (e.g. 2 & 3… 180 & 181). Full length S trimer (SMT1-1, NRC) was diluted in DPBS and coated overnight 
505  at 150 ng/well as positive control. Plates were washed four times with 0.05% PBST and blocked for 1 h 
506  with 200 μL/well PBS + 1% BSA. Plasma was diluted 1:50 in 0.05% PBST + 0.1% BSA and 50 μL was applied 
507  for 1.5 h. Plates were washed six times and total IgG binding was measured in a 1-h incubation with 100 
508  μL/well of 1:50,000 HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) and

511  Statistical analysis 
512  Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 with two-sided P-values < 0.05 considered 
513  significant.  Normality  of  data  distributions  were  assessed  using  Shapiro-Wilk  test.  Significance  in 
514  correlations were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Differences in means with 
515  standard deviation (SD) or medians with interquartile range (IQR, calculated as IQR = Q  − Q ) between 
3 1
516  groups were compared by using one-way ANOVA, Student’s t-test, Friedman test or Mann-Whitney U-test 
517  as appropriate based on normality of data distribution.

688  Figure  1|  Vaccine-,  infection-,  and  hybrid  immunity-elicited  S-specific  NK  cell  activation. 
689  Background NK cell lysis of (a) non-transduced (open black circle) or Wuhan-Hu-1 S-expressing (red 
690  square) MRC-5 cells elicited by plasma from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive (n = 10) or plasma collected pre 
691  pandemic (n = 8), respectively, was measured by 51Cr release (E:T 25:1). (b) Sequential measures of S-
692  MRC-5 cell ADCC elicited by plasma collected after infection then subsequent vaccination or after 
693  vaccination alone was measured by 51Cr release (E:T 25:1). Experiments were performed in duplicate with 
694  three independent donors and a representative plot shown. (c, d) Serum samples were serially diluted 
695  and  CD57+  NK  cell  CD107a  degranulation  against A549-ACE2  cells  infected with  SARS-CoV-2 24  h 
696  previously at MOI = 5 was measured by flow cytometry. Data from a single individual is shown in (c) and 
697  compiled data from multiple donors in (d) was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). 
698  Black lines bisecting groups in (a) represent the mean of individual plasma samples with standard 
699  deviation, and in (b) represent median with IQR. P value in (b) was calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test 
700  with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test and in (d) calculated using one-way ANOVA for matched data with 
701  Tukey’s correction and shown above horizontal lines spanning comparison groups when significant. The 
702  probability of hybrid immunity inducing more robust ADCC than vaccine-induced immunity was calculated 
703  using two-sided Fisher’s exact test. 
704  Figure 2| Spike-directed ADNKA against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A549-ACE2 cells were infected 
705  with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 h and CD57+ NK cell CD107a expression measured in response to serial dilutions 
706  of sera from vaccinees (PV2), hybrid immunity (PV2) or persons recovered from mild or severe infection 
707  and no vaccination. Representative data in (a) is depicted at the indicated dilutions and (b) the AUC was 
708  calculated, and data compiled for multiple donors (vaccinee n = 18; hybrid immunity n = 18; mild infection 
709  n = 18; severe infection n =  14). (c) Sera used in (b) were applied to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, 
710  neutralisation assessed and NT50 calculated. (d, e) The significance of correlations between ADNKA and

718  Figure 4| Anti-S1/S2 Ab responses after vaccination, infection, and hybrid immunity. Circulating 
719  anti-FLS IgG Abs from (a) participants with hybrid immunity were measured post infection (PI; blue circle) 
720  and after first (PV1; red chevron) and second (PV2; green square) vaccinations, and from vaccinated 
721  participants (n = 40) PV1 (purple triangle) and PV2 (orange diamond). Levels of anti-S1 IgG (open black 
722  circle) and anti-S2 IgG (red square) in samples obtained from (b) participants with hybrid immunity were 
723  compared PI, PV1 and PV2, and from (c) vaccinees were compared PV1 and PV2. Relative amounts of anti-
724  S1 and anti-S2 IgG  were measured for (d) persons with hybrid immunity or (e) vaccinees and anti-S1 and 
3
725  anti-S2 IgG  Ab levels compared. Hybrid- and vaccine-induced anti-S1 and anti-S2 (f) IgG and (g) IgG  were 
3 3
726  contrasted. P values in (a) were calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons 
727  test; (b) – (e) using Friedman’s test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test; (f), (g) using Kruskal-Wallis test 
728  with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test and are shown above horizontal lines spanning comparison groups 
729  when significant. Lines bisecting groups represent median with IQR. 
730  Figure 5| Assessment of ADNKA after S subunit Ab depletion. Sera from individuals with hybrid 
731  immunity were diluted 1:9 then Abs targeting the indicated domains of S were depleted using magnetic 
732  bead-conjugated protein. These depleted serums were then used to measure CD57+ NK cell CD107a 
733  expression at the indicated dilutions in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-ACE2. Four individuals 
734  are depicted in (a) – (d). (e) The AUC for each sample in (a) – (d) was calculated then the amount of ADNKA

736  from which all S Abs had been depleted, was determined (n = 5). 
737  Figure 6| Peptide scanning to identify distinct linear regions associated with robust ADCC. 
738  Linear FLS Ab epitope reactivity was determined by ELISA-based peptide scanning. (a) A representative 
739  depiction of anti-IgG Ab reactive to linear segments is illustrated by an overlaid line graph. The blue line 
740  represents OD results of the full S peptide scan of a sample collected from one participant recovered from 
741  moderate COVID-19 infection and the orange overlay represents a sample from the same participant 
742  collected 1 month after their first vaccination. (b) Compiled peptide scan data from samples collected 
743  from 7 participants post infection (PI) and after hybrid immunity (H) were illustrated using a heat map and 
744  aligned with known mutations in Delta and Omicron sequences. Three determinants associated with ADCC 
745  are identified by asterisks. (c) The left axis depicts anti-S1 CDT1/2 (triangle), S1 CTD2 (circle) and S2 CD 
746  (square) IgG Ab OD and compares these levels with ADCC (right axis) for two participants after infection 
747  (open black bar) and after subsequent vaccination (open red bar). Participant IgG Ab OD collected from
