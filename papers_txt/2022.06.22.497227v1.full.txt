35  ABSTRACT 
36  Muscle weakness and atrophy are clinical hallmarks of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). 
37  Muscle stem cells, which contribute to skeletal muscle growth and repair, are also affected 
38  in this disease. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this defective activity and 
39  the impact on the disease severity are still elusive. Here, we explored through an unbiased 
40  approach the molecular signature leading to myogenic cell defects in DM1. Single cell 
41  RNAseq data revealed the presence of a specific subset of DM1 myogenic cells expressing 
42  a  senescence  signature,  characterized  by  the  high  expression  of  genes  related  to 
43  senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This profile was confirmed using 
44  different senescence markers in vitro and in situ. Accumulation of intranuclear RNA foci 
45  in senescent cells, suggest that RNA-mediated toxicity contribute to senescence induction. 
46  High expression of IL-6, a prominent SASP cytokine, in the serum of DM1 patients was 
47  identified  as  a  biomarker  correlating  with  muscle  weakness  and  functional  capacity 
48  limitations. Drug screening revealed that the BCL-XL inhibitor (A1155463), a senolytic 
49  drug, can specifically target senescent DM1 myoblasts to induce their apoptosis and reduce 
50  their SASP. Removal of senescent cells re-established the myogenic function of the non-
51  senescent DM1 myoblasts, which displayed improved proliferation and differentiation 
52  capacity in vitro; and enhanced engraftment following transplantation in vivo. Altogether 
53  this study presents a well-defined senescent molecular signature in DM1 untangling part 
54  of the pathological mechanisms observed in the disease; additionally, we demonstrate the 
55  therapeutic  potential  of  targeting  these  defective  cells  with  senolytics  to  restore 
56  myogenesis.

58  INTRODUCTION 
59  Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare disease that affects approximately 1:8,000 
60  individuals in the world1,2. DM1 is caused by an unstable (CTG) nucleotide repeat in the 
61  dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene3. CTG repeats in DNA lead to toxic 
62  mRNA  accumulation  causing  splicing  defects  mainly  attributable  to  binding  protein 
63  sequestration. In healthy individuals, the DMPK alleles have 5 to 37 CTG repeats, but in 
64  DM1, there can be hundreds to thousands of these repeats; with the number of repeats 
65  partially correlating with the age of onset and the severity of the disease4-7. Patients are 
66  classified into five clinical phenotypes according to the CTG expansion size, and the 
67  occurrence and onset of their main symptoms: congenital, infantile, juvenile, adult and late-
68  onset8. 
69   
70  DM1 is a multisystemic disease that affects different organs, and particularly the skeletal 
71  muscles, leading to progressive weakness and atrophy9. Muscle stem cells (MuSC), which 
72  contribute to skeletal muscle growth and repair are also affected in this disease5. In healthy 
73  condition, quiescent MuSC are activated after an injury and become myoblasts that 
74  proliferate extensively before exiting cell cycle to self-renew or to differentiate and fuse to 
75  form new myofibers10. Previous studies performed on mixed cell populations (non-purified 
76  by FACS) extracted from skeletal muscle samples of DM1 patients showed that these cells 
77  exhibit signs of cellular senescence (a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest), such as 
78  enzymatic senescence-associated b-Galactosidase (SA-b-Gal) activity, expression of the 
79  cell cycle inhibitor p16, loss of nuclear integrity, and nuclear envelope invagination11,12. It 
80  was shown using in vitro models of DM1 that cellular senescence is independent from

81  telomere shortening but is rather induced by the activity of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 
82  and/or p21 in response to CTG-related stress12-14. This increase in cellular senescence is 
83  associated  with  reduced  proliferative  capacity  of  DM1  myoblasts  and  delayed 
84  differentiation and fusion into myofibers5,12,14. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 
85  4 (Cdk4) to bypass p16-induced senescence restored the proliferation of DM1 cells to the 
86  level of healthy control cells12. 
87   
88  In addition to decreasing the pool of competent cells, senescent cells secrete a broad range 
89  of molecules including proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) and matrix proteinases 
90  (e.g., MMP1, MMP3). This cocktail, known as the Senescence-Associated Secretory 
91  Phenotype (SASP), alters the microenvironment and leads to detrimental changes in 
92  neighbouring cells and in the whole organism15,16. Particularly, IL-6 is associated with 
93  muscle wasting conditions and promote the exhaustion of the MuSC pool17-19. Chronic 
94  exposure to SASP is considered as one of the major sources of deleterious effects on tissue 
95  maintenance and regenerative capacity15,20; however, its impact on DM1 pathogenesis has 
96  not been investigated yet.  
97     
98  Considering that senescent cells accumulate with time and have detrimental impacts on 
99  neighbouring cells, they represent an attractive target for the treatment of many disorders21. 
100  Pioneer studies showed that genetic removal of senescent cells expressing the cell cycle 
101  inhibitor  p16  in  aging  mice  enhances  their  lifespan20,22.  Moreover,  pharmacological 
102  compounds, called senolytics, can selectively eliminate senescent cells23, which reduces 
103  the production of frailty-related proinflammatory cytokines in aged mice, and improves

104  physical function and lifespan24. Considering that DM1 has been described as a progeroid 
105  syndrome (i.e. mimicking premature aging)25, and that skeletal muscles in DM1 share 
106  many similarities with aged muscles such as cellular senescence, MuSC defects, and 
107  muscle  wasting26,  it  suggests  that  senolytics  hold  great  therapeutic  potential  for  the 
108  treatment of DM1. However, the impact of senolytics in muscular diseases such as DM1 
109  has never been investigated. 
110   
111  Here,  we  generated  the  first  single-cell  transcriptomic  atlas  of  DM1  to  identify  the 
112  molecular signature of myogenic cell subpopulations. Using myoblasts isolated from DM1 
113  patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we identified a specific subset of 
114  senescent-like cells expressing high levels of SASP. We confirmed cellular senescence 
115  using different markers (p16, p21, SA-b-Gal) in primary myoblasts of DM1 patients in 
116  vitro and in skeletal muscle biopsies in situ. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the level 
117  of IL-6, a key SASP cytokine, is correlated with upper- and lower-limb muscle weakness 
118  as well as functional capacity limitations in patients affected by DM1. Thereafter, we 
119  screened different senolytic drugs and have identified the B-cell lymphoma-extra large 
120  (BCL-XL) inhibitor, A1155463, as the most promising molecule to eliminate specifically 
121  senescent myoblasts cultured from DM1 patients’ samples, without affecting cells cultured 
122  from healthy controls’ samples. Elimination of senescent cells reduced SASP expression 
123  and  restored  the  myogenesis  potential  of  the  myoblasts  in  vitro  and  following  cell 
124  transplantation in vivo. Altogether, these findings support the importance of cellular 
125  senescence in the disease severity, and the therapeutic potential of senolytics to target 
126  defective myogenic cells and reduce SASP expression in DM1.

127  RESULTS 
128  Single-Cell RNAseq identifies a subset of senescent cells in DM1 myoblasts. 
129  Considering that cellular senescence only affects a subset of cells at a given moment, we 
130  took advantage of the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technology to identify the 
131  distinct transcriptional profile in cellular subpopulations of DM1 myoblasts. Myoblasts 
132  were sorted by FACS (Suppl. Fig. 1) and purity was confirmed by immunofluorescence 
133  (Suppl. Fig. 2). Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing was performed on pooled myoblasts 
134  at the same early passage (P4) from 3 DM1 patients (juvenile phenotype) and 3 age- and 
135  sex-matched healthy controls (Suppl. Table 1). After filtering and removal of doublets in 
136  the sequencing data, we analysed 1,613 control cells and 1,714 DM1 patient cells (Suppl. 
137  Fig. 3). Both controls and DM1 cells express high levels of myogenic cell markers such as 
138  CD82, ITGB1 (CD29), MYF5, MYOD1, NCAM1 (CD56), and DES, as well as low levels 
139  of the fibroadipogenic (PDGFRa and CD34), endothelial (CD31 and TIE1), and myeloid 
140  (CD11B and CD45) cell markers (Suppl. Fig. 4). UMAP plot of merged control and patient 
141  cells revealed that these cells cluster differently (Fig. 1A). Differential expression analysis 
142  revealed that the expression of 516 genes was significantly changed (P < 10e-6; n=266 
143  downregulated and n=250 upregulated) in DM1 patients compared to controls (Fig. 1B, 
144  Suppl. Table 2). Compared to healthy control cells, DM1 cells showed lower expression in 
145  genes associated to myogenic markers (e.g., MYF5, MYOD1, MYF6, SIX1), extracellular 
146  matrix components (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A2, LAMA2, FN1), Notch 
147  signalling (e.g., HEYL, RBPJ), and cell cycle (e.g., CENPF, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2, 
148  CDK1, MKI67) (Fig 1B,C; suppl. table 2). Downregulated genes in DM1 cells were 
149  enriched for biological processes related to cell cycle, muscle structure development, and

150  extracellular matrix organization (Fig 1D,F). Top upregulated genes in DM1 cells included 
151  cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, 
152  CXCL6, CXCL8, IL1B, IL6, CSF3), and metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP1, MMP3) (Fig 1 
153  B,C; suppl. table 2). Upregulated genes in DM1 cells were enriched for biological functions 
154  included  cytokine  signaling,  cellular  response  to  stress,  autophagy,  apoptosis,  and 
155  senescence  (Fig  1E,G).    SCENIC  analysis  was  used  to  predict  transcription  factors 
156  regulating the gene sets. Results showed that downregulated genes are controlled by 
157  different  transcriptions  factors  related  to  myogenesis  (e.g.,  MYF5,  MYOD1,  MYF6, 
158  SIX1), while for the genes upregulated in DM1 the transcriptions factors related to the NF-
159  kB pathway (e.g., NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELB) were identified (Fig. 1H,I). 
160  UMAP plot showed that cells expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
161  (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL8, IL6) in DM1 patients are restricted to specific cell clusters (Fig. 
162  1C). Further, SAA1 and SAA2, two target genes of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-
163  1, IL-6, and TNFa27, are also upregulated in specific subsets of DM1 myogenic cells. To 
164  further explore this senescent-like phenotype we compared the different clusters to gene 
165  sets related to cellular senescence and SASP production28. Based on this profile, we were 
166  able to classify the DM1 cells in 3 subpopulations: one subset of fully senescent cells 
167  expressing high levels of senescent genes and SASP (clusters 2, 3, 6), one subset of early-
168  senescent cells expressing senescence markers that did not transcribe into SASP cytokine 
169  secretion (cluster 4), and one subset non-senescent cells (clusters 0, 1, 5) (Fig. 2 A-D). By 
170  comparing the molecular signature of the senescent and non-senescent clusters versus all 
171  the  combined  clusters  found  in  our  control  sample,  we  observed  a  clear  senescent 
172  molecular  signature  present  only  in  the  senescent  cluster  (CXCL1,  CXCL3,  CXCL5,

173  CXCL8, MMP1, SOD2); and that the non-senescent cluster in DM1 samples expressed a 
174  similar molecular profile as our control sample (Fig. 2E). 
175  Production of SASP by senescent cells varies depending on the cell type and 
176  inducer29,30. Thus, we selected all the top differentially expressed genes (>1.7-fold) in DM1 
177  and controls samples and we investigated the presence of these genes in the SASP Atlas30, 
178  a proteomic database that analysed the SASP factors secreted by different cell types 
179  (fibroblasts and epithelial cells) subjected to multiple senescence inducers (irradiation, 
180  oncogene-induced,  treatment-induced).  These  findings  indicate  that  the  top  genes 
181  overexpressed in DM1 patients (e.g., STC1, SOD2, MMP1, CXCL5, CXCL8) are canonical 
182  SASP markers expressed at the protein level by senescent cells, regardless of the cell type 
183  or the senescence inducer (Suppl. Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the top upregulated genes 
184  in healthy control myoblasts (e.g., COL3A1, TOP2A) are negative regulators of cellular 
185  senescence in the SASP Atlas (Suppl. Fig. 5B). 
186   
187  Cellular senescence is associated with reduced myogenesis in DM1. 
188  As  single-cell  analysis  revealed  distinct  molecular  signatures  associated  to  cellular 
189  senescence in DM1 cells, we further explore how this process was affected in myogenic 
190  cells in vitro and in situ. First, we performed SA-b-Gal assay on myoblasts in vitro, and 
191  we observed an 11-fold increase (p = 0.0023) in the proportion of b-Gal + senescent cells 
192  in patient-derived DM1 myoblasts compared to healthy controls (Fig. 3A-B). Further 
193  expression analysis on cultured myoblasts confirmed that P16 is significantly upregulated 
194  (p = 0.046) in DM1 compared to controls (Fig. 3C). As senescence is characterized by cell 
195  cycle  arrest,  myoblast  proliferation  was  assessed  using  a  live  cell  imaging  system

196  (IncuCyte), and the results showed a significant reduction (p = 0.042) in cell proliferation 
197  in DM1 patients compared to controls (Fig. 3D).  
198    To determine if the accumulation of toxic RNA is the cause of cellular senescence 
199  in DM1, the number of intranuclear RNA foci was compared in senescent (SA-b-Gal+) 
200  and non-senescent (SA-b-Gal-) DM1 myoblasts. A 4-fold increase (p = 0.0017) was 
201  observed in the number of RNA foci/cell in senescent DM1 cells compared to non-
202  senescent cells (Fig. 3E,F, and suppl. Fig. 6).  
203  Thereafter, cellular senescence markers were assessed on flash frozen skeletal 
204  muscle  biopsies  to  determine  if  senescence  is  also  a  feature  of  the  disease  in  situ. 
205  Immunofluorescence  staining  on  skeletal  muscle  section  showed  a  5-fold  increase 
206  (p=0.022) in the proportion of satellite cells (PAX7+) co-expressing the cell cycle inhibitor 
207  P16 (Fig. 3G,H) in DM1 muscles compared to controls. Gene expression analysis of 
208  skeletal muscle biopsies confirmed a significant upregulation in the expression of the cell 
209  cycle inhibitors P16 (5-fold; p=0.0075) and P21 (17-fold; p=0.004) in samples from DM1 
210  patients compared to controls (Fig. 3I). 
211   
212  SASP production is correlated with muscle weakness in DM1 patients. 
213  To determine the impact of SASP production on muscle function in vivo, blood 
214  serum from DM1 patients (n=103; suppl. table 3) was collected to measure the level of 
215  expression of IL-6, a prominent SASP cytokine. Thereafter, the maximum isometric 
216  muscle strength of different muscle groups of the lower limb (ankle dorsiflexors, hip 
217  flexors, knee extensors, knee flexors) and upper limb (shoulder flexors, shoulder abductors, 
218  elbow flexors, elbow extensors) was quantitatively assessed. Using equations that adjust

219  for age, sex, and weight, the predicted strength value of each muscle group was calculated, 
220  which allowed to identify a relative deficit compared to normative value31. For the lower 
221  limb, a significant negative correlation between IL-6 levels and predicted maximal muscle 
222  strength was observed for ankle dorsiflexors (R: -0.426; p<0.001), hip flexors (R: -0.397; 
223  p<0.001), knee extensors (R: -0.273; p=0.006), and knee flexors (R: -0.300; p=0.002) (Fig. 
224  4A-D). For the upper limb, a significant negative correlation was observed for shoulder 
225  flexors (R: -0.405; p<0.001), shoulder abductors (R: -0.370; p<0.001), elbow flexors (R: -
226  0.337; p<0.001), and elbow extensors (R: -0.407; p<0.001) (Fig. 4E-H).  
227  Thereafter, we separated the group in patients expressing low or high levels of IL-
228  6, based on the normative value for healthy individuals (upper 95th percentile reference 
229  limit of healthy individuals: 4.45 pg/ml)32. Twenty-three DM1 patients out of 103 (22.3%) 
230  had IL-6 levels over the reference limit of healthy individuals, suggesting that IL-6 is 
231  abnormally elevated in this population (Fig. 4I). The average IL-6 level was 3.7-fold higher 
232  (p<0.001) in the high IL-6 expressing group (7.61 pg/ml) compared to the low IL-6 
233  expressing group (2.04 pg/ml). As expected, DM1 patients were weaker than normative 
234  values for healthy individuals for most muscle groups even if their IL-6 level was low (Fig. 
235  4J,K). However, the DM1 patients that express higher levels of IL-6 are significantly 
236  weaker compared to those that had a normal SASP profile for all muscle groups tested: 
237  ankle dorsiflexors (-18%, p=0.006), hip flexors (-14%, p=0.001), knee extensors (-12%, 
238  p=0.015), knee flexors (-12%, p=0.021), shoulder flexors (-22%, p=0.006), shoulder 
239  abductors  (-16%,  p=0.016),  elbow  flexors  (-5%,  p=0.032),  elbow  extensors  (-24%, 
240  p=0.003) (Figure 4J,K).

241  The functional capacity of DM1 participants was assessed using standardized 
242  physical tests validated in the DM1 population: the Timed-Up and Go (time to rise from a 
243  chair, walk 3 meters, walk back and sit down), 10-meter Walk-Test (10mWT; walking 
244  speed over a short distance), Berg balance scale (14-item test assessing static and dynamic

246  correlation between IL-6 levels and the scores at the Timed-Up and Go (R: 0.400; 
247  p<0.001), 10mWT (R: -0.388; p<0.001), Berg balance scale (R: -0.421; p<0.001), pinch 
248  test (R: -0.345; p<0.001) (Fig. 4L,N,P,R). There was a significant reduction in the group 
249  expressing higher levels of IL-6 compared to the one expressing lower levels of IL-6 in the 
250  performance at the different functional tests: Timed-up and Go (+1 s [+10%], p=0.005), 10 
251  mWT (-0.15 m/s [-12%], p=0.001), Berg balance scale (-4.1 [-7%], p=0.025), and pinch 
252  test (-0.74 kg [-12%], p=0.032) (Fig. 4M,O,Q,S).  
253  Further analysis using the stepwise regression model was used to verify if IL-6 is a 
254  candidate predictor variable explaining muscle strength and functional outcomes. Results 
255  show that IL-6, together with the clinical phenotype, age and/or sex of the patient, is a 
256  variable that explain the variance of the scores obtained by participants to the Timed-up 
257  and Go (standardized β: 0.18, p=0.048), 10mWT (standardized β: -0.2, p=0.003), Berg 
258  balance scale (standardized β: -0.3, p=0.01), and the predicted maximal muscle strength of 
259  hip  flexors  (standardized  β:  -0.27,  p=0.02),  knee  extensors  (standardized  β:  -0.20, 
260  p=0.034), knee flexors (standardized β: -0.19, p=0.034), ankle dorsiflexors (standardized 
261  β: -0.24, p=0.005), shoulder flexors (standardized β: -0.28, p=0.002), shoulder abductors 
262  (standardized β: -0.22, p=0.009), elbow flexors (standardized β: -0.18, p=0.034), and elbow 
263  extensors (standardized β: -0.206, p<0.001) (Suppl. table 4).

264  The  same  analyses  were  performed  based  on  the  serum  level  of  TNFa.  No 
265  correlation was observed between TNFa levels and the strength of ankle dorsiflexors, hip 
266  flexors, knee extensors, knee flexors, shoulder flexors, shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, 
267  elbow extensors, 10mWT, and pinch test (suppl. Fig. 7). Only the Berg balance test (R: 
268  0.269; p=0.006) and the Timed-up and go (R: -0.305; p=0.009) showed a mild correlation 
269  with TNFa levels. 
270  Altogether, our findings indicate that cellular senescence and SASP are hallmarks 
271  of DM1, which could explain the reduced myogenic capacity and the impaired muscle 
272  function. Therefore, we next explored the possibility of eliminating these senescent cells 
273  as a potential therapy to alleviate DM1 disease progression. 
274   
275  Senolytics  specifically  eliminate  senescent  myoblasts  in  DM1  and  reduce  SASP 
276  expression 
277  Considering that the pathophysiological mechanism behind cellular senescence varies 
278  depending on the inducers and cell types, we tested the impact of six different senolytics 
279  that act through different mechanisms to induce apoptosis of senescent cells: the FOXO4-
280  DRI  peptide  (p53-FOXO4  interaction),  Fisetin  (PI3K/AKT  pathway),  Dasatinib  + 
281  Quercetin (PI3K/AKT pathway), Navitoclax (BCL-2/BCL-X inhibitor), A1331852 and 
282  A1155463 (Selective BCL-X  inhibitors)24,35-38. Analysis of cell viability following the 
L
283  treatment of myoblasts with different concentrations of senolytics showed that FOXO4-
284  DRI, Dasatinib + Quercetin, and fisetin were toxic for cells isolated from both healthy 
285  controls and DM1 patients (Suppl. Fig. 8). Navitoclax selectively eliminated cells in DM1 
286  samples at a specific concentration (3 µm); however, A1155463 was the most effective to

287  target cells specifically in the DM1 group and not affect the healthy cell viability (Fig. 5A). 
288  Moreover, A1155463 was effective at a lower concentration, in the nanomolar range. 
289  Therefore, this lead compound was chosen for the following experiments. To confirm that 
290  A1155463 induced apoptosis of senescent cells, an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay 
291  was performed on healthy and DM1 myoblasts. Treatment of myoblasts with A1155463 at 
292  a dose of 100 nM showed increased apoptosis only in the DM1 samples (Fig. 5B,C). SA-
293  b-Gal staining on DM1 or controls myoblasts treated with vehicle or A1155463 showed a 
294  significant reduction in the number of SA-b-Gal+ senescent cells in the A1155463-treated 
295  DM1 group (Fig. 5D,E). Further analysis of senescence genes expression demonstrated 
296  that A1155463 treatment reduced P16 expression in DM1 samples, but not in controls (Fig. 
297  5F). The expression of SASP factors was analysed by multiplex Luminex assay in DM1 
298  cells  treated  with  A1155463  or  vehicle.  Results  showed  that  senolytic  treatment 
299  significantly reduced the expression of many SASP factors such as CSF3 (p=0.0005), 
300  CXCL1 (p=0.018), CXCL8 (p=0.002), CCL2 (p=0.041), MMP1 (p=0.009), and MMP3 
301  (p=0.027) (Figure 5G). A trend toward reduction was also observed for IL-6 (p=0.078), 
302  CCL7 (p=0.054), MMP2 (p=0.06), and MMP12 (p=0.07). On the other hand, growth 
303  factors that stimulate cell proliferation such as EGF (p=0.0005) and FGF2 (p=0.026) were 
304  increased by A1155463 treatment (Suppl. Fig 9). Other anti-inflammatory cytokines and 
305  growth factors such as IL-4 (p=0.28), IL-13 (p=0.13), FLT-3L (p=0.25), and VEGF-A 
306  (p=0.38) were not significantly affected by the treatment (Suppl. Fig. 9).

309  Next, we aimed to determine if the elimination of senescent cells, and the associated 
310  reduction in the expression of SASP factors, in A1155463-treated DM1 myoblasts restores 
311  the myogenic potential of the non-senescent cells. Myoblasts were treated with A1155463 
312  or vehicle for 1 day and were allowed to recover in proliferating media for 3 days. 
313  Immunostaining for the proliferation marker KI67 revealed that A1155463-treatment 
314  increased the proportion of KI67+ cells in the DM1 samples (1.8-fold increase), but not in 
315  the controls (Fig. 6A-B). In another set of experiments, myoblasts were treated with 
316  A1155463 or vehicle for 1 day and incubated in low serum differentiating medium for 5 
317  days. Immunofluorescence staining for the differentiation marker MYOG revealed a 
318  significant increase (2.2-fold) in the proportion of MYOG+ cells only in the DM1 samples, 
319  and not in the controls (Fig. 6C-D). This increase in MYOG expression in the DM1 samples 
320  was also confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 6E-F). 
321  To better address the in vivo myogenic potential of DM1 myoblasts treated with 
322  A1155163, we performed a cell transplantation assay. Three different DM1 myoblast lines 
323  were treated with A1155463 (100 nM for 24 h) or vehicle and cells were allowed to recover 
324  in proliferating media for 3 days. These cells were transplanted into the tibialis anterior 
325  muscle of NSG mice that were injured by cardiotoxin (CTX) injection 1 day before. 
326  Regenerated TA muscles were collected 21 days post-CTX injection (Fig. 6G). Cell 
327  engraftment  was  assessed  by  co-immunolabeling  for  the  human  dystrophin  protein 
328  (hDMD) and total dystrophin protein (tDMD) (Fig. 6H). We observed that A1155463 
329  enhanced DM1 cell engraftment by 50% when compared to vehicle (Fig. 6I). Taken 
330  together these results indicate that A1155463 treatment can significantly improve the 
331  myogenic potential of DM1 myoblasts in vivo.

332  DISCUSSION 
333  Our findings demonstrate that cellular senescence is a hallmark of myogenic cells in DM1. 
334  Using single cell transcriptomics and multiplex Luminex assay, we show that a subset of 
335  these cells displays a molecular signature characterized by high levels of expression of 
336  SASP factors. Our findings show that IL-6, a ubiquitous SASP factor, is associated with 
337  muscle weakness and functional limitations in DM1 patients. By screening for different 
338  senolytics, we identify a lead molecule, A1155463, that specifically eliminates senescent 
339  cells in DM1. The senolytic-induced reduction of SASP is associated with a restoration of 
340  the myogenic potential of DM1 myoblasts in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, these findings 
341  provide novel insights on the physiopathology of DM1 and identify a new therapeutic 
342  avenue for the treatment of this disease. 
343   
344  Signs of cellular senescence have been observed previously in cells isolated from skeletal 
345  muscles of DM1 patients; however, these studies used a mixed population of cells that were 
346  not purified by FACS and they did not validate if these senescence markers are co-
347  expressed  with  myogenic  cell  markers11-13.  Therefore,  it  was  not  possible  to  clearly 
348  delineate if myogenic cells, or if fibroblasts for instance, were becoming senescent. 
349  Particularly, fibroblasts or mesenchymal stromal cells are a predominant senescent cell 
350  type in various pathogenic conditions39. Here, we use FACS purified myogenic cells and 
351  we have confirmed that senescence markers (e.g., P16) are expressed in DM1 purified 
352  myoblasts. Moreover, co-staining for P16 positive cells and PAX7 on skeletal muscle 
353  biopsies revealed the presence of senescent muscle stem cells in situ, which has never been 
354  described before. These findings indicate that cellular senescence in DM1 is not only an in

355  vitro artefact caused by replicative stress, but a relevant pathophysiological process of the 
356  disease. Furthermore, our experiments were performed on samples from individuals with 
357  the  infantile,  juvenile  or  adult  form  of  the  disease,  while  previous  studies  focused 
358  exclusively on the more severe congenital form, suggesting that cellular senescence is a 
359  hallmark of the disease no matter the clinical form12,40.  
360   
361  Our findings show that the accumulation of RNA foci in the nuclei of DM myoblasts is 
362  associated with cellular senescence, suggesting that RNA-meditated toxicity is the cause 
363  of senescence in this disease. Toxic RNA accumulation caused by the CTG repeats in the 
364  DMPK gene is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative 
365  damage in DM114,41-44. Chronic ROS production triggers a DNA damage response leading 
366  to cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence, which in turn secretes further ROS and SASP 
367  leading to a feed-forward cycle14,45,46. Using C2C12 cells it was shown that the insertion 
368  of CUG repeats increases ROS production, which is further exacerbated by H O  exposure, 
2 2
369  suggesting that DM1 cells produce more ROS and are more sensitive to oxidative stress14. 
370  Analysis of the GO enrichment data of our single cell transcriptomic dataset show that the 
371  most dysregulated genes in DM1 patients’ cells are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. 
372  Moreover, pathway analysis also shows an enrichment for genes related to ROS and 
373  reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production. Analyses from other datasets also show an 
374  increase in ROS producing genes (e.g., NOX4) and a decrease in antioxidant genes (e.g. 
375  SOD3)14,47. Notably, the expression of antioxidant genes such as SOD1, SOD2, and GPX1 
376  have been positively associated with muscle strength in another DM1 transcriptomic 
377  dataset, suggesting that antioxidant levels could help protect against senescence-associated

378  muscle  wasting48.  Overall,  our  findings  and  others  suggest  that  senescence  in  DM1 
379  myoblasts is induced by toxic RNA-mediated oxidative stress. 
380   
381  Other transcriptomics datasets have been generated on DM1 tissues and cells (reviewed in 
382  49). A study on DM1 myogenic cells showed that the transcriptional changes are more 
383  important in DM1 myoblasts than myotubes47. GO term analysis showed that the biological 
384  processes that are mostly enriched in DM1 myoblasts are signalling pathways, ECM 
385  components,  and  cytoskeletal  organisation47.  Another  RNAseq  dataset  performed  on 
386  human embryonic stem cells (DM1 and controls) differentiated into myogenic cells showed 
387  that inflammatory pathways such as IL6-JAK-STAT3 signalling are overexpressed in DM1 
388  cells, which is coherent with the inflammatory signature that we observed50. Similarly, 
389  RNAseq analysis performed on isogenic myoblasts containing or not a CTG  expansion 
2600
390  showed an enrichment in biological processes such as cellular response to IFNg51. Using a 
391  model of C2C12 cells containing expanded CUG repeats, it was also shown that toxic RNA 
392  expression induces a senescence-like signature characterized by enrichment in genes 
393  related to ECM organisation, response to oxygen levels, apoptosis, and regulation of cell 
394  growth14. Transcriptomic analysis on skeletal muscle samples from individuals with the 
395  congenital  form  of  DM1  showed  a  signature  very  similar  to  our  scRNAseq  dataset 
396  characterized by downregulation in myogenesis genes and upregulation in inflammatory 
397  genes, such as the IL6/STAT3 target genes SAA1 and SAA240. Moreover, supporting our 
398  results, RNAseq on muscle samples from DM1 patients and controls showed that genes 
 
399  related to SASP factors (e.g. CXCL14, CXCL16, and MMP2) or cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. 
400  CDKN1A, TP63)52, are negatively correlated with muscle strength in DM148. RNAseq

401  performed in other tissues such as the frontal cortex showed an enrichment in inflammatory 
402  genes compared to healthy individuals, suggesting that the pro-inflammatory signature is 
403  a common feature in different DM1 tissues53. These findings bring important insights on 
404  the  molecular  mechanisms  in  DM1,  however,  bulk  RNAseq  analysis  limits  the 
405  interpretations regarding the subpopulation of cells affected. Particularly, it is not possible 
406  with  these  datasets  to  determine  if  the  inflammatory  signature  is  generalized  or 
407  circumscribed to a specific subset of cells, which is especially important in the context of 
408  cellular senescence.  
409   
410  To assess the specific molecular signature of myogenic cells in DM1, we used an 
411  unbiased approach through scRNAseq. This is the first single cell transcriptomics dataset 
412  generated in DM149 This dataset allowed to identify specific cell clusters expressing 
.
413  different levels of senescence markers leading to a better comprehension of the different 
414  stages of senescence in myoblasts of patients with DM1. Particularly, we identified a 
415  specific cluster of DM1 myoblasts expressing high levels of SASP factors, while another 
416  cluster expressed higher levels of SAA1 and SAA2, two molecules that are triggered by 
417  SASP factors and can further stimulate SASP expression by a positive feedback loop27,54. 
418  These findings suggest that the expression of SASP by senescent cells have paracrine 
419  effects on neighbouring cells and promote their senescence-like phenotype. Moreover, this 
420  dataset identified that, while a subset of cells shows a fully senescent or early senescent 
421  profile, there is a significant proportion of cells that had a similar molecular profile as the 
422  one found in our control samples from healthy individuals. These results suggest that 
423  elimination  of  the  senescent  myoblasts  could  restore  the  myogenic  activity  of  non-

424  senescent DM1 myoblasts. Several studies used this approach to alleviate chronic and 
425  degenerative diseases in which senescence contributes to the progression of the disease 
426  (reviewed in 55,56). By testing different senolytic drugs, we observed that DM1 senescent 
427  myoblasts were particularly responsive to inhibitors targeting the BCL family members. 
428  Navitoclax (ABT-263; BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor) was effective at targeting senescent 
429  myoblasts in DM1, similar to what was shown in an aging model38; however, the highest 
430  efficiency was achieved with the BCL-XL inhibitor A1155463. Notably, our SCENIC 
431  analysis showed an enrichment in the activity of the transcription factors of the NF-kB 
432  family, which are known to bind to promoter region of Bcl-xl gene to stimulate its 
433  expression57. Other widely used senolytic such as FOXO4-DRI, fisetin, or dasatinib + 
434  quercetin that affect other pathways were ineffective to specifically target senescent DM1 
435  myoblasts24,36, which indicate that the senescent molecular signature expressed in DM1 
436  myoblasts is distinct to this cell type/inducer and that specific molecular targeting is 
437  necessary to eliminate these cells.  
438   
439  Our findings demonstrate that IL-6, a main component of the SASP cocktail, is 
440  correlated with muscle weakness and functional capacity limitations in DM1. These results 
441  are consistent with previous observations showing that members of the IL-6 signalling 
442  pathway are correlated with signs of histological degenerative changes in the congenital 
443  form of the disease40. On the other hand, our findings show that another pro-inflammatory 
444  cytokine, TNFa, was not correlated with muscle weakness. These results are consistent 
445  with our scRNAseq data showing an increase in the expression of IL6 but not TNF in 
446  samples from DM1 patients. These results suggest that there is a specific SASP signature

447  associated with muscle weakness in DM1, and not only a generalized pro-inflammatory 
448  profile. Similarly, another study screened for 20 pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum 
449  of patients affected by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and identified IL-6 as the 
450  only cytokine correlating with muscle weakness and disease severity58. These findings 
451  suggest that IL-6 is a promising biomarker to determine the severity of muscle dysfunction 
452  in DM159. 
453 
 
454  Our results also suggest that targeting SASP cytokines such as IL-6 is a valid 
455  therapeutic approach to mitigate disease progression. Our findings showed that specific 
456  elimination of senescent DM1 myoblasts leads to a reduction in the expression of SASP 
457  molecules,  which  restores  the  myogenic  function  of  non-senescent  DM1  myoblasts 
458  through an improvement of their cellular proliferation and differentiation capacity. These 
459  results are consistent with a previous study showing that the secretion of SASP by 
460  senescent cells block myoblast differentiation in vitro60. The improvement in myogenesis 
461  was not observed in cells from healthy individuals, which confirms that the senolytic drug 
462  targets a specific pathophysiological mechanism in DM1. 
463   
464  Overall,  this  study  describes  a  well-defined  senescent  molecular  signature  in  DM1 
465  myogenic cells, which brings novel insights on the pathophysiological mechanisms of the 
466  disease. Particularly, it identifies the production of SASP as a major characteristic of DM1 
467  myoblasts, which is associated with muscle weakness in DM1. We demonstrated that 
468  specific drugs can be used to target these defective cells and restore myogenesis. These 
469  findings open a new therapeutic avenue that could help to mitigate the impact of DM1, a 
470  disease for which no treatment currently exists to slow symptoms progression61.

472  METHODS 
473   
474  Participants’ recruitment 
475  Patients were recruited at the Saguenay Neuromuscular Clinic of Jonquière (Québec, 
476  Canada) and healthy individuals were recruited among the friends/family members or team 
477  members. Inclusion criteria for DM1 participants were to be aged over 18-year-old and 
478  have a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DM1. One hundred and three DM1 participants 
479  were  recruited  between  2002-2004  and  completed  muscle  and  functional  capacity 
480  assessments and blood sample collection. Ten DM1 patients and seven healthy individuals 
481  were recruited in 2019 and undergone a muscle biopsy only. This study was approved by 
482  the Ethics review board of the Centre de santé et de services sociaux de Chicoutimi, 
483  Canada. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 
484   
485  Muscle strength, functional capacity assessments, and blood sample collection 
486  A blood sample was taken from each participant and the level of IL-6 was measured at the 
487  Centre de recherche sur les maladies lipidiques of the Centre hospitalier de l’Université 
488  Laval (Québec, Canada). DM1 patients were classified in a low or high IL-6 expressing 
489  group based on the cut-off value representing the upper 95th percentile value for healthy 
490  individuals  (4.45  pg/ml)32.  The  maximum  isometric  muscle  strength  of  the  ankle 
491  dorsiflexors,  hip  flexors,  knee  flexors,  knee  extensors,  shoulder  flexors,  shoulder 
492  abductors, elbow flexors and elbow extensors was assessed using quantitative muscle 
493  testing according to a standardized protocol62. Muscle strength was expressed as the

495  normative database using predictive equations taking into consideration age, sex, and 
496  weight of the patients31. Patients were subjected to a battery of validated functional 
497  tests63,64. Timed-up and Go: time to stand up, walk three meters, turn and walk back to sit 
498  down on the chair; 10mWT: comfortable walking speed (m/s) along a 10-meter distance; 
499  Berg balance scale: 14 items measuring static and dynamic balance (maximum score of 56 
500  indicating no deficit in balance); Pinch strength: measured using a B&L pinch gauge (kg). 
501  All tests were conducted under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist 
502    
503  Muscle biopsy 
504  A biopsy of the vastus lateralis at the mid-thigh level was taken using the modified 
505  Bergstrom needle technique with suction65. A ~200 mg sample of muscle was obtained, 
506  rinsed in sterile phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) and portioned out for the various 
507  following analyses. The first half of the sample (approximately 100 mg) was kept in sterile 
508  SK-MAX media (Wisent Bio) on ice for muscle stem cell isolation. The second half of the 
509  muscle sample was separated in two parts that were flash frozen for qPCR analysis (50 mg) 
510  or embedded in OCT tissue freezing medium and frozen in 2-methylbutaned cooled in 
511  liquid nitrogen (50 mg). The samples were stored at -80°C.

517  few days until there were enough cells for purification by FACS. Myoblasts were stained 
518  with 7-AAD (cell viability) and with the positive selection marker anti-CD56 AF647-
519  conjugated (clone R19-760, BD biosciences). Of note, preliminary experiments showed 
520  that virtually all CD56+ cells were also positive for another myogenic marker CD82 (data 
521  not shown) 67, and therefore only CD56 was used for the follow-up experiments. Myoblasts 
522  differentiation was induced by exposing cells to 2% horse serum (HS) in DMEM media. 
523  Control and DM1 myoblasts were used for experiments at the same low passage (maximum 
524  P6). 
525   
526  Single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments 
527  Single cell suspensions of myogenic cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.04% 
528  ultra-pure BSA. scRNAseq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 30 
529  Reagent Kits v3.1 (10x Genomics; Pleasanton, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
530  instructions68. Generated libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000.  
531  Raw sequencing data were preprocessed using Cell Ranger 6.1.269 to perform the 
532  alignment  (human  genome  GRCh38- 2020-A),  filtering,  barcode  counting,  and  UMI 
533  counting at a single cell resolution, generating a control, patient, and a merged digital gene 
534  expression (DGE) matrix containing 1,902, 2,029 and 3,931 cells respectively. Further 
535  downstream analyses were conducted using R package Seurat v4.0 (spatial reconstruction 
536  of single-cell gene expression data70) and singleCellTK v2.2.0 (Single cell Toolkit). 
537  Quality control: Due to deep sequencing of the libraries, for each DGE matrix, cells 
538  expressing fewer than 1,000 genes and more than 10% of mitochondrial genes were filtered 
539  out, leaving a total of 3,381 cells in the merged matrix (1,639 cells from controls and 1,742

540  cells from patients). For all cells, genes were excluded if they were expressed in less than 
541  3 cells. We normalized the DGE matrices by the total number of UMIs in each cell and 
542  scaled by 106 to yield counts per million (CPM). We natural log transformed these matrices 
543  after the addition of a pseudocount of 1 to avoid undefined values. 
544  The 2,000 most variable genes were selected for each DGE matrix, based on their 
545  relative dispersion (variance/mean) regarding to the expected value across genes with 
546  similar average expression71. Next, we performed a linear transformation (‘scaling’) to 
547  each matrix to minimize variations due to technical noise or possible batch effects. 
548  We used DoubletFinder72 to identify putative doublets in each DGE matrix relying 
549  solely on gene expression data. DoubletFinder requires three input parameters for the 
550  doublet classification: the number of expected real doublets (nExp), the number of artificial 
551  doublets (pN) and the neighborhood size (pK). We calculated the nExp by multiplying the 
552  number of cells by the expected doublet ratio (1.6%) based on 10x genomics Chromium 
553  user guide. To identify pN and pK values, we performed the parameter optimization of 
554  DoubletFinder resulting in a pN of 0.30 for all matrices and a pK of 0.24, 0.01 and 0.005 
555  for the control, patient, and merged matrices respectively. After the removal of putative 
556  doublets, we remain with 1,613 cells in the control, 1,714 cells in the patient, and 3,327 
557  cells in the merged matrix for downstream analyses. 
558  We estimated cell cycle activity by scoring the expression of a set of S phase–
559  associated and G2/M phase–associated genes, as implemented in Seurat70. 
560  To enable unsupervised clustering, we performed a linear dimensionality reduction 
561  with principal component analysis (PCA) on each DGE matrix using the highly variable 
562  genes previously identified. Once embedded in this PCA space, we applied a K-nearest

563  neighbor (KNN) graph-based clustering approach and refine the edge weights between any 
564  two cells based on the shared overlap in their local neighborhoods, identifying the k = 10 
565  nearest neighbors for each cell.  To cluster the cells, we apply a Louvain algorithm73 to 
566  iteratively group cells together, with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity 
567  function. A resolution of 0.3 was used in the patient matrix to identify more defined cell 
568  populations. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)74 and the Uniform 
569  Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) were used to visualize the clustering 
570  results; however, UMAP was chosen because it provides a better separation of the groups. 
571  We computed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between controls and patients 
572  using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for FDR 
573  control75, identifying positive and negative markers for each group. DEGs with |logFC| > 
574  1.0 and adjusted p-values < 10e-6 were considered. In addition, we also computed the 
575  proportion and the probability distribution of cells expressing each gene in each group. 
576  To identify DEGs among patient clusters and patient cells after the senescence annotation 
577  (method described below), we used the model-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics 
578  method (MAST)76. DEGs with |logFC| >0.25, FDR <0.05, percentage cluster expression > 
579  0.5, percentage expression in the control group < 0.4, and adjusted p-values <0.01 were 
580  considered. For the senescent and non-senescent populations, DEGs with an adjusted p-
581  values <0.01 and logFC > 1.5 in one condition and logFC <1.5 in the other condition were 
582  plotted regardless the expression of the control. 
583  Gene Ontology terms were analyzed for DEGs identified in each cell type using the 
584  online Metascape tool (https://metascape.org)77 with default parameters: Min Overlap = 3, 
585  p-value Cut-off = 0.05, and Min Enrichment = 1.5. The top 20 terms ranked by p-value

587  package ReactomePA v1.36.0 and displayed in a bubble diagram78. 
588  To perform the annotation of senescent and non-senescent cells in patient cells, we 
589  used the R package GSVA v1.40.1 79 to compare the average expression of the DEGs of 
590  each patient cluster with reference gene sets related to cellular senescence and secretory

592  in all gene sets were annotated as fully senescent cells, clusters with GSVA scores < 0 in 
593  all gene sets were annotated as non-senescent cells, and clusters with positive and negative 
594  GRVA values were annotated as early senescent cells.
