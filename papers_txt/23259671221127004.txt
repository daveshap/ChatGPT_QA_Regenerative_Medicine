Investigation performed at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA
Background: The application of orthobiologics at the time of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) has received an increasing
amountofclinicalinterestdespitearelativescarcityofhumanclinicalstudiesontheirefficacy.
Purpose:Toutilizeanationaladministrativedatabasetodeterminetheassociationofbonemarrowaspirateconcentrate(BMAC)

StudyDesign:Cohortstudy;Levelofevidence,3.
Methods:TheMarinerdatasetfromthePearlDiver patientrecords repositorywasutilizedtoidentify patientsundergoing RCR
usingCurrentProceduralTerminology(CPT)code29827.PatientsreceivingBMACorPRPatthetimeofRCRwerethenidentified
usingCPTcoding.Forcomparisonpurposes,amatchedcohortwascreatedconsistingofpatientswhounderwentRCRwithout
biologic augmentation in a 5:1 fashion for each biologic separately. Cases were matched according to age, sex, tobacco use,
biceps tenodesis, distal clavicle excision, and subacromial decompression. All groups were then queried for revision RCR or
conversion to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Revision rates were compared utilizing a multivariate binomial logistic regression
analysis.Adjustedoddsratios(ORs)and95%CIswerecalculated.
Results:Atotalof760patientswhounderwentbiologicaugmentationduringRCRwereidentified,including646patientsinthe
PRPgroupand114patientsintheBMACgroup.Theywerecomparedwith3800matchedcontrolswithoutdocumentedbiologic
