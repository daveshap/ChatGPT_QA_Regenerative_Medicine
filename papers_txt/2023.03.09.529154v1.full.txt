Abstract  
The correct inheritance of chromatin structure is key for maintaining genome function and 
cell  identity  and  preventing  cellular  transformation.  DEK,  a  conserved  non-histone 
chromatin protein, has recognized tumor-promoting properties, its overexpression being 
associated with poor prognosis in various cancer types. At the cellular level, DEK displays 
pleiotropic  functions,  influencing  differentiation,  apoptosis,  and  stemness,  but  a 
characteristic  oncogenic  mechanism  has  remained  elusive.  Here  we  report  the 
identification of DEK bodies, focal assemblies of DEK regularly occurring at specific, yet 
unidentified sites of heterochromatin replication exclusively in late S-phase. In these 
bodies, DEK localizes in direct proximity to active replisomes in agreement with a function 
in the early maturation of heterochromatin. A high-throughput siRNA screen, supported 
by mutational and biochemical analyses, identifies SUMO as a major regulator of DEK 
body  formation,  linking  DEK  to  the  complex  SUMO  protein  network  that  controls 
chromatin states and cell fate. This work combines and refines our previous data on DEK 
as a factor essential for heterochromatin integrity and facilitating replication under stress 
and delineates an avenue of further study for unraveling DEK´s contribution to cancer 
development.

Introduction 
Replication of genomes is a fundamental process requiring meticulously orchestrated, yet 
adaptable mechanisms in space and time. The replication machinery encounters a range 
of different chromatin structures, some of which are prone to delaying, impairing, or even 
stalling replication fork progression - a state referred to as DNA replication stress (Maya-
Mendoza et al., 2018) and often encountered in cancer cells (Boyer et al., 2016; Saxena 
and Zou, 2022). Overcoming such obstacles requires the coordinated action of a number 
of  protective  chromatin  factors,  often  governed  by  targeted  post-translational 
modifications,  with  poly(ADP)ribosylation  and  SUMOylation  playing  prominent  roles 
(Abbas, 2021; Stewart-Morgan et al., 2020). Active DNA replication forks, as visualized 
by incorporation of DNA precursors (BrdU, EdU or other thymidine analogues) or via 
marking DNA replication factors (e.g. Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, PCNA) (Chagin 
et al., 2016; Jackson and Pombo, 1998) appear as a characteristic pattern of nuclear foci 
that changes over time and typically reflects the chromatin structure being replicated 
(Aladjem, 2007; Casas-Delucchi et al., 2012; Heinz et al., 2018; O’Keefe et al., 1992; 
Sehwaiger et al., 2009). In general, euchromatin undergoes DNA replication during early 
S-phase,  facultative  heterochromatin  during  middle  S-phase,  and  constitutive 
heterochromatin during late S-phase (Chadwick and Willard, 2004; Fragkos et al., 2015; 
Ryba et al., 2010; Su et al., 2020). However, some “hard-to-replicate” DNA structures, 
e.g., inactivated X chromosome, telomeres, centromeres, or certain DNA secondary 
structures, such as G-quadruplexes, four-way junction DNA and others, pose a particular 
challenge to the DNA replication machinery, and, in turn, require fine-tuned action of 
additional accessory factors (Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007).  
We and others have identified the DEK oncogene, a unique and multifunctional non-
histone chromosomal protein, as a supportive factor of DNA replication, particularly in 
scenarios where the replication machinery is under stress (Deutzmann et al., 2015; Ganz 
et al., 2019). Although Isolation of Proteins on Nascent DNA (iPOND) studies support no 
direct association of DEK with the replisome, DEK is enriched in maturing chromatin 
(Alabert et al., 2014; Aranda et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 2017; Lossaint et al., 2013; Ribeyre

et al., 2016; Sirbu et al., 2013), in line with its post-translational modification-dependent 
function as histone chaperone and its role in the maintenance of chromatin structure 
(Alexiadis et al., 2000; Böhm et al., 2005; Cavellán et al., 2006; Gamble and Fisher, 2007; 
Guo et al., 2021a; Hollenbach et al., 2002; Kappes et al., 2001; Kappes et al., 2004a; 
Kappes et al., 2004b; Kappes et al., 2011a; Privette Vinnedge et al., 2013; Saha et al., 
2013; Sawatsubashi et al., 2010; Tabbert et al., 2006; Waidmann et al., 2014; Waldmann 
et al., 2002; Waldmann et al., 2003). Under moderate to severe replication stress, DEK 
is highly enriched at maturing chromatin, suggesting a protective role at the replication 
fork. Our previous research demonstrated that down-regulation of DEK in cells under 
moderate short-term replication stress via aphidicolin and camptothecin treatment results 
in  the  aggravation  of  replication  stress  phenotypes.  Replication  fork  progression, 
proliferative capability and clonogenic survival were impaired and cells accumulated 
replication-born DNA damage and transmitted it to daughter cells (Deutzmann et al., 
2015).  Such  fork-protective  properties  of  DEK  are  modulated  by  PARP1/2  activity 
depending on the type and extent of replication stress (Ganz et al., 2019). At the same 
time, DEK appears to safeguard DNA replication also under steady-state, unchallenged 
conditions, as DNA fiber assays showed a mild decrease in fork speed when DEK 
expression is downregulated in untreated cells (Deutzmann et al., 2015). Collectively, 
these findings suggest that DEK is not a direct component of the replisome but binds in 
the vicinity of the fork to facilitate fork progression by supporting chromatin maturation. 
Evidence  for  a  role  of  DEK  in  DNA  replication  via  its  properties  as  a  chromatin 
architectural  protein  comes  also  from  in  vitro  studies:  experiments  with  SV40 mini-
chromosomes showed that DEK introduces positive supercoils to chromatin and reduces 
the replication efficiency of chromatin in a reconstituted system (Alexiadis et al., 2000; 
Waldmann  et  al.,  2002).  Furthermore,  DEK  preferentially  associates  with  four-way 
junctions over duplex DNA and with supercoiled over linear DNA, both structures that can 
induce replication stress per se or can be consequences of replication stress (Böhm et 
al., 2005; Waldmann et al., 2003).  
Under steady-state conditions DEK associates with chromatin throughout the cell cycle 
(Kappes et al., 2001; Matrka et al., 2015), typically observed as pan-nuclear punctate

pattern in immunofluorescence images and further supported by the requirement for 
medium to high salt concentrations for its extraction from nuclei preparations (Kappes et 
al., 2001; Kappes et al., 2004a; Kappes et al., 2008; Özçelik et al., 2022; Saha et al., 
2013), all in line with its pleiotropic involvement in multiple nuclear processes, ranging 
from  transcriptional  regulation,  DNA  damage  response  and  repair,  apoptosis,  cell 
stemness and chromatin maintenance (Privette Vinnedge et al., 2013; Waldmann et al., 
2004). More detailed analyses revealed that DEK can associate both with euchromatin 
and heterochromatin (Capitano et al., 2022; Gamble and Fisher, 2007; Guo et al., 2021a; 
Hollenbach et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2005; Ivanauskiene et al., 2014; Kappes et al., 2001; 
Kappes et al., 2004a; Kappes et al., 2004b; Kappes et al., 2008; Kappes et al., 2011b; 
Karam et al., 2014; Privette Vinnedge et al., 2013; Saha et al., 2013; Sandén and 
Gullberg, 2015; Sandén et al., 2014; Sawatsubashi et al., 2010; Waidmann et al., 2014; 
Zhou et  al.,  2022).  However,  qualitative  and  quantitative differences  in  the  specific 
chromatin distribution of DEK amongst cell types and conditions are evident. Whereas 
DEK was identified as a suppressor of variegation (Su(var)), thus as a factor important 
for maintenance of heterochromatin (Capitano et al., 2019; Kappes et al., 2011a; Saha et 
al., 2013), other studies show preferential association with euchromatin (Hu et al., 2007; 
Ivanauskiene et al., 2014; Sandén et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2022), pinpointing to cell-type-
specific  post-translational modifications  on DEK  as  critical for its  specific  chromatin 
association. Indeed, DEK is targeted by a plethora of post-translational modifications, with 
biological effects for acetylation, phosphorylation and poly(ADP)ribosylation having been 
reported (Cleary et al., 2005; Fahrer et al., 2010; Kappes et al., 2004a; Kappes et al., 
2004b; Kappes et al., 2008; Mor-Vaknin et al., 2011; Tabbert et al., 2006). Moreover, DEK 
contains an RNA binding motif and is found associated with cellular RNA (Baltz et al., 
2012; Beckmann et al., 2015; Castello et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2021a; Guo et al., 2021b). 
These data delineate DEK as a multifaceted protein subject to complex regulation and 
impacting multiple nuclear processes.   
To deepen our insight in DEK´s functional mechanisms, in particular related to DNA 
replication, we investigated the dynamic localization of DEK in the nucleus throughout the 
cell cycle by live and high-resolution microscopy including optical nanoscopy (Diaspro

and Bianchini, 2020). We discovered that, in late S-phase, DEK consistently forms 
discrete  foci,  now  termed  DEK  bodies,  which  locate  in  close  proximity  of  active 
heterochromatic replication sites. We then conducted an imaging-based siRNA screen to 
identify  cellular  regulators  involved  in  the  formation  of  DEK  bodies.  Besides 
methyltransferases,  acetylases  and  proteins  involved  in  checkpoint  regulation,  we 
surprisingly identified SUMO and ubiquitin enzymes, with SUMO1/3 as top candidates. 
Driven by this finding, we show that DEK is targeted by SUMOylation in vitro and in cells, 
and that SUMO modification of DEK is required, at least in part, for the establishment of 
DEK bodies. Our data refine our previous knowledge about DEK´s involvement in DNA 
replication  and  put  forward  DEK  as  a  co-factor  in  the  duplication  of  specific 
heterochromatic regions including pericentric chromatin. These findings provide further 
insights into the post-translational-dependent mechanisms by which DEK contributes to 
heterochromatin formation and maintenance with consequences for a variety of cellular 
processes.

Results 
A sub-population of DEK molecules assembles into complex nuclear bodies at 
sites of late DNA replication.  
To obtain precise insights into the distribution of DEK on chromatin in the context of DNA 
replication, we first investigated its sub-nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle along 
with EdU or PCNA as replication fork markers. Confocal imaging of endogenous DEK in 
EdU-labeled  MCF10A  cells  (Fig.  1A)  revealed  an  archetypical,  mostly  uniform  and 
punctuate nuclear pattern of DEK in G1/G2 and early to mid S-phase, in full agreement 
with  previous  observations  as  outlined  above.  In  late  S-phase,  however,  as  far 
undescribed, distinct focal assemblies of DEK became visible which located in spatial 
proximity or within DNA replication foci as assessed either by EdU pulse labeling or by 
PCNA immunofluorescence (Fig.1B, C). We made the same observation in wild-type U2-
OS cells (Fig. 1D upper row) and primary BJ-5ta cells (Fig. S1A, B, C), where S-phase 
was assessed by PCNA staining. Interestingly, in contrast to non-malignant MCF10A 
cells, no or very few foci occurred under identical conditions in MCF7 (non-invasive and 
poorly aggressive with low metastatic potential) or MDA-MB-231 (invasive metastatic) 
breast cancer cells (Fig. S1D, E), suggesting cell-type dependent differences and a 
potential correlation of DEK foci formation with malignancy. Focal accumulations of DEK 
in late S-phase were observed also with a previously established U2-OS cell line carrying 
a TALEN-mediated knock-in of eGFP-DEK, U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cells (Ganz et al., 
2019) (Fig. 1D lower panel, Fig. S2A, B) and when DEK was expressed transiently in 
U2-OS cells (Fig. S2C). Such accumulations were not detected in eGFP-only expressing 
cells (Fig. S2D). Thus, formation of late replication-associated foci is a specific feature of 
DEK, possibly regulated by cellular state, for which the U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cell line is 
a valid reporter. We term these foci henceforth “DEK bodies”. 
To get deeper structural insight into DEK bodies and their spatial relation to active 
replication sites we turned to super-resolution imaging. We visualized firstly the granular 
fine structure of endogenous DEK bodies in MCF10A cells by Stimulated Emission 
Depletion  (STED)  and  single-molecule  localization  (SML)  microscopy  (Fig.  2A,  B).

Secondly, we investigated the organization of nascent DNA and replication forks within 
DEK bodies of wild-type U2-OS cells by labeling with EdU and PCNA-specific antibodies 
followed by 3D Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM). The data show that DEK, 
PCNA, and EdU signals do not colocalize but are juxtaposed within DEK bodies (Fig. 2C, 
D). Intensity line plots (Fig. 2E) highlight the close spatial proximity, which was also 
observed in primary BJ-5ta foreskin fibroblasts (Fig. S1). This result is in line with previous 
data showing that DEK is not part of the replisome but binds to nascent chromatin in the 
vicinity of the replication fork (Ganz et al., 2019). 
DEK bodies assemble at replicating heterochromatic regions  
The occurrence of DEK in a subpopulation of PCNA- and EdU-positive nuclear bodies in 
late  S-phase  let  us  hypothesize  that  DEK  accumulates  at  sites  of  replicating 
heterochromatin. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunofluorescence analyses of 
three well-established chromatin markers in S-phase cells - H3K9ac for euchromatin 
(Wang et al., 2008), H3K27me3 for facultative heterochromatin (Trojer and Reinberg, 
2007), and H3K9me3 for constitutive heterochromatin (Nakayama et al., 2001) (Fig. 3A, 
B and Fig. S3 A-C). We observed that within DEK bodies, DEK-specific signals did not 
overlap with H3K9ac labeled chromatin, were spatially juxtaposed to H3K27me3 signals, 
and colocalized with H3K9me3 (Fig. 3A), strongly suggesting that DEK bodies represent 
regions of replicating constitutive heterochromatin. This conclusion was corroborated by 
Manders’ coefficient analysis yielding the highest overlap for DEK and H3K9me3. The 
values for the coefficient M  indicating the fraction of DEK bodies containing the different 
1
modified histones were as follows: M  = 0.87 ± 0.09, M  = 0.22 ± 
1(DEK&H3K9me3) 1(DEK&H3K9ac)
0.12; and M  = 0.37 ± 0.06; with n=8 from two independent experiments (Fig. 
1(DEK&H3K27me3)
3B). Further evidence was obtained by Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) confirming direct 
interaction of DEK with H3K9me3 but not with H3K27me3 (Fig. 3C, D), while fluorescence 
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) showed a reduced mobility of DEK in the bodies 
with respect to the bulk chromatin, consistent with a high level of chromatin compaction 
in these structures (Fig. 3E-G). In line with these data, DEK bodies were associated with 
heterochromatin, in particular with H3K9me3, also in U2-OS wild type and U2-OS KI 
eGFP-DEK cells (Fig. S4).

Finally,  we  investigated  the  localization  of  DEK  bodies  with  respect  to  known 
heterochromatic compartments such as centromeres, the Barr body, and the nuclear 
periphery.  Maximum  intensity  projections  of  confocal  Z-stacks  revealed  that  the 
epigenetic mark for centromeres, the histone H3 variant CENP-A, reproducibly decorates 
DEK bodies from both sides (Fig. 4A). We did not observe spatial proximity of DEK and 
CENP-A outside of late S (Fig. 4B). A staining pattern of similar symmetry was observed 
for Xist RNA, a selective marker for the Barr body (Cerase et al., 2015) (Fig. 4C). No such 
pattern was observed in male BPH-1 cells (data not shown). Similarly, we found DEK 
bodies  in  close  proximity  of  the  nuclear  periphery  and  Lamin-A  positive  nuclear 
invaginations only in S-phase (Fig. 4D, E). Furthermore, DEK bodies corresponded to 
regions of dense chromatin, as shown by DNA staining with ToPro3 (Fig. 4F). Altogether, 
our collective microscopy data strongly support a role for DEK bodies in the replication of 
heterochromatic chromatin regions in late S-phase. 
DEK body dynamics is affected by DNA replication inhibitors 
Having assessed that DEK bodies are implicated in the replication of heterochromatin in 
fixed cells, we were interested in exploring and manipulating their dynamics in living cells. 
To this end, we transiently expressed mRFP-PCNA in U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cells via a 
PCNA chromobody plasmid and performed time-lapse imaging experiments at a spinning 
disk confocal microscope (Fig. 5A). DEK body formation was evaluated manually and 
occurred reproducibly in every cell in late S-phase. 2.7 ± 1 DEK bodies formed per cell 
and persisted for 48 ± 30 min until G2 entry (Fig. 5B, C). All DEK bodies colocalized with 
PCNA-positive replication foci, but only 45% of the latter contained DEK. A similar 
behavior was observed also in MCF10A cells transiently expressing fluorescent fusions 
of DEK and PCNA, with a higher number of DEK bodies (6.7 ± 2.2) that persisted for a 
longer time (189 ± 38 min). 82 ± 18% of DEK bodies colocalized with PCNA-marked 
replication foci in these cells (object-based analysis of 19 DEK bodies) (Fig. S5).  
To determine whether impairment of DNA replication would affect DEK body formation, 
we employed hydroxyurea (10 M), aphidicolin (200 nM) and camptothecin (100 nM), 
three well-established replication fork inhibitors acting by different mechanisms which at

these low doses slow down but do not arrest replication (Fig. 6A) (Deutzmann et al., 
2015; Vesela et al., 2017). The treatments, in particular aphidicolin and camptothecin, did 
not affect viability, but triggered accumulation of cells in G2, followed by normal mitoses 
(Fig. 6B upper panels). Of the three substances, aphidicolin showed the most prominent 
effect reducing DEK body number by 47%, and prolonging DEK body lifetime by 28%. 
Camptothecin had a similar but more moderate effect, and hydroxyurea did not alter DEK 
body dynamics (Fig.6B lower panels). The differential response to the replication stress 
inducers strongly suggests that DEK bodies are implicated in the replication of DNA 
structures particularly susceptible to aphidicolin, such as common fragile sites that in turn 
can coincide with highly repetitive heterochromatic regions like centromeres or ribosomal 
DNA (Lukusa and Fryns, 2008), in line with our data on the colocalization of DEK bodies 
with heterochromatin histone marks.  
Down-regulation of the SUMO pathway increases DEK body number in an siRNA 
screen for DEK body regulators  
As our time-lapse microscopy experiments could measure the effect of mild replication 
stress  on  DEK  body  formation,  we  chose  to  perform  an  imaging-based  unbiased 
approach to identify DEK body regulatory factors. To this end, we set up a high-throughput 
siRNA screen targeting genes from a recently published DEK interactome (Smith et al., 
2018),  DEK-related  factors  derived  from  the  literature,  and  genes  selected  from  a 
commercial library targeting the DNA damage response that responded to the gene 
ontology terms “DNA replication” and “S-phase”. The final library consisted of 332 genes 
(678 siRNAs total, at least two siRNAs per gene, Supplementary Table S1). 
Experimental conditions and a suitable image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler software 
were established in two pilot screens including aphidicolin and camptothecin as positive 
controls (Material and Methods, Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. S6). The primary 
screen targeting the chosen gene panel was performed in duplicate and a Z-score of the 
log-transformed mean number of DEK bodies per cell was calculated for each siRNA 
(Fig.  7A).  This  resulted  in  51  candidate  siRNAs  enhancing  (up-regulators)  and  29

candidates reducing DEK body numbers (down-regulators) corresponding to 44 and 28 
different genes, respectively (Fig. 7B, C). The number of DEK bodies per cell was the 
most  sensitive  and  robust  readout  for  DEK  body  formation  also  in  the  automated 
approach, reproducing the results from the manual experiments (Fig. S6D). To further 
confirm the identified hits, we conducted a low-throughput secondary screen with 28 
siRNAs (Fig. 7D). In general, the values for the Z-score obtained in this secondary screen 
were smaller and more variable, most likely due to the different, less automated imaging 
system and the manual dispensing of transfection reagents. Still, the effect of up- and 
down-regulation of DEK body number was confirmed (Fig. 7D). Importantly the secondary 
screen validated four top DEK body up-regulators from the primary screen belonging to 
the SUMO pathway, among them the E1 activating enzyme SAE1 and the E2 conjugating 
enzyme UBE2I. Our screening approach thus determined that the SUMO pathway plays 
a major role in the regulation of DEK body formation.  
DEK is a SUMO target and SUMOylation is required for the formation of DEK bodies  
As both screening approaches showed that down-regulation of the SUMOylation pathway 
resulted in the up-regulation of the number of DEK bodies in U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cells, 
we  hypothesized  that  DEK  may  be  a  target  of  SUMOylation  and  that,  in  turn,  its 
SUMOylation state may modulate the ability to form DEK bodies in late S-phase. Indeed, 
the DEK protein sequence contains a SUMOylation consensus motif ψ-K-X-E/D (Zhao et 
al., 2014) at lysine 261 (AKRE, https://sumo.biocuckoo.cn/online.php) and DEK has been 
shown to be SUMOylated under stress conditions in a mass spectrometry study of H 0 -
2 2
treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Grant, 2010). To test if DEK can be SUMOylated 
under steady-state conditions, we focused on SUMO 1 and 3, as both were strong hits in 
the screens. We first conducted co-immunoprecipitations using DEK-antibodies, showing 
direct interaction of DEK with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 (Fig. 8A). To narrow down a specific 
SUMO paralog targeting DEK, we used HeLa cells stably expressing 6xHis-SUMO-1, 
6xHis-SUMO-2, or 6xHis-SUMO-3 allowing for subsequent nickel affinity purification of 
SUMOylated factors. This approach revealed modification of DEK by all SUMOs, yet with 
the strongest activity for SUMO-3 (which also generates multimers) (Fig. 8B, C). As we

could confirm the existence of SUMOylated DEK in cells under physiological conditions, 
we were next interested to map the specific SUMOylation sites in the DEK primary 
sequence.  As  indicated  above,  DEK  harbors  one  SUMOylation  consensus  motif  at 
position lysine 261. However, mutation of this site did not yield substantial reduction in 
SUMOylation in in vitro SUMOylation assays using recombinant GST-tagged DEK as 
acceptor (Fig. S8). Therefore, we screened the DEK sequence for additional potential 
SUMOylation sites, which revealed amino acids 61, 62 and 144, 145 as suitable SUMO 
attachment sites. Interestingly, mutation of these sites individually, as was the case with 
261, did not result in a substantial reduction of SUMOylation activity on DEK (Fig. S8). 
However, DEK molecules carrying mutations at all five sites showed an 80% reduction in 
SUMOylation (Fig. 8D, E), highlighting that most of the potential SUMOylation sites were 
captured by our mutational approach. Given that we had created a DEK mutant that is 
substantially less susceptible to SUMOylation, we then investigated the ability of such a 
mutant to form DEK bodies in cells. Therefore, we established a stable cell line expressing 
this mutant as eGFP-fusion and monitored the occurrence of DEK bodies as described 
above. No DEK body formation was observed in cells expressing SUMO-less DEK (GST-
DEK SUMO mut, FIG. 8F). This result points at a complex regulation of DEK bodies by 
SUMO, where SUMOylation of DEK seems to be required for DEK body formation while 
DEK  body numbers increase  when  the  overall  SUMOylation  capacity  of  the  cell  is 
reduced. In summary, these data uncover a yet unrecognized link between SUMO and 
DEK and establish SUMOylation as a crucial regulator of DEK body formation.

Discussion 
DEK bodies reflect the formation of transient DEK multimers in the nucleus during 
late DNA replication  
We report on the discovery of DEK bodies, DNA replication-dependent focal assemblies 
of the oncoprotein DEK in the cell nucleus. DEK bodies were observed in every cell during 
mid-late S-phase in primary, immortalized and in transformed, yet non-malignant cell 
lines. This finding was somewhat surprising as the large majority of immunofluorescence 
studies have described DEK as a factor dispersed in an uniform punctuate pattern in the 
nucleus (Hu et al., 2007; Kappes et al., 2001; Matrka et al., 2015). Intriguingly, the 
existence of non-covalent DEK multimers was proposed in the past based on biochemical 
analyses  of  DEK-chromatin  complexes  (Kappes  et  al.,  2004b),  but  had  eluded 
demonstration in live cells so far. We interpret DEK bodies as the cellular correlate of 
these non-covalent multimers, whose detection by microscopy was most likely facilitated 
by fusion of DEK to GFP. This reporter has a propensity to form aggregates at high 
concentrations (Stepanenko et al., 2021) contributing to slow down the dynamics of DEK 
bodies and make them amenable to microscopic imaging. The focused inspection of high 
resolution immunofluorescence images revealed that DEK bodies are distinct sites of 
active replication containing endogenous DEK in close spatial proximity to nascent DNA 
and the replication processivity factor PCNA consistent with previous iPOND analyses 
(Alabert et al., 2014; Aranda et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 2017; Lossaint et al., 2013; Ribeyre 
et al., 2016; Sirbu et al., 2013). The number and persistence of DEK bodies varied 
substantially between MCF10-A and U2-OS cells, the former showing a more pronounced 
expression of these bodies. Unfortunately, a direct quantitative comparison of DEK bodies 
between these two cell lines is not appropriate as DEK was expressed endogenously in 
U2-OS and transiently in MFC-10A cells, and imaging was performed with different 
microscopes in different laboratories. But in both cases, DEK bodies were sparingly 
observed also in mid S-phase, probably reflecting cell-to-cell variability in replication 
timing (Zhang et al., 2017).

Previous data suggesting that DEK may occur in defined nuclear substructures included 
coimmunoprecipitation and spurious colocalization with PML (Ivanauskiene et al., 2014), 
and the redistribution to interchromatin granule clusters in the presence of deacetylase 
inhibitors (Clarey 2005, McGarvey 2000), but no link to the cell cycle or DNA replication 
was made in these studies. 
In general, the formation of nuclear bodies has emerged as an organizing principle for the 
orchestration of genome-associated functions in time and space. Different nuclear bodies 
have been described in which proteins, often together with RNAs, are sequestered and 
released  according  to  demand,  including  the  nucleolus,  nuclear  speckles  and 
paraspeckles,  PML,  Cajal  bodies,  53BP1  and  other  bodies  (Dundr,  2012).  Post-
translational modifications,  as  well as  weak  intermolecular interactions mediated  by 
intrinsically disordered protein domains, seem to play a fundamental role in the genesis 
and dynamic composition of these membrane-less nuclear condensates. It is thus not 
surprising that DEK, a DNA and RNA-binding protein carrying several post-translational 
modifications and an intrinsically disordered region (aa 170-270) is prone to form nuclear 
bodies.  
DEK bodies form at heterochromatic regions  
Our  data  provide  strong  evidence  that  DEK  bodies  are  sites  of  heterochromatin 
replication. These include their narrow window of appearance during late S-phase, the 
association with heterochromatin histone marker H3K9me3, the high level of chromatin 
compaction and the reduced mobility of DEK in bodies, and the local proximity to the Barr 
body and centromeric chromatin CENP-A. The lack of colocalization between CENP-A 
and DEK reported previously (Ivanauskiene et al., 2014) was most likely due to the fact 
that endogenous DEK bodies are transient structures visible only in late S-phase, and 
may thus escaped detection. 
The reproducibility with which DEK bodies form in consecutive cell cycles support the 
notion that they reflect a conserved and necessary passage in genome duplication. The 
striking appearance of the centromeric and Xist-specific signals as dots decorating DEK

bodies (Fig. 4A, C) are suggestive of newly replicated chromosomes tethered to these 
bodies at regions rich of secondary structures that are preferred DEK substrates in vitro, 
are  difficult  to  replicate  and  prone  to  breakage.  In  line  with  this  observation, 
downregulation of DEK resulted in the formation of anaphase bridges, the appearance of 
DNA breaks on mitotic chromosomes and of 53BP1 bodies in daughter cells (Deutzmann 
et al., 2015). While, in the latter study we described how DEK affects DNA replication 
globally, the results obtained here suggest a more specialized function of the protein, at 
specific  genomic  regions  including  the  centromere  and  possibly  other  constitutive 
heterochromatic regions. These findings may explain the relatively mild effects of DEK 
downregulation on replication fork progression as assessed by bulk fiber assays. The 
assessment of DEK´s influence on the processivity of the replication fork therefore awaits 
DNA combing experiments coupled with the detection of heterochromatic fibers. 
DEK  bodies  are  novel  players  in  the  SUMO-dependent  regulation  of 
heterochromatin replication 
DEK body up-regulating siRNAs show a remarkable enrichment in proteins involved in 
post-translational modification pathways. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) ACTL6A, 
KAT2B, TAF5L and TAF6L, histone deacetylase HDAC2, histone methyltransferases 
SUV39H1/2 and SUMOylation-related proteins UBE2I, SUMO1 and SAE1 are among the 
top hits. Acetylation of DEK by KAT2B/PCAF has been shown previously (Cleary et al., 
2005).  In  this  study,  overexpression  of  KAT2B  led  to  an  accumulation  of  DEK  in 
interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), which are nuclear domains enriched in pre-mRNA 
splicing factors. Pharmacological inhibition of KAT2B in turn, blocked the relocation of 
DEK into IGCs, opposite to the effect of downregulation of KAT2B on DEK bodies. This 
finding further underscores that DEK bodies are distinct from ICGs, which are more 
abundant (20-30 clusters per cell) and are stable during the whole interphase (Mintz et 
al., 1999).  
Here, we focused on SUMOylation as a post-translational modification that has recently 
emerged  as  a  major  regulator  of  heterochromatin  formation  and  replication.  We

substantiate the result from the siRNA screen by showing that DEK is modified by SUMO 
in cells, and that SUMO-less DEK does not form bodies. Recent data also show that 
SUV39H1  promotes  SUMOylation  and  de  novo  targeting  of  HP1α  to  pericentric 
heterochromatin, independently of its methyltransferase activity. The latter is required in 
a second step to maintain and propagate heterochromatin (Maison et al., 2016). This 
knowledge aligns well with our screening data, where downregulation of both SUV39H1 
and SUMO increase the number of DEK bodies suggesting the DEK plays a role in 
“seeding” constitutive heterochromatin after DNA replication (Maison et al., 2016). Our 
data also support and refine the conclusions from our previous study showing that DEK 
is essential for heterochromatin integrity, and has a Su(var)like activity by enhancing 
HP1α binding to H3K9me3 (Kappes et al., 2011a).  
Heterochromatin  preferentially  harbors  repetitive  sequences  causing  non-B  DNA 
secondary structures. Their replication requires specialized polymerases that can sustain 
fork progression in the presence of difficult-to-replicate regions, but on the other hand 
lack proofreading activity and are therefore error-prone and mutagenic (reviewed in (Tsao 
and Eckert, 2018)). The switch from replicative polymerase to these specialized, or 
translesion polymerases, at the replisome is regulated by ubiquitylation and SUMOylation 
(Despras et al., 2016; Mailand et al., 2013). In particular, SUMOylation is required on the 
one hand, for driving specialized polymerases to nascent DNA while, on the other hand, 
enabling  discharge  from  the  replisome  after  bypass  of  the  problematic  site  to  limit 
replication errors and prevent mutagenesis, as shown for Pol  (Despras et al., 2016; 
Guérillon et al., 2020). We hypothesize first, that DEK in bodies may participate in the 
maturation  of  nascent  heterochromatin  after  replication  involving  specialized 
polymerases and that this step requires SUMOylation of DEK, explaining why a non-
SUMOylatable mutant of DEK does not form bodies. Secondly, we interpret the increase 
in the number of DEK bodies observed after downregulation of the SUMO pathway as 
consequence of impaired turnover of these specialized replisomes and the replacement 
by proof-reading replicative polymerases. Interestingly, also Pol was reported to be 
SUMOylated at multiple sites which can substitute for each other, so that simultaneous

mutation of all SUMOylation sites was reported to be necessary to achieve dysregulation 
of the Pol dynamics (Guérillon et al., 2020).  
At present, we have no straightforward interpretation for the reduction in DEK bodies that 
seems to result from increased DNA replication stress, as highlighted by the lack of DEK 
bodies in highly cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells and in the presence of aphidicolin, and - 
to a lesser extent - camptothecin. We speculate that under these conditions replisomes 
at difficult-to-replicate-regions would be more likely to collapse leading to DNA breakage 
before chromatin maturation, thus impairing DEK body assembly. Accordingly, we found 
increased H2AX foci after DEK downregulation in a previous study (Kappes et al., 2008). 
The propensity to DNA strand break formation is a well-established feature of difficult-to-
replicate-regions such a common fragile sites (CFS) and their stability has been shown 
to depend on specialized polymerases (Bergoglio et al., 2013; Bhat et al., 2013).  
In  conclusion,  the  link  established  here  between  DEK  and  the  establishment  of 
constitutive heterochromatin during replication sheds new light on the mechanisms of 
action  of  this  so  far enigmatic  oncoprotein.  Some  of  its  pleiotropic  effects  may  be 
associated with the seeding of (constitutive) heterochromatin, a process that broadly 
impacts the cell´s epigenetic landscape and transcriptional program and is essential for 
maintaining genomic stability (Penagos-Puig and Furlan-Magaril, 2020).

Transfection and cell sorting  
For  detection  of  endogenous  PCNA,  U2-OS  KI  eGFP-DEK  or  MCF10A  cells  were 
transfected  with  a  PCNA-specific  chromobody  expression  vector  (pCCC-TagRFP, 
Chromotek)  using  Effectene  (Qiagen  U2-OS  KI  eGFP-DEK)  or  Lipofectamine  3000 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. For U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK, the 
medium was exchanged 4 h after transfection and the cells were incubated for further 20 
h before imaging. For MCF10A cells, the medium was exchanged about 12 h post-
transfection, and experiments were carried out between 24 to 48 h after transfection. For 
the generation of U2-OS cell lines stably expressing eGFP-DEK mutants, pEGFP-N1-
hDEK plasmids encoding the mutated DEK versions were transfected into U2-OS DEK 
knockout cells using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen). 3-9 days after transfection 
(depending on cell growth and viability) selection was carried out with geneticin at a final 
concentration of 200 µg/ml. To create cell lines with a uniform GFP fluorescent signal, the 
stable transfected cell lines were bulk sorted for a moderate fluorescence signal using a 
FACSAria IIIu Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). 
Immunochemical methods 
All antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 3.  
For the detection of nascent DNA MCF10A and U2-OS cells were incubated with EdU 
(10 µM) for 25 min or 10 min respectively. After fixation and washings, the incorporated 
precursor was detected with the Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit or Click-iT EdU PLUS Imaging 
Kit,  Molecular  Probes  with  Alexa  Fluor  647  or  Alexa  Fluor  594  azide  dye.  When 
necessary, nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO™-3 Iodide (Invitrogen, 1:2000). For 
immunofluorescence detection of DEK or PCNA cells were fixed with 4% PFA/PBS (20 
min) followed by quenching with 50 mM NH Cl/PBS (10 min). Cells were permeabilized 
4
in methanol (5 min, -20°C), incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min followed by incubation 
with the primary antibody dilution (diluent 1% BSA/PBS) in a dark, humid chamber 
(overnight, 4 °C). After washing with PBS for three times, cells were incubated with the 
appropriate  secondary  antibody  (diluent  1%  BSA/PBS)  in  the  dark  chamber  (1  h).

SMLM Imaging 
For the super-resolution SMLM imaging of DEK, MCF10A cells were washed with pre-
warmed PBS 3x, and fixed with formaldehyde (3,7%, methanol free). After subsequent 
blocking with blocking buffer (0,1% Triton X-100 and 3% w/v of bovine serum albumin 
(BSA)) for 1h at room temperature, samples were incubated with the primary antibody 
(overnight at +4°C). F(ab’)2-Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary 
Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 was used as secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, 
A21237, 1:250, 45min in RT). Samples were post-fixed in PFA 2% for 5 min and stored 
in PBS at +4°C until applying GLOX buffer containing a glucose oxidase-based oxygen 
scavenging system for imaging (Bates et al., 2007). A commercial N-STORM & N-SIM 
TIRF Eclipse Ti2 microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective (CFI SR HP 
Apochromat TIRF 100XC Oil, NA 1.49) was used to acquire 20000 frames at a frame rate 
of  30  ms  using  oblique  incidence  excitation  and  sCMOS  camera  (ORCA-Flash4.0, 
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Alexa Fluor 647 labeled samples were switched into dark 
state with the 647 nm laser and reactivated with the 405 nm laser. Imaging cycles 
consisted of 1 activation frame followed by 3 read-out frames. Acquisition was performed 
using the continuous STORM filter and hardware autofocus. Image reconstruction was 
performed with the NIS-Elements and N-STORM Analysis imaging software. 
Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching  
FRAP measurements were performed on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning 
microscope.  The  experiments  were  conducted  under  a  controlled  environment  in  a 
dedicated live-cell imaging chamber (5 % of CO , 37°C, 90 % humidity). Briefly, regions 
2
of interest (ROI) of 2 µm x 2 µm were selected and photobleached with 100% laser power 
(55 µW @488nm). Subsequently, fluorescence recovery was monitored for about 3 min, 
all traces were min/max normalized, averaged and the standard error was calculated. The 
parameters used for the FRAP measurement are listed in Table 1.

Image analysis 
Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and Leica LAS X F 
(Leica Microsystems GmbH). The number of DEK bodies was obtained from Z-stack 
Maximum  projections  on  which  was  performed  Find  Maxima  function  (with  the 
prominence about 80-90 depending on the level of immunofluorescence staining).  
For finding the number of DEK bodies colocalizing with PCNA DNA replication foci, the 
object-based analysis was performed by using an ImageJ plugin JaCoP (Bolte and 
Cordelieres, 2006). For the analysis of FRAP data, first the photobleached region within 
cell nucleus was cropped. After this, the mean intensity of the ROI along the time 
experiment was plotted, and the curves were combined andnormalized to the minimum 
and maximum of the combined curve. Finally, each of the curves was fit. The tau 
parameter was obtained from the average of all fits. This procedure was performed for 
the case of DEK within DEK bodies and for DEK within the other chromatin regions 
 
High-throughput siRNA screen coupled with time lapse fluorescence microscopy 
U2-OS  KI  eGFP-DEK  cells  were  transfected  with  siRNAs  by  solid-phase  reverse 
transfection (Neumann et al., 2006): For the primary screen, the customized siRNA library 
comprised 678 unique siRNAs distributed on eight 96-well plates (the complete library 
can be found in Supplementary Table 1). In each plate, four wells contained the sNEG1 
negative control, two wells the sPOLD1 (s616) positive control, two wells the sDEK 
transfection control (s15459) siRNA and three wells were left empty. The remaining wells

contained the library siRNAs in alphabetical order. Before preparing the imaging plates, 
siRNAs of the mother plate were dissolved in 33 µl ddH O to a final concentration of 3 
2
µM and stored at -20 °C 
For the pilot screen, a 3 µM dilution of each control siRNA was distributed on a 96-well 
imaging plate (see Supplementary Table 2) in technical triplicates. Plates were sealed 
directly after distribution of siRNAs and stored at -20 °C until further use.  
The following protocol was used for the coating of eight identical 96-well imaging plates 
from one unique siRNA layout. First, the siRNA plate was thawed and 5 µl of the 3 µM 
siRNA dilution were transferred into a V-shaped 96-well plate. Then, 11 µl of a mixture of 
554 µl of 0.4 M sucrose in Opti-MEM, 323 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 323 µl of ddH2O 
were distributed into another 96-well plate. 7 µl of this transfection reagent mixture were 
transferred into the previously prepared siRNA plate and mixed 8 times. After 20 min of 
incubation, 7 µl of sterile filtered 0.2% gelatin (0.45 µm pore size) were added to the wells 
and mixed 8 times. This final transfection mix was diluted 1:51 in water in several steps. 
From this diluted transfection mix, 50 µl were distributed into each well of the 8 96-well 
COC imaging plates. In 100 µl medium the final siRNA concentration per well was 7.7 
nM.  Plates  were  immediately  lyophilized  (37  °C,  1  h)  and  stored  in  plastic  boxes 
containing drying pearls. 
Cell seeding and time-lapse microscopy 
For the first four plates of the primary screen (layout no. 1-4, replicate 1), 4000 U2-OS 
GFP-DEK cells per well were seeded in 100 µl McCoy’s medium (without antibiotics) into 
the coated 96- well imaging plate using an automated cell seeding device and incubated 
for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO . For all other plates, 3500 cells were seeded because cell 
2
confluency was slightly too high in some control wells. On the day of imaging, medium 
was exchanged with 100 µl pre- warmed phenol red free CO -independent imaging 
2
medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1.5 mM L-glutamine and 2.3 g/l D-glucose. 
The full incubation IXM XLS high-content widefield microscope (Molecular Devices) was 
equipped with a PlanApochromat 20X/0.75 air objective and a sCMOS camera (4.66 
megapixels). For GFP-DEK detection a 488 nm solid-state light source, the GFP filter set

and a 690 nm laser autofocusing system were used while exposure time was set to 150 
ms. For the time lapse experiment, four imaging field of views (FOVs) per well were set 
and images acquired every 12 min for 22 h. Two replicate plates per siRNA layout were 
seeded and imaged, for layout no. 5 three replicates. For the pilot screen, 2500 – 4000 
cells per well were seeded. For the pilot screen, 200 nM APH or 100 nM CPT were added 
to the imaging medium in the designated wells 1 h prior to imaging. For the time lapse 
experiment, 4-9 imaging FOVs per well were set and images acquired every 5 - 10 min 
for 24 - 48 h. 
Image analysis using CellProfiler 
The open-source software CellProfiler (v2.1.0 (Kamentsky et al., 2011)) was used for 
automated image analysis via a remote cluster to reduce computing time. The image 
analysis pipeline encompassed background correction, nuclei segmentation, filtering of 
dead and mitotic cells, intensity-based detection of DEK bodies and tracking of nuclei via 
the minimal overlap method. 
The following steps were performed sequentially for every image of a time lapse. Images 
of the same time lapse were correlated using an object (here nuclei) tracking module. 
Then, the raw image was corrected for uneven illumination due to vignetting and for 
background fluorescence. As the effect was now limited to the corners of the image, the 
top- and leftmost 30, the rightmost 60 and the bottommost 160 pixels (px) were cropped 
(“cropped image”). The cropped image was smoothed by applying a Gaussian filter and 
a threshold was calculated automatically with the global Otsu method to identify nuclei. 
Subsequently, the cropped image was masked with the nuclei outlines and the median 
intensity of the remaining background signal was subtracted from the cropped image 
(“corrected image”). Next, nuclei were segmented similarly by applying a Gaussian filter 
and calculating the threshold with the global Otsu method. Using this mask on the 
corrected image, nuclei of dead or mitotic cells were filtered out when meeting following 
requirements: Too high standard deviation and upper quartile of intensity and too small 
nuclear area. The filtered nuclei were tracked from image to the next image within a time 
lapse using a simple overlap method with a maximum pixel distance of 15. Afterwards,

DEK bodies were identified: the corrected image was smoothed again by applying a 
Gaussian filter and DEK bodies were enhanced by performing a top-hat morphological 
operation. To avoid false-positive detection of peripheral micronuclei as DEK bodies, 
these protrusions were removed, and nuclei outlines were smoothed by performing an 
opening  morphological  operation.  DEK  bodies  were  identified  within  the  smoothed 
outlines using a manual threshold (0.004 AU) and a diameter of 3 - 10 px. Finally, for 
each image CSV files containing image, nuclei and DEK body measurements were saved 
before the next image was analyzed. Aggregation of these raw data and evaluation of 
DEK body measurements was performed with the statistical software package R. 
Data aggregation and transformation using R  
The  open-source  programming  language  R  with  additional  packages  was  used  to 
aggregate the data. The goal was to obtain a single measurement per treatments/siRNA 
from the complex, time-resolved raw data of the technical (FOVs) and biological (plates) 
replicates that can be used to score DEK body regulators. As CellProfiler tracks the nuclei 
over subsequent frames/images, these track identifiers were used to summarize relevant 
measurements such as DEK body lifetime, number of DEK bodies per track etc. We 
noticed, however, that the CellProfiler pipeline not always managed to identify DEK 
bodies in all of the nuclei within a DEK body-containing sequence. We therefore wrote a 
custom function which used the closing morphological operation to fill these gaps with the 
DEK body counts of the previous or following frame (see lines 31-46 in the R code). In 
cases where a second, shorter DEK bodies-containing sequence was detected within the 
same track, the function also served to remove these likely false-negative DEK bodies by 
keeping only the longest sequence. Additionally, a similar function was implemented to 
calculate the mean DEK body number within this longest sequence, which was used as 
the main readout to score hits (see lines 50-60 in the R code). DEK body related 
measurements were then further aggregated over FOVs to investigate the variability 
within the same siRNAs/treatments. Afterwards, the aggregated data of all replicates was 
concatenated. For the primary screen, quality control was then performed based on the 
FOV summaries. FOVs with a small integrated nuclear fluorescence intensity (very small 
and/or dark nuclei), very low cell number, blurry images and a negative slope of their

linear growth function were filtered out. Furthermore, all wells that were contaminated 
with  bacteria  or  yeast  after  the  time  lapse  (as  seen  under  a  brightfield  benchtop 
microscope) were filtered out manually. 
Lastly, Z-scores of the FOV-based summaries of the mean number of DEK bodies were 
calculated. The Z-score can be used when the data distribution is unimodal and variability 
of the control measurement (here sNEG1) does not change in between replicates (Zhang, 
2011). Therefore, the data was log (base 2)-transformed and the mean (X ) and the 
sNEG1
standard  deviation  (SD )  of  all  negative  control  (sNEG1)  FOVs  from  the  same 
sNEG1
replicate were calculated. For all FOVs of the other siRNAs of this replicate a Z-score was 
computed: 
 
The mean of all Z-scores of the same siRNA was finally calculated. By ordering this mean 
DEK body number by size it was possible to score DEK body up-regulators (highest Z-
score) and down-regulators (lowest Z-score). R code provided at https://github.com/CP-
Vogel/R-DEK-body-script.git. 
Low-throughput siRNA validation screen coupled with time-lapse fluorescence 
microscopy 
For  siRNA  delivery,  a  liquid-phase  instead  of  a  solid-phase  reverse  transfection 
procedure was employed. Transfection mixes were freshly prepared for each replicate 
before cell seeding. Validation siRNAs were picked from the primary screen mother plates 
into a V-shaped 96-well plate and diluted to 100 nM with MQ H O. Two wells were

supplied with the same validation siRNA, four wells with sNEG1 negative control, two 
wells with sDEK transfection control (s15459) siRNA and four wells were left empty. The 
new mother plate was stored at -20 °C until the day of transfection. At the day of 
transfection, 8 µl of a 1:20 dilution of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in Opti-MEM was added 
in each well of a 96-well imaging plate (Ibidi). 25 µl of diluted siRNAs were mixed with the 
pre-distributed transfection reagent dilution. After 15 min incubation, 5500 U2-OS GFP-

DEK cells in 207 µl medium (no antibiotics) were added for a final siRNA concentration 
of 10.4 nM and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. 
48 h after transfection, medium was exchanged with 200 µl of pre-warmed phenol red 
free  imaging  medium  (Hyclone,  no  antibiotics)  and  equilibrated  in  a  pre-warmed 
CellObserver  HSl  microscope  (Zeiss)  equipped  with  a  CSU-X1  spinning  disc  unit 
(Yokogawa) and a full incubator for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, humid atmosphere. Images 
were acquired with a PlanApochromat 20X/0.8 air objective, a 488 nm OPSL laser for 
GFP-DEK detection and an Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics, 512 x 512 pixels). 
Exposure time and EM gain were set to 150 ms and 700, respectively. For the time-lapse 
experiment, 6 imaging FOVs per well were set, the focus adjusted manually and images 
acquired every 12 min for 24 h. Three replicate plates were acquired in total. 
In contrast to the primary screen, the image analysis was run on a newer version of 
CellProfiler (v.2.2.0 instead of 2.1.0) and locally on a workstation instead of a remote 
cluster. The pipeline was adjusted from the primary screen to meet the needs of the new 
microscope setup. Raw data analysis was performed as for the primary screen with minor 
modifications. Calculation of Z-scores and siRNA summaries was performed as described 
above.  
Preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis 
Whole cell lysates were prepared via scraping cells in PBS containing protease inhibitors 
(Complete Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 
hot SDS lysis buffer (0.5 % SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5), incubated for 10 min at 95°C, 
centrifuged, resulting samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. 
For preparation of cell lysates for immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested in hypotonic 
buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl , 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na-
2
vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1x Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)) supplemented 
with 10 mM N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM). After centrifugation (5 min, 500 x g, 4 °C), the 
resulting cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer to 1 x 106 cells per 100 µl. For 
extraction  of  chromatin-bound  DEK,  450  mM  NaCl  and  0.5%  NP-40  was  added, 
incubated for 15 min on ice and harvested at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.

For preparation of cell lysates for nickel affinity chromatography (6xHis-SUMO pulldown), 
a previously published protocol was carried out (Tatham et al., 2009). HeLa cells stably 
expressing  6xHis-SUMO-1  (accession  number  P62165),  6xHis-SUMO-2,  (accession 
number CAG46970) or 6xHis-SUMO-3 (accession number CAA67897) as well as HeLa 
Rachel  cells  as  negative  control  were  grown  in  10  cm  cell  culture  dishes  to  80% 
confluency. Cells were harvested via scraping in 5 ml PBS containing 10 mM NEM. Crude 
cell  extracts  for  visualization of  SUMO  conjugates  were  prepared  with  1  ml  of  cell 
suspension. Crude samples were centrifuged (2 min, 1000 x g, RT), the supernatant was 
removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 µl 2x Laemmli sample buffer (200 mM 
imidazole, 5% SDS, 150 mM Tris-HCL pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.0025% bromophenol 
blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C, then mechanically disrupted by passing 
through a 20G needle 20 times using a 1-ml syringe and supplemented with 750 mM β-
mercaptoethanol. The remaining 4 ml cell suspension was centrifuged (5 min, 3000 x g, 
RT) and the pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 10 mM 
Tris, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM NEM). Samples 
were supplemented with 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5 mM imidazole and sonicated on 
ice for 40 s at medium power. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15 min, 3000 
g, RT) and the supernatant was stored at -20 °C. 
For  immunoprecipitation  all  buffers  were  supplemented  with  10  mM  NEM.  6  µl  of 
polyclonal rabbit α-DEK K-877 (Kappes et al., 2008) was used for 100 µl cell lysate. After 
30 min incubation on ice, 100 µl of a 25 % Protein A/G Plus-Agarose (SantaCruz) was 
added and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with extraction buffer (20 mM 
HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sucrose, 450 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl ), immune complexes

were eluted from the beads with 2 % SDS and 5 % β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 37 °C. 
IP samples were concentrated using methanol-chloroform protein precipitation (Wessel

Samples  were  separated  by  SDS-PAGE,  blotted  to  nitrocellulose  and  analyzed  by 
immunoblotting.

chromatography using HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The lysate was 
added to 100 µl packed volume of beads per sample. Bead slurry was pre-washed three 
times with ten bead volumes of cell lysis buffer (6 M Guanidinium-HCl, 10 mM Tris, 100 
mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100). After tumbling the mixture 
overnight at 4°C, the bead suspension was centrifuged (2 min, 750 g, RT) and the 
supernatant carefully removed. Beads were washed once with 4 ml of cell lysis buffer 
containing 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and once with 4 ml of 8.0 pH wash buffer (8 M Urea, 
10 mM Tris, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM β-
mercaptoethanol). Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with 4 ml of 6.3 pH 
wash buffer (8 M Urea, 10 mM Tris, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.3, 0.1% Triton 
X-100, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Finally, the beads were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 6.3 
pH wash buffer and then transferred to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. The wash buffer was 
completely removed after centrifugation (1 min, 6000 x g, RT) and elution of 6xHis-SUMO 
proteins was performed with 100 µl of elution buffer (200 mM imidazole, 5% SDS, 150 
mM Tris-HCL pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 720 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% bromophenol 
blue) per sample. The beads were boiled for 2 min at 95°C and then incubated for 20 min 
at RT. The eluted fraction and the crude cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, 
blotted to nitrocellulose and analyzed by immunoblotting. 
For analysis of whole cell lysates 40 µg of protein were loaded onto a 12 % SDS gel and 
separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane 
using semi-dry Western blotting.  
For analysis of eluted 6xHis-SUMO proteins 100 µl of eluted fraction and input/crude 
samples were loaded onto a 10 % SDS gel and separated by electrophoresis. Proteins 
were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using wet Western blotting.  
DEK-IP eluates were separated on a 12.5 % SDS gel. Membranes were blocked in 5 % 
milk/TBS-T and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C under mild agitation 
(anti-DEK  K-877).  Membranes  were  washed  and  incubated  with  HRP-conjugated

Healthcare). Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescent detection with ECL Prime 
Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham RPN2232). 
 
Site-directed mutagenesis: 
Nucleobase  mutations  of  the  DEK  sequence  were  introduced  using  an  improved 
QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Zheng et al., 2004). The pEGFP-N1-
hDEK plasmid (DEK WT sequence inserted into eGFP reporter plasmid “peGFP-N1”; 
Addgene  6085-1)  was  used  as  a  template  for  mutagenesis  PCR.  The  potential 
SUMOylation site 1 (bases 181 – 186) and the SUMO consensus motif (bases 778 – 789) 
were mutated using overlapping primers containing the desired base change. For the 
SUMOylation site 1 two codons were mutated (lysines 61 and 62 to alanine) in two rounds 
of  mutagenesis.  For  the  SUMO  consensus  motif  one  round  of  mutagenesis  was 
performed (lysine 261 to alanine). For SUMO consensus motif mutation, the plasmid DNA 
was denatured prior to the PCR using 0.2 M NaOH to reduce the amount of colonies 
containing unmutated wildtype-plasmid after transformation. Primer sequences are listed 
in Supplementary Table S4. 
 
Expression and purification of recombinant GST-tagged proteins from E. coli: 
The mutated DEK sequences (DEK SUMOmut 61-62, 144, 145 or 261) were inserted into 
a GST expression plasmid (pGEX 4T-1), transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) and purified as described before (Ganz et al., 2019). Briefly, protein 
expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1.5 h. Bacteria were 
harvested via centrifugation at 4600 g for15 min at4°C andresuspended in resuspension 
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (PH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and frozen in 
liquid nitrogen. After thawing, bacteria were sonicated on ice and 0.5 % NP-40 (Sigma-

B. Colocalization analysis of PCNA and DEK bodies in U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cells. Scale 
bar: 10 μm. Representative images are shown, and intensity profile was analyzed along 
the white line displayed in the right panel.  
C. DEK body formation is independent of the DEK expression level. U2-OS wild type cells 
were  transfected  with  plasmids  either  coding  for  pEGFP-N1-hDEK  or  pENmRFP-
PCNAL2 or double transfected with both plasmids and incubated for 24 h for maximal 
protein  expression.  U2-OS  KI  eGFP-DEK  cells  were  transfected  with  pEN-mRFP-
PCNAL2 only. Cells were monitored for 24 h (37°C, 5% CO ). Concomitant with DEK foci 
2
formation,  relocation  of  RFP-PCNA  (magenta)  can  be  detected  both  in  transiently 
transfected cells and in the stable cell line. Single transfected cells (upper two panels) 
serve as control cells. Scale bar: 10 μm.  
D. DEK foci formation is not an eGFP artifact. U2-OS cells were double transfected with 
pEGFP-C1 and pENmRFP-PCNAL2 and incubated for 24 h. During RFP-PCNA body 
formation, an equally distributed eGFP signal can be visualized. Scale bar: 10 μm.

Supplementary Figure S6: Design of a high-throughput siRNA screening approach 
for the identification of DEK body regulators. 
A. Schematic of the experimental protocols used for the siRNA screens. The pilot and 
primary screens relied on automated procedures and solid-phase reverse transfection of 
the siRNAs. Imaging was performed with a high-content widefield microscope. For the 
validation screen, cells and transfection reagents were dispensed manually. Imaging was 
performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope with an automated stage. Two pilot 
screens with slightly different imaging conditions were performed to optimize imaging 
parameters. The primary screens were performed in duplicate, and the validation screen 
in triplicate.

B. Main steps of the image analysis pipeline. Example images of cells transfected with a 
negative control siRNA are shown. Nuclei with detected DEK bodies are outlined in red, 
nuclei that passed quality control in white. Nuclei that were rejected because of cells were 
dead or mitotic are not outlined. DEK bodies are encircled in red. Scale bar: 20 μm.  
C. Scheme of the gap-filling algorithm used after image analysis. The algorithm removed 
frames in which detection of DEK bodies within one track failed (false negatives), and 
sorted out frames in which foci were detected in one frame only (false positives). 
D. Quantification of DEK body parameters in image series from one of the pilot screens 
processed as in (A) and (C). Calculations were done using R. Violin plots display the 
mean number of DEK bodies per cell (left panel), and the length of the time windows in 
which  DEK  bodies  appeared  (DEK  body  lifetime,  right  panel)  for  the  indicated 
treatments/siRNAs. In total, image data from 12 fields of view (4 positions per well, 3 wells 
per condition), each containing several tracks, were evaluated. Values from tracks within 
a field of view were averaged. The violin plot represents the density distribution of these 
averages, the black line indicates the median, the box the interquartile range (IQR) and 
the whiskers the IQR ± 1.5. 
E. Representative exemplary images of U2-OS KI eGFP-DEK cells treated with sNEG1, 
sDEK and the DEK body up-regulating siRNA sUBE2I and the down-regulating siRNA 
sRPA1. Images were taken at a spinning disk confocal microscope. Scale bar: 10 μm.

Supplementary  Figure  S7:  SUMO1/3  siRNAs  are  effective  in  down-regulating 
SUMO1/3 protein levels. 
A. Western blot analysis of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3/4 protein levels after siRNA-mediated 
knockdown of gene expression. Whole cell lysates from siRNA-transfected U2OS KI 
eGFP-DEK cells were subjected to Western blotting using SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-
specific antibodies, respectively. As negative control the sNEG1 siRNA was used, PCNA 
served as loading control. Quantified SUMO signals are marked with an arrow. The 
experiment was performed once. 
B. Densitometric quantification of (A). SUMO-specific signals were normalized to PCNA 
and are plotted as percentage of their respective controls (PCNA).

Supplementary Figure S8: Mutation of individual DEK SUMOylation sites does not 
lead to reduced DEK SUMOylation in vitro.  
Samples containing recombinant GST-tagged DEK WT, mutant, or GST only proteins as 
indicated were subjected to in vitro SUMOylation assays as described in Fig. 8. Proteins 
were  detected  with  DEK-,  GST-,  and  SUMO-specific  antibodies.  The  black  arrow 
indicates GST-DEK signals, red arrows the mono- and di-SUMOylated variants.
