Abstract
Atomistic-level investigation of olfactory receptors (ORs) is a challenging task due
totheexperimental/computationaldifficultiesinthestructuraldetermination/prediction
for members of this family of G-protein coupled receptors. Here we have developed
a protocol that performs a series of molecular dynamics simulations from a set of
structures predicted de novo by recent machine learning algorithms and apply it to a
well-studiedreceptor,thehumanOR51E2. Ourstudydemonstratestheneedforexten-
sive simulations to refine and validate such models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
need for the sodium ion at a binding site near D2.50 and E3.39 to stabilize the inactive
state of the receptor. Considering the conservation of these two acidic residues across
human ORs, we surmise this requirement also applies to the other ∼400 members of
this family.
Olfactory receptors (ORs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that
plays a crucial role in the sense of smell.1 The human genome encodes for approximately

800 GPCRs, out of which 50% are ORs.2 Although initially identified in the nose, ORs are
expressedindifferentpartsofthebody.3,4 Theinvestigationofthephysiologicalrolesofthese
extranasal ORs, as well as their possible involvement in pathological conditions, is attracting
a growing interest.5,6 Moreover, given that GPCRs are the target of ∼34% of FDA-approved
drugs7 and the wide range of biologically active molecules binding to ORs,8 these receptors
are being explored as potential novel drug targets.9,10 However, the lack of high-resolution
structures for ORs has hindered the understanding of their functional mechanisms and the
development of OR-targeting drugs.
Recently, the field of computational biology has made significant strides in protein struc-
ture prediction, following the development of AlphaFold2,11 a deep learning(DL)-based al-
gorithm that can predict the 3D structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences
with high accuracy. The success of AlphaFold2 and other machine learning(ML)-based algo-
rithmshasprovidedapowerfultooltostudyproteinstructureandfunction.12–14 Nonetheless,
structural prediction of GPCRs, including ORs, still presents challenges. In particular, the
algorithm predicts a single structure, despite multiple conformational states are possible
for GPCRs,15,16 and higher average confidence scores are obtained for proteins with close
homologs in the training PDB set,17 which is not the case for ORs.
To verify the reliability of an out-of-the-box in silico approach to predict OR structures
and dynamics, we tested a set of models generated with six different predictors, followed by
sub-microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We chose to focus on the human ol-
factory receptor 51E2 (hOR51E2), associated to prostate cancer, because it has been widely
studied, both experimentally and computationally (using a homology model).18 Based on
our test case, we propose a protocol to build reliable models of inactive, sodium-bound OR
structures.
Structure prediction. A set of six structural models of hOR51E2 was generated via
homology modeling and ML-based prediction algorithms. For homology modeling, we re-

lied on the SwissModel (SM) webserver,19 while for ML-based prediction, we considered
AlphaFold (AF),11,20 RoseTTAFold (RF),21 OmegaFold (OF),22 and ESMFold (EF).23 As a
last candidate, we considered a model of the receptor in its inactive state (AF ), generated
in
with AlphaFold-MultiState.15,24 For all the predictors considered, we tried to use the models
already available to the public (i.e., without directly using the ML algorithm or modifying
the default parameters – see details in the Supporting Information).
Models without Sodium ion in its Binding Site. For the first set of MD runs,
we submitted the starting configurations (solvated and embedded in a POPC lipid bilayer)
as set up by the CHARMM-GUI25 webserver (see the Methods section and the Supporting
Information). During the equilibration, while the receptor and the membrane configurations
were maintained in the presence of restraints, when the system was left unconstrained we
observed in all cases at least a partial rearrangement of the transmembrane helices and their
interfaces.
Interestingly, even before removal of the restraints on the protein structure, the interior of
the receptor is flooded with water molecules passing from the intracellular to the extracel-
lular part (Figure 1). During the last 500 ns of unconstrained simulation, the amount of
flowing water increases, destabilizing the interaction network that keeps TM6 and TM7 close
together, thus increasing the spacing (from 7−9 ˚A to 13−15 ˚A) between them and finally
breaking the helical bundle fold.
One notable exception was represented by the SM structure. After ∼200 ns of unrestrained
simulation, a sodium ion bound to the receptor, occupying the known ion binding pocket in
class A GPCRs, close to D2.50 (D69 in hOR51E2). In addition, E1103.39 also participated in
the coordination of the the Na+ ion. After this event, the structure appeared much more
stable (despite the already broken fold). This suggests that a sodium-bound inactive struc-
ture might be more stable than an ion-devoid configuration and thus make us consider the
possibility of positioning such an ion in the Na+ binding pocket from the beginning of the
MD protocol.

Figure 1: Opening of the TM6-TM7 interface in absence of sodium, exemplified here for
the AF model. In all the simulations without a sodium ion bound to the receptor, the
interface between TM6 and TM7 is disrupted (red-contoured arrows) and thus the receptor
changes between a closed conformation (cyan) at the end of the restrained equilibration to
a completely open conformation (lilac) after unrestrained MD.
Models with Sodium in its Binding Site. In the second set of runs, we followed the
same protocol but positioning a sodium ion close to the ion binding pocket in the vicinity of
D692.50. In all the 18 simulations (6 systems × 3 replicas per system), we observed a better
preservation of the initial fold, with an RMSD of the heavy atoms around 5 ˚A (see Figure S2
in the SI), and the inactive conformation is maintained, as shown by the A100 descriptor26
(see Figure S1). Despite this qualitative change in the stability of the fold compared to the
simulations without bound Na+, the sodium-bound simulations started from EF, RF, and
SM configurations still showed, in all replicas, water passing from the intracellular to the
extracellular part through the receptor, resulting in disruption of the interface between the
transmembrane helices, mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions.

Considering the OF and AF models, water did not pass from the intracellular part to the
transmembrane part of the receptor in one and two replicas out of three, respectively, main-
taining the initial fold and the TM6-TM7 distance through the whole 500 ns simulations.
Finally, for AF all the 3 runs maintained the original configuration (the complete list can
in
be found in Table S2 in the Supporting Information).
To highlight differences and similarities in the fold suggested by different structure pre-
dictors, we performed a cluster analysis of the simulations. In particular, we concatenated
all the MD trajectories and calculated the reciprocal RMSD of all the frames (Figure 2),
considering the heavy atoms of the transmembrane helices only and ignoring the extra- and
intracellular loops, which are less stable and usually predicted with a smaller confidence.27–29
Then, clustering was performed with the gromos method,30 as implemented in GROMACS,
using an RMSD cutoff of 2.5 ˚A. From the cluster analysis we can make two observations: (i)

receptor configurations. Left, cluster population; right, representative structures of clusters
1-5, with TM6 and TM7 helices colored according to the starting model.
the three most stable models –AF , AF, and OF– belong to two different clusters (1 and 4 in

the exception of cluster 1, where part of RF and whole AF and OF trajectories are classified

together). Therefore, upon refinement with MD, the different structure prediction methods
return significantly different conformations in the transmembrane part of the receptor, even
though the helical bundle should be less prone to errors in the structure prediction (and thus
more stable). Interestingly, RF (which unfolds during the simulation) overlaps, at least in
part, with the conformations sampled in the AF and OF simulations (see cluster 1 in Figure
2). In general, AF and OF seem to generate similar initial and MD-refined structures, that,
considered together, are stable in three out of six simulations.

ular, the AF and AF/OF structures have almost the same TM7 residues involved in the
in
interhelical contacts (Y2797.40, I2867.48, I2907.52), while for TM6 the only residue identified
as interacting in both models is V2466.43. From a practical point of view, TM6 appears to be
shifted by 1-2 residues in the structural alignment of the two models, similarly to what was
observed in a recent work on another chemosensory receptor, TAS2R14,32 when comparing
two models built with AlphaFold and I-TASSER, respectively.33
This observation exemplifies that, although the global differences between structures gener-
ated with different predictors might seem minimal, small local differences can still result in
significant changes and thus in misleading predictions regarding structure-function relation-
ships.
In conclusion, we set up a protocol to equilibrate and test models of olfactory receptors
in their inactive state embedded in a POPC membrane. We can highlight four main ob-
servations from the protocol: (i) as already suggested in previous works,34–36 the reliability
of structures should be tested extensively by MD simulations; (ii) de novo structural deter-
mination can lead to significantly different predictions in presence of a multi-state system
(see AF vs. AF ); (iii) the absence of conserved motifs between human ORs and other
in
class A GPCRs, especially for TM6,37 can lead to gross errors in structure reconstruction;
and (iv) for hOR51E2 in its inactive state –but this is most probably valid for a large
set of ORs– the presence of sodium in its binding pocket is crucial for the stabilization
of its fold. Sodium binding to hOR51E2 can be attributed to the presence of two nega-
tively charged residues, D692.50 and E1103.39. The first one is a known site for ion binding
conserved in class A GPCRs, while the second position is usually occupied by S in non-
olfactory class A GPCRs.38 Instead, 93% of human ORs contain Asp/Glu at both positions
2.50 and 3.39 (see Figure S3). Residue conservation in these sites can suggest a coevolu-
tionary feature39 supporting the structural stability role of Na+ ion binding, as empirically
observed by us. In line with this hypothesis, the presence of sodium in that position is

also foreseen for hOR51E2 by the ML-based protein-ligand binding predictor, AlphaFill40
(see https://alphafill.eu/model?id=Q9H255). As a further indirect validation, a recent ex-
perimental work41 showed that mutation of E3.39 enhances the in vitro expression of ORs,
further supporting the structural and functional importance of this residue. As pointed out
by a recent commentary,42 de novo structure determination is dramatically limited by the
“single answer problem”: predictors return a single structure that is, following the training,
the most probable candidate. From a general point of view, this can be correct only for
single-state proteins, while here (and in the majority of the biologically-relevant cases) our
target GPCR has a set of different conformational states. This problem can be solved (or
attenuated) taking particular care of the structural knowledge that the algorithm employs
to perform its prediction. In the Heo and Feig15 or del Alamo et al.16 approaches, this is
accomplished by limiting the training set to a single state (here GPCR experimental struc-
tures annotated to be in the inactive state), to maximize the chances of a correct prediction.
The majority of the de novo structure determination algorithms need a properly aligned
multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In the case of GPCRs, and in particular ORs, special
care needs to be taken when generating such MSA, especially in the absence of known con-
served motifs. In particular, ORs lack the “rotamer toggle switch” involving W6.48 present
on helix TM6 in non-olfactory class A GPCRs,37 but contain Y/F at the 6.48 position.43
Such divergence (and possible consequent MSA mismatch) may result in different structural
predictions. Some of these models seem to be not good enough, as evidenced by the stability
(or lack thereof) of the predicted fold of the system in MD simulations. One possible way to
overcome this problem can be represented by the use of manually-curated MSA based also
on structural information and/or in the training of ML weights to target specific GPCRs
subfamilies in their structure predictions.
Finally, during the writing of the manuscript, a preprint was published44 presenting the
first ever human OR structure determined experimentally, and coincidentally the structure
corresponds to a construct based on the hOR51E2 sequence in complex with an agonist

deposited to the Protein Data Bank and thus we cannot make a direct comparison between
our AFin or AF/OF inactive models and the agonist-bound, active cryo-EM structure. In
the future we plan to integrate this structural information to check our findings and build a
better MSA for future structural predictions of olfactory receptors.
Methods
System preparation
We preprocessed all the structures obtained using the Protein Preparation Wizard imple-
mented in Schr¨odinger Maestro 2022-3,45 which automatically assigns the amino acid pro-
tonation states. Two exceptions were represented by D692.50 and E1103.39, that were kept
in their charged state. All the structures prepared were further processed via the interface
of CHARMM-GUI.25,46 First, we built a disulfide bond between C963.25 and C17845.50, then
we defined a cubic box with dimensions 100×100×120˚A3, with the receptor embedded in
a POPC lipid bilayer. The membrane and the receptor were solvated in water with a NaCl
concentration of 0.15 M, in line with standard experimental and physiological conditions for
GPCRs. The protein, lipids, and ions were parameterized using the CHARMM36m force
field,47 while water was described with the TIP3P48 model.
