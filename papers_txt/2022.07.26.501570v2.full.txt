Abstract 
 
Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 are globally dominant and infection rates are very high in 
children. We determined immune responses following Omicron BA.1/2 infection in children 
aged 6-14 years and related this to prior and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. 
Primary  Omicron  infection  elicited  a  weak  antibody  response  with  poor  functional 
neutralizing antibodies. Subsequent Omicron reinfection or COVID-19 vaccination elicited 
increased  antibody  titres  with  broad  neutralisation  of  Omicron  subvariants.  Prior  pre-
Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or vaccination primed for robust antibody responses 
following Omicron infection but these remained primarily focussed against ancestral variants. 
Primary Omicron infection thus elicits a weak antibody response in children which is boosted 
after reinfection or vaccination. Cellular responses were robust and broadly equivalent in all 
groups,  providing  protection  against  severe  disease  irrespective  of  SARS-CoV-2  variant. 
Immunological imprinting is likely to act as an important determinant of long-term humoral 
immunity, the future clinical importance of which is unknown.

Introduction 
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) marked a major shift in the 
COVID-19  pandemic.  The  acquisition  of  multiple  mutations,  primarily  within  the  spike 
receptor binding domain (RBD), enhanced Omicron infectivity and led to substantial evasion 
of antibody responses elicited from prior infection or vaccination (1-3). As such, the variant 
demonstrated remarkable capacity to outcompete pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 and became the 
dominant variant globally. 
Omicron infection rates have been high in all age groups irrespective of prior infection or 
vaccination status but have been particularly notable in children (4). Reinfection with 
Omicron subvariants is also observed (5) and protection against reinfection appears lower 
than was seen in children following infection with pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 (6). Studies of 
children who have been infected with pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus or have undergone 
vaccination reveals relatively low antibody binding to Omicron, in a similar pattern to that 
seen in adults (1, 7-9). Less is known regarding the nature of the immune response elicited 
by primary Omicron infection in this age group, although low antibody responses have been 
reported (12) and concur with similar findings in adults (10, 11). Prior infection status with 
pre-Omicron variants is also suggested to be an important determinant of response to 
Omicron in adults (7, 11, 12). 
Profound differences are observed in the age-dependency of the immune response against 
SARS-CoV-2.  Infections  are  generally  mild  or  asymptomatic  in  children  and  potential 
determinants of this may include increased expression of IFN-response genes within the 
mucosal epithelium and enhanced innate immune responses (13, 14). Reassuringly, children 
develop robust systemic adaptive immune responses against pre-Omicron variants, even

after asymptomatic infection (15), with increased clonality compared to adults (14), although 
it is not known if similar immune responses will be observed after Omicron infection.  
Here we studied antibody and cellular immunity in children following a recent Omicron 
infection. Furthermore, we related immune response to prior infection or vaccination and 
also assessed the subsequent impact of reinfection or vaccination. Primary Omicron infection 
was weakly immunogenic whilst the profile of humoral response was markedly influenced by 
prior  infection  or  vaccination  and  matured  substantially  following  reinfection.  Cellular 
immunity was robust in all cases. These data have important implications for understanding 
the  immune  responses  against  SARS-CoV-2  in  children  and  guiding  optimal  immune 
protection.

RESULTS  
Primary Omicron infection in children elicits low antibody titre with poor neutralisation 
activity  
Blood samples from the sKIDS (n=29) and Born in Bradford (n=14) cohort studies were 
available from 43 unvaccinated children who had recently tested positive for Omicron BA.1/2 
infection (Extended Data Figure 1; Extended Data Table 1). The sKIDs study of children aged 
6-14 years (16) and the Born in Bradford (BiB) study of children aged 8-15 years are blood 
sampling studies of children during the COVID-19 pandemic and their design and sampling 
dates are explained fully in the Methods section (17).  
Initial  studies  were  undertaken  to  assess  how  antibody  responses  following  Omicron 
compared in children in whom this represented their primary SARS-CoV-2 infection or those 
who had previously had a pre-Omicron infection. Serological samples prior to the Omicron 
infection were available from 15 children of whom 4 were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative (primary 
infection) and 11 seropositive (secondary infection). Primary Omicron infection elicited low 
antibody titres against both the ancestral spike and RBD domains (Figure 1A, Extended Data 
Figure 2A), consistent with previous reports (18). Titres against Delta variant were high in one 
child, likely due to subclinical Delta infection between blood sampling, and as such this was 
regarded as a secondary infection (Extended Data Figure 2A). In contrast to the profile of 
primary infection, all secondary Omicron infections elicited a substantially higher antibody 
response.  
This bimodal profile of antibody response was also apparent across the total cohort of 43 
children with recent Omicron infection and was therefore used to define primary (n=20) and 
secondary (n=23) infection (Figure 1B, Extended Data Figure 2B). Due to the cross-sectional

this did not impact on antibody titre (Extended Data Figure 3A).

The magnitude and relative antibody response to both the ancestral or Omicron BA.1 
infection was then determined following primary or secondary infection (Figure 1C, Extended 
Data Figure 4). Primary Omicron infection elicited broadly equivalent antibody responses 
against all variants although these were of low titre. Notably, Omicron-specific titres did not 
exceed those seen in historical samples following infection with a pre-Omicron variant 
(Extended Data Figure 4). In contrast, antibody responses after secondary Omicron infection 
were 24-fold and 12-fold higher against ancestral and Omicron BA.1 spike (Extended Data 
Table 2). 
Functional humoral immunity was assessed with a pseudovirus-based neutralisation assay 
following primary (n=20) or secondary (n=21) Omicron infection.  Neutralisation capacity was 
low following primary infection and it was notable that 25% and 65% of children did not have 
a measurable neutralisation titre against BA.1 or BA.2 respectively. In contrast, neutralisation 
was robust following secondary infection (Figure 1D, E).  
These data show that primary Omicron infection in children elicits a low titre antibody 
response with poor neutralising activity. In contrast, prior infection with a pre-Omicron virus 
primes the immune system to develop robust humoral immunity to all viral variants following 
Omicron infection.

Re-infection  or  COVID-19  vaccination  markedly  boosts  antibody  responses  following 
primary Omicron infection 
The  endemic  human  coronaviruses  OC43,  HKU-1,  229E  and  NL63  (HCoV)  are  common 
aetiological agents of upper respiratory tract infection in children and repeated infection acts 
to incrementally elevate virus-specific antibody titres (19). As such, we next assessed whether 
an Omicron reinfection could similarly act to boost humoral immunity following primary 
Omicron  infection.  The  serological  response  to  COVID-19  vaccination  following  primary 
infection was also determined. 
Prospective follow-up serum samples were obtained from 24 unvaccinated children with prior 
serological evidence of primary Omicron infection . Omicron reinfection was identified on the 
basis of a >2-fold increase in spike-specific antibody titre, similar to previous reports of HCoV 
epidemiology (20). Reinfection was observed in 13 children (54%), consistent with reported 
reinfection rates following primary Omicron infection (5).  Spike-specific antibody titres 
increased markedly following Omicron reinfection (>0.05, Kruskal Wallis test, with Dunn’s 
correction) with titres against BA.1 increasing 10-fold (Extended Data Table 2). 
Samples were also obtained from 11 children who had received a single dose of BNT162b2 
vaccine following primary Omicron infection. A strong boosting effect was seen with BA.1-
specific titres increasing by 115-fold following vaccination (>0.0001, Kruskal Wallis test, with 
Dunn’s correction; Extended Data Table 2; Extended Data Figure 4C).  
The magnitude of antibody response and relative neutralisation activity was then determined 
against ancestral spike and Omicron subvariants following primary Omicron (n=20), Omicron 
reinfection (n=13) or vaccination after primary infection (n=10). Antibody levels (Figure 2A)

and neutralisation capacity (Figure 2B) were substantially enhanced against all variants 
following reinfection or vaccination.  
These  findings  indicate  that  a  second  SARS-CoV-2  antigen  challenge  following  primary 
Omicron infection, either in the form of reinfection or vaccination, markedly boosts spike-
specific antibody magnitude and function against current Omicron subvariants.

(A)  Antibody levels specific for spike from Wuhan-Hu-1, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 were 
determined in children following primary BA.1/2 Omicron infection (green; n=19), Omicron reinfection 
(purple; n=13) and COVID-19 vaccination (blue; n=11) after primary BA.1/2 infection.

Primary vaccination elicits antibodies against Omicron which are not enhanced following 
breakthrough Omicron infection  
15 children within the cohort had received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines prior to emergence of 
Omicron. As the vaccine contains the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike we next assessed Omicron-specific 
antibody titre in this cohort. Additionally, sera were obtained from 6 children with an Omicron 
breakthrough infection after vaccination. 10/15 and 4/6 children, respectively, had received 
two BNT162b2 vaccine doses. 
Vaccines were strongly immunogenic and Omicron-specific antibody responses following one 
or two vaccine doses were 21-fold and 40-fold higher than seen after primary natural 
infection. Of note, prior infection history was not known and it is possible that some children 
had been naturally infected prior to vaccination. Antibody responses following Omicron 
breakthrough infection after vaccination were next assessed and seen to be comparable to 
those seen in the total vaccine group with no evidence of boosting from recent infection,

potentially due to a ceiling effect on antibody titre (Figure 3A; Extended Data Figure 4D-E). 
Matched pre-infection samples were not available from children with breakthrough infection.   
Neutralisation titres were also similar between the two groups and comparable to those seen 
following dual-Omicron infection (Figure 3B).  
These data show that primary series vaccination in children induces an Omicron-specific 
antibody response that is higher than seen after Omicron secondary infection whilst Omicron 
breakthrough infection does not appear to further enhance humoral immunity.

Initial Omicron or pre-Omicron variant challenge determines the long-term balance of 
antibody binding  
We next determined how an initial infection with Omicron or a pre-Omicron virus acted to 
determine the relative balance of antibody binding against these two major viral lineages and 
to what extent this was modulated by subsequent challenge with Omicron re-infection or 
vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein.  
The relative ratio of antibody binding against Omicron or pre-Omicron Wuhan-Hu-1 spike was 
0.7 following primary Omicron infection indicating broadly equivalent response. This value 
increased slightly to 0.9 following Omicron reinfection. Of note, the ratio increased to 1.3 
following vaccination showing that vaccine challenge with pre-Omicron spike could not 
deviate antibody responses away from Omicron recognition (Figure 4A,B). 
A very different pattern was observed in children who had initial infection with pre-Omicron 
virus. Here the Omicron:pre-Omicron binding ratio was only 0.14 following primary infection, 
indicating  strong  deviation  of  recognition  towards  ancestral  spike.  This  increased  only 
modestly to 0.38 following Omicron infection. A similar profile was seen in children following 
primary vaccination or Omicron breakthrough infection with values of 0.34 in both cases 
(Figure 4A,B).

These data demonstrate that immune imprinting by the primary viral or vaccine exposure 
determines the profile of the antibody response following subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses are similar following differential primary SARS-CoV-
2 exposure 
T cell responses are critical in the control of SARS-CoV-2 but have not yet been assessed in 
children following Omicron infection. Importantly, spike-specific cellular responses were 
present in 94% (16/17) of children following primary Omicron infection (Figure 5A). T cell 
responses were also observed in all children following secondary Omicron infection and the 
magnitude  was  broadly  equivalent  (Figure  5B).  Furthermore,  cellular  immunity  was 
comparable against peptide pools from either the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 or Omicron BA.1 
spike protein. Omicron-specific cellular immunity was also assessed in historical samples from 
5 children who had been infected with pre-Omicron variant, and again, no difference was 
seen in the magnitude of ancestral or Omicron-specific response (Figure 5C). As such, T cell 
immunity against Omicron is comparable following infection with either Omicron or pre-
Omicron virus.  Analysis of vaccinated children showed cellular responses in 92% of donors 
(17/19) and again the magnitude was comparable to that seen following natural infection 
(Figure 5D).  
These data show that a SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular response develops robustly following 
primary Omicron infection and is broadly cross-reactive against Omicron and pre-Omicron

Discussion 
Omicron SARS-CoV-2 is now an endemic infection and it is important to understand immune 
responses following infection in children. Our findings highlight a range of unique features 
regarding  Omicron-specific  immune  responses  that  have  potential  implications  for  the 
trajectory of the pandemic and future vaccine strategies in this age group. 
We initially characterised the immune response following primary Omicron infection where 
a striking feature was the low magnitude and functional quality of the antibody response. 
Indeed, a quarter of children failed to demonstrate neutralisation activity against BA.1 despite 
recent infection, and this concurs with other recent findings (12). These data explain poor 
protection against reinfection and it was noteworthy that 54% showed serological evidence 
of re-infection within 3 months, a time period which encompassed emergence of the BA.4/5 
subvariants (5). A pattern of frequent reinfection is also seen with the four endemic alpha- 
and  beta-HCoV  which  circulate  widely  and  generally  elicit  mild  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection in children (20, 21). Omicron also preferentially replicates within the upper airways 
and this may underpin a somewhat less severe clinical profile (22-25) and relatively muted 
humoral response (26).   
Although primary HCoV infections elicit modest antibody responses that are unable to 
prevent  recurrent  infection  (19,  21,  27,  28),  repeated  infections  progressively  drive 
maturation of the antibody response which typically achieves adult levels towards the onset 
of puberty (19, 27, 28). As such we were interested to assess the immunological impact of 
Omicron reinfection and found that this enhanced antibody titres and neutralisation activity 
by 6-fold. We were also able to assess the impact of second antigen challenge through 
vaccination and the observed marked improvement in humoral immunity against all variants 
is encouraging for potential future protection (12).

Primary infection with a pre-Omicron virus elicited much stronger humoral immunity against 
the ancestral virus but notably antibody responses against Omicron spike were comparable 
to those seen in children after primary Omicron infection. A secondary infection with Omicron 
in these children delivered a particularly strong antibody boost with impressive neutralisation 
and exceeded values observed with dual Omicron infection. Pre-Omicron viruses are thus 
strongly immunogenic for humoral immunity in children and it is interesting to speculate that 
this may contribute to the development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) 
which can be associated with auto-antibody production (29).   
COVID-19 vaccines are now deployed widely in children and initial vaccination also elicited 
particularly strong antibody responses. Indeed, a single vaccine dose elicited values that were 
higher than seen following natural dual infection and this value was doubled following a 
second  dose  (Figure  6),  revealing  potent  vaccine  immunogenicity  in  children  despite 
incomplete clinical protection against infection (5, 30). 
Immune imprinting can limit the capacity to respond to variant antigen challenge (31-33) and 
is  of  considerable  concern  for  long-term  protection  against  SARS-CoV-2  variants.  Our 
prospective assessment of antibody specificity allowed a unique opportunity to address this 
question and we find that immune imprinting has a profound effect on long term humoral 
immunity in children. In particular, those who initially experience Omicron infection have a 
comparable relative antibody response against Omicron and ancestral variants following 
primary infection and this pattern is maintained following subsequent challenge with either 
Omicron (reinfection) or ancestral (vaccination) spike. This profile differs somewhat from a 
predominant Omicron-focussed antibody response reported in adults following primary 
infection  (11). In contrast, those who are initially exposed through pre-Omicron infection or

vaccine develop humoral immunity deviated markedly towards the ancestral spike protein 
and this profile also remains broadly stable following challenge with Omicron secondary 
infection or breakthrough infection after vaccination (Figure 6). This profile of ‘antigenic 
seniority’ is also seen following primary influenza infection and results in lifelong imprinting 
of immune responses that can impact clinical protection against influenza A subtypes many 
decades later (34, 35) . Our findings show that similar imprinting of antigenic seniority occurs 
following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, the future consequence of which is currently 
unknown. 
However,  it  is  reassuring  that  Omicron-specific  antibody  and  neutralisation  titres  were 
increased following Omicron secondary infection or vaccination and this is compatible with 
recent murine fate mapping experiments which show that de novo B cell responses against 
Omicron could develop due to the degree of antigenic divergence between the variants and 
that these primary clones targeted novel epitopes within the Omicron domain. We thus 
provide  evidence  suggesting  that,  whilst  antigenic  seniority  is  evident,  this  may  not 
functionally impinge on future protective responses in children.  
Cellular immunity is an important mediator of protection against severe COVID-19 (36). We 
find that robust T cell responses develop following either Omicron or pre-Omicron infection. 
Furthermore, and in direct contrast to humoral immunity, the magnitude of these responses 
is comparable. This response was also stable after re-infection and similar to that seen 
following vaccination. As such, cellular immunity appears to be highly sensitive to SARS-CoV-
2 infection and may reach a relative plateau following a range of differential initial antigen 
exposures. Cellular responses against Omicron and ancestral virus were broadly comparable, 
reflecting the ability of cellular immune recognition to tolerate viral mutations that evade 
humoral  recognition  (37).  T  cell  responses  against  endemic  HCoV  are  also  robust  and

somewhat higher in younger people (38), further suggesting a differential age-dependent 
priming of immunity against coronaviruses.  
Limitations of the study include absence of samples from vaccinees prior to infection and lack 
of prospective viral screening to accurately define reinfection following national withdrawal 
of community and home testing for SARS-CoV-2 after March 2022. 
Our results provide important new insights into SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in children 
and suggest that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to represent a fifth endemic 
coronavirus infection immunologically. These findings have implications for the future course 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on children. Whilst initial Omicron exposure does 
not reliably generate protective immunity against reinfection this is enhanced following re-
exposure and is broadly comparable against Omicron subvariants. Robust cellular responses 
should support clinical protection against severe disease. Furthermore, the nature of the 
initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure dictates the subsequent profile of antibody response to antigen 
challenge  and  may  direct  the  lifelong  pattern  of  response  to  SARS-CoV-2  variants  and 
vaccines. Immune imprinting will act as an important individual determinant of humoral 
immunity, the long-term immunological and clinical importance of which is uncertain.

Methods 
Sample collection  
Samples were collected from two prospective studies within the paediatric population.  
The SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in primary schools (sKIDs) study of children aged 6-14 years was 
a cross sectional 5-10ml blood collection study initiated in June 2020 by the United Kingdom 
Health Security Agency (UK-HSA) after schools reopened following the easing of national 
lockdown  (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-paediatric-surveillance).  Further 
collections for this study were undertaken after 21 months (March/April 2022) and 24 months 
(June/July 2022).  
The Born in Bradford study is a prospective longitudinal collection of 5-10ml blood samples 
from children aged 11-14 years in Bradford, UK undertaken to study SARS-CoV-2 immune 
responses (17). Initial sampling was undertaken at November 2020 and 3 additional samples 
from donors were collected at 6 monthly intervals until November 2022.  
Omicron infection was determined through linkage with the national SARS-CoV-2 testing 
database  (SGSS)  held  by  UKHSA  and  the  NIMS  database,  which  records  all  COVID-19 
vaccinations in England, was used to obtain records of COVID-19 vaccination and vaccine 
manufacturer for each dose. These data were accessed in May 2022.  
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Researchers were blinded to 
the status of donors before ELISpot and serological assessment. 
Ethical review for the sKIDs study was provided by the PHE Research Ethics and Governance 
Group (PHE R&D REGG ref. no. NR0209). Ethical Review of The Born in Bradford study was 
provided by the National Health Service Health Research Authority Yorkshire and the Humber 
(Bradford Leeds) Research Ethics Committee; REC reference: 16/YH/0320. Children and 
parents  or  guardians  were  provided  with  age-appropriate  information  sheets  prior  to

enrolment. Written informed consent was obtained from all from parents or guardians of all 
participants.  
PBMC and Plasma Preparation 
Lithium Heparin blood tubes were processed within 24hrs of collection. Briefly tubes were 
spun at 300g for 10mins prior to removal of plasma which was then spun at 800g for 10mins 
and stored as aliquots at -80°C. Remaining blood was diluted with RPMI and PBMC isolated 
on a Sepmate ficol density gradient (Stemcell), cells were washed with RPMI and rested in 
RPMI+10% batch tested FBS for a minimum of 4 hours prior to cellular assays. 
Serological analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response 
Quantitative  IgG  antibody  titres  were  measured  using  Mesoscale  Diagnostics  multiplex 
assays;  Coronavirus  Panel  22,  24,  25  and  27  as  previously  describe  (15)  following  the 
manufacturer instructions. Briefly, samples were diluted 1:5000 and added wells of the 96 
well plate alongside reference standards and controls. After incubation, plates were washed 
and  anti-IgG-Sulfo  tagged  detection  antibody  added.  Plates  were  washed  and  were 
immediately read using a MESO TM QuickPlex SQ 120 system. Data was generated by 
Methodological Mind software and analysed with MSD Discovery Workbench (v4.0) software. 
Data are presented as arbitrary units (AU)/ml determined relative to a 8-point standard curve 
generated on each MSD plate with standards provided by MSD. Cut-offs were previously 
defined against pre-pandemic adult and paediatric samples (15). Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-specific 
antibody titres above or below the geometric mean titre was used to define primary or 
secondary Omicron infection respectively. 
Pseudotype-based neutralisation assays 
Constructs and 293-ACE2 cells were previously described (15, 39). The assay was performed 
as previously described (15, 39), briefly neutralising activity in each sample was measured

against pseudo-virus displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike, either B.1 sequence or B.1.1.529:BA.1, 
BA.2, BA.4, BA.2.12.1, or BA.2.75 sequence, by a serial dilution approach. Each sample was 
serially diluted in triplicate from 1:50 to 1:36450 in complete DMEM prior to incubation with 
approximately 1x106 CPS (counts per second) per well of HIV (SARS-CoV-2) pseudotypes, 
incubated for 1 hour, and plated onto 239-ACE2 target cells.  After 48-72 hours, luciferase 
activity was quantified by the addition of Steadylite Plus chemiluminescence substrate and 
analysis on a Perkin Elmer EnSight multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK). 
Antibody titre was then estimated by interpolating the point at which infectivity had been 
reduced to 50% of the value for the no serum control samples. 
IFN-γ ELISpot 
T cell responses were measured using a IFN-γ ELISpot Pro kit (Mabtech) as previously 
described. (15) Pepmixes pool containing 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10aa from either 
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 or S2 domains from the Wuhan-Hu-1 (protein ID: P0DTC2) or Omicron 
(B1.1.529; BA.1) variant were purchased from JPT technologies. Overlapping pepmixes from 
influenza  A  matrix  protein  1,  California/08/2009  (H1N1)  (protein  ID:  C3W5Z8)  and 
A/Aichi/2/1968 H3N2 (protein ID: Q67157) were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies 
and combined as a relevant control. 
Briefly, fresh PBMC were rested overnight prior to assay and 0.25-0.3x106 PBMC were added 
in duplicate per well containing either pep-mix, or DMSO (negative) control, or a single well 
containing anti-CD3 (positive). Samples were incubated for 16-18hrs. Plates were developed 
following the manufacturer’s instructions and read using an AID plate reader (AID).

Extended Data Figure 2. Profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response following primary 
or secondary Omicron infection 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses were determined in longitudinal plasma samples 
from children with BA.1/2 infection. Spike (A) and RBD-specific (B) antibody binding against 
viral variants in samples from children (n=4) who were seronegative prior to  Omicron 
infection (yellow) and following BA.1/2 infection (green).   
Spike (C) and RBD-specific (D) antibody binding against viral variants in samples from children 
(n=11) who were seropositive prior to BA.1/2 infection (yellow) and following BA.1/2 infection 
(orange).   
Dotted lines indicate sero-positive cut-offs as determined for Wuhan-Hu-1-specific antibody 
response; dashed lines indicate below limit of detection. Friedman Test with Dunn’s multiple 
comparisons test.

Extended Data Figure 3. Antibody titre in respect of time from infection or vaccination. 
The prospective nature of sample collection was such that children were studied at varying 
timepoints after infection or vaccination. Antibody titre against ancestral B.1 spike was 
therefore plotted against time since antigen challenge to assess the potential impact of 
antibody waning.   
A)  Time from primary (green) or secondary (orange) Omicron infection.  
B)  Time from a first (triangle) or second (circle) COVID-19 vaccine dose. 
C)  Time from single vaccine dose in children with prior Omicron infection.  
D)  Time from Breakthrough infection or (E) last vaccine dose in vaccinated children who 
experienced a breakthrough Omicron infection.

Extended Data Figure 4. Relative antibody titre against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants following 
primary or secondary Omicron infection.  
Samples from children (n=43, aged 6-14 years) recently infected with Omicron BA.1/2 variant 
were assessed on the MSD-platform for antibodies against Spike protein (A) and RBD-domain 
(B) from SARS-CoV-2 variants as indicated. Donors were divided in those with primary SARS-
CoV-2 infection (green, n=20) or secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection (Orange, n=23). Values are 
also compared to antibody levels from historical children’s samples taken after SARS-CoV-2 
infection prior to emergence of Omicron (yellow, n=54, aged 5-14 years). Friedman Test with 
Dunn’s multiple comparisons test.

Extended Data Figure 5. Marked reduction in Omicron-specific antibody binding in sera 
from children with pre-Omicron natural infection 
Antibody binding to Wuhan-Hu-1 or BA.1 spike (A) or RBD-domain (B) in seropositive children 
(n=54, aged 5-14 years) and adults (n=30; aged >18 years), infected and sampled prior to the 
emergence of Omicron. Lines join individual donors. Inset percentage indicates the average 
reduction in binding (AU/ml) to Omicron protein compared to Wuhan. Kruskal-Wallis test 
with  Dunn’s  multiple  comparisons  test.  Dotted  lines  indicate  seropositive  cut-offs  as 
determined for Wuhan-specific response.
