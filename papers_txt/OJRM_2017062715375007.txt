1. Introduction 
Advanced osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is common and about 13% of women 
and 10% of men aged 60 years and older have symptomatic knee OA. Population 
affected with symptomatic Knee OA is increasing because of aging of the popu-
lation and increasing of obesity or overweight in general population [1]. 
Chronic knee pain from advanced osteoarthritis is often associated with tears 
in the fibro-cartilaginous meniscus and cruciate ligaments. The result is substan-
tial pain, impairments and loss of daily function, thus limiting activity and qual-
ity of life, often include loss of range of motion, inability to elevate the leg, pain 
increased with activity and gradual worsening over time. 
Current therapies, both surgical (arthroplasty) and not surgical (physical 
therapy, injection of hyaluronic acid, steroids injection), are focused on the relief 
of the symptoms but cannot repair the damage nor stop the degenerative process 
at the adjacent levels [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. 
In the past few years regenerative medicine focused on new strategies to slow 
down the degeneration process in joints and obtain tissues regeneration [7] [8]. 
In vitro and in vivo experimental studies have demonstrated that human me-
senchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate in vitro into many cell lineages, such 
as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes [9]. 
In the past 15 years, it has been shown that human MSCs also can promote 
vasculogenesis, which is the main mechanism involved in tissue repair. In addi-
tion, MSCs secrete a variety of bioactive molecules that act in a paracrine fashion 
to prime and sustain angiogenic, antifibrotic, antiapoptotic, and immunomodu-
latory responses in target tissue [9] [10]. 
The concept that fat tissue is an optimal source for MSCs which is now estab-
lished, supported by their abundance and compared to other tissues [11] [12] 
[13]. Indeed, 1/100 cells in the adipose tissue are MSCs compared to 1/100,000 
cells in the bone marrow.  
Fat tissue is easily available in most patients; it can be harvested with a mini-
mally invasive approach, offering a highly viable MSC population with optimal 
differentiation potential which is maintained with aging [14]. 
In the last few years, in literature appeared some studies about the improve-
ment of the therapeutic effects provided by the traditional fat transfer and fat 
grafting techniques [15] [16].  
To increase the regenerative potential MSC enrichment techniques based on 
enzymatic [17] [18] or mechanical [19] [20] devices have been proposed. 
The less manipulated fat tissue seems to work clinically better than enzymati-
18

cally isolated stem cells (both as svf or cultivated). In less manipulated fat tissue 
are preserved both cells and the niche: a natural adipose scaffold which is the 
“perfect functional unit” [11]. 
Mechanically derived MSC versus enzymatically isolated MSC have shown to 
have better differentiation potential, much larger secretome content, and a large 
difference in exosomes contents [14] [21] [22]. 
For this reason, a new device, named Lipogems®, has been developed [12] [13] 
[14]. The technique is non-traumatic and intra-operatively provides micro- 
fragmented adipose tissue in a short time (15 - 20 minutes). The fat tissue is 
treated mechanically without expansion and/or enzymatic treatment. Lipogems® 
device  provides  autologous,  micro-fragmented,  and  minimally  manipulated 
adipose tissue graft [11] [21]. 
Intraarticular ultrasound guided injection of autologous micro fragmented fat 
tissue provide excellent results in terms of pain, function, improvement of qual-
ity of life and may potentially stop the degenerative process by repair and re 
generation of injured or damaged soft tissues. 
In this case report we present a case of chronic worsening knee pain that 
failed prior standards of care including arthroscopic surgery, from advanced os-
teoarthritis and meniscal tears treated with the autologous adipose tissue using 
the Lipogems technology with a follow up of 2.5 years. 
2. Case Presentation 
The subject is a 73 YO male. The patient has advanced tricompartmental os-
teoarthritis and failed prior treatment including cortisone injection, non-ablative 
cryotherapy to the genicular nerves, hyaluronic acid injections, platelet rich 
plasma injection and arthroscopic meniscectomy of the medial and lateral me-
niscus. Patient was scheduled for joint replacement as it was his only option but 
he refused surgery. 
His right knee pain was constant, significantly affecting quality of life. Exam-
ples include that he could barely bend the knee, walking “straight-legged” and 
could not do simple activity such as putting on socks because he couldn’t bend 
the knee far enough. He had to wear slip on shoes and couldn’t put on pants 
without the help of his wife because of restricted range of motion. He went up 
steps one step at a time. He used to ride a bike and could no longer do that. His 
quality of life was extremely impaired with knee OA. 
The preoperative MRI revealed degenerative tear of the ACL, degenerative 
PCL, medial meniscus anterior and posterior horn portions not visualized, por-
tion of the anterior horn lateral meniscus not visualized, bone marrow edema 
and sub centimeter cyst medial femoral condyle. In addition there is advanced 
bone-on-bone medial and lateral joint osteoarthritis and chondromalacia patella. 
3. Materials and Methods 
The procedure was performed under local anesthesia. The donor site was the 
abdomen on each side below and laterals to the umbilicus. Before harvesting the 
19 

NEW PAGE

R. Striano et al. 
 
fat tissue, the entry point for harvest was injected with local anesthesia. Two 
small incisions were performed with the bevel of an 18 G needle, and 250 cc of 
anesthetic tumescent fluid was injected using a 17 G blunt cannula channeling 
on a spokes on a wheel fashion. The fat (60 cc) was then harvested using a 13 G 
blunt cannula attached to a Vaclok 30 ml syringe and introduced into the Lipo-
gems® processing kit. 
A complete diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound examination was perfor- 
med to gain real-time information and map/visualize each point of interest for 
deployment of the treatment. 1 cc aliquots of fat graft were injected under con-
tinuous ultrasound guidance. 3 cc’s were injected into the medial compartment 
in an infrapatellar approach. 3 cc’s were injected into the lateral compartment in 
an infrapatellar approach. 1 cc was injected into each the medial and lateral me-
niscus. 2 cc’s were injected into anterior cruciate ligament. 
Ultrasound guidance was administered using a GE logiqP6 ultrasound unit 
with a ML5-15 MHz matrix linear probe. 
No peri-procedural complications or adverse events were observed. 
4. Outcome Measures 
Pre and post treatment clinical outcomes were determined using the NPS pain 
scale with no separate walking function scores, recording functional impairment 
with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), measuring the 
range of motion by instrumentation and assessing quadricep strength measured 
digitally. Follow up is at designated time points to 2 ½ years after the procedure. 
5. Ethics 
The procedure mentioned in this case report is in accordance with the ethical 
standards and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The pa-
tient has been informed about risks, benefits and alternative options to the pro-
posed treatment and expressed and signed the informed consent form. 
6. Results 
In the immediate post injection period, there was a significant decrease in pain, 
as noticed in previous studies and other patients treated with this technique.  
KOOS function score was 25/100 with 100 being perfect score. Range of mo-
tion was 0 - 50 degrees with fully extension and flexion impairment, with 135 
degrees being normal. Strength measured digitally in lbs./in2 was 7.  
After a 2 ½ years follow up NPS pain is 1/10. KOOS function is 71/100. Range 
of motion is 0 - 105 degrees. Quadriceps strength is 27 lbs/in2. First post treat-
ment clinical evaluation was taken at month 6 (Figures 1-8). 
7. Discussion 
Considering the increasing of general population age and obesity and the result-
ing increasing of joints OA is mandatory to provide curative option for

patients. 
In most cases where patients have failed the current standards of non-surgical 
care, the only option is joint replacement, particular for elderly patients [1]. 
In this panorama regenerative medicine may give a new option for those who 
are not candidates for surgery, do not want surgery of are unable to have surgery 
due to concomitant medical conditions. Here the biological deployment of fat 
graft may potentially prove a viable option to reduce pain, restore function, im-
prove quality of life and show promise in halting the degenerative. 
Lipogems® system has been developed to improve the classical fat graft lipofil-
ling technique [15] with the aim of providing transplantable clusters of lipoaspi-
rate with reduced size to improve engraftment. The system is a disposable kit for 
the aspiration, processing and reinjection of autologous adipose tissue in both 
human and veterinary medicine [18] [23]. Its core is a disposable and closed de-
vice filled with saline solution that progressively reduces the size of the clusters

of adipose tissue by means of mild mechanical forces and eliminates oil and 
blood residues responsible for the inflammation processes. The technique is 
non-traumatic and intra-operatively provides micro-fragmented fat in a short 
time (15 - 20 minutes), without expansion and/or enzymatic treatment. The 
vasculo stromal niches of Lipogems® survive in the site of the injection and im-
prove tissue health benefits [23]. Micro-fragmented clusters contain small-sized, 
intact adipocytes that may play an important role in cell paracrine action. 
The positive clinical outcome, in a joint that would have been considered resi-
lient to improvement, with the potential repair and regeneration of the cartilage 
is very promising. Adipose tissue has been positively highlighted in different 
studies detailing a cascade of events including signaling, trophic, immunomo-
dulatory, mitogenic, anti-microbial, anti-scarring, and anti-apoptotic properties 
that contribute to potential regenerative mechanisms. 
While more studies are required to validate the effectiveness of this approach 
for the treatment of knee pain, this data is very encouraging. 
Theories as to mechanism of action may include the micro-fragmented adi-
pose tissue providing volume, support, cushioning, filling of soft tissue defects or 
potential healing and regenerative capabilities. Additional mechanisms may in-
clude direct differentiation and chondrogenesis, regenerative signaling by acti-
vated perivascular cells tissue repair, signaling of trophic and paracrine media-
tors [19], activation of opioid receptors [24], pain reduction, down-regulation of 
destructive cytokines in the microenvironment, reduction of the arthrogenic 
muscle inhibition [25], exosome initiated cascades or a combination of all of 
these. 
The improvement in measured outcomes for pain, KOOS, MRI imaging, qua-
driceps strength and range of motion showing sustained gains up to 2.5 years 
support these theories.  
The results in this case report supported with other case studies about the re-
generative potential of micro-fragmented adipose tissue in the treatment of knee 
pain and joint de generation are encouraging. 
Fat tissue transfer with Lipogems harvesting device appears to provide a viable 
option for the painful knee after the initial diagnosis including advanced os-
teoarthritis in those patients who fail conventional treatments, and do not want 
or are not candidates for surgery. 
8. Conclusion 
While this is a Level 5 single case study, on a subject with severe joint pathology 
and instability, the injections of autologous, micro-fragmented, and minimally 
manipulated adipose tissue resulted in significant improvement in pain, function 
and quality of life. No adverse events were reported. Several studies are ongoing 
needed to confirm this result.
