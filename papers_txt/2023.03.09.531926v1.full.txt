ABSTRACT 
  The Hippo pathway controls tissue growth and regulates stem cell fate through the 
activities of core kinase cassette that begins with the Sterile 20-like kinase MST1/2. Activation of 
MST1/2 relies on trans-autophosphorylation but the details of the mechanisms regulating that 
reaction are not fully elucidated. Proposals include dimerization as a first step and include multiple 
models for potential kinase-domain dimers. Efforts to verify and link these dimers to trans-
autophosphorylation were unsuccessful. We explored the link between dimerization and trans-
autophosphorylation for MST2 and the entire family of MST kinases. We analyzed crystal lattice 
contacts of structures of MST kinases and identified an ensemble of kinase-domain dimers 
compatible with trans-autophosphorylation. These dimers share a common dimerization interface 
comprised of the activation loop and  aG-helix while the arrangements of the kinase-domains 
within the dimer varied depending on their activation state. We then verified the dimerization 
interface and determined its function using MST2. Variants bearing alanine substitutions of the 
aG-helix prevented dimerization of the MST2 kinase domain both in solution and in cells. These 
substitutions also blocked autophosphorylation of full-length MST2 and its Drosophila homolog 
Hippo in cells. These variants retain the same secondary structure as wild-type and capacity to 
phosphorylate a protein substrate, indicating the loss of MST2 activation can be directly attributed 
to a loss of dimerization rather than loss of either fold or catalytic function. Together this data 
functionally links dimerization and autophosphorylation for MST2 and suggests this activation 
mechanism is conserved across both species and the entire MST family.

INTRODUCTION 
The Hippo pathway controls decisions of cell number and cell fate by regulating the activity 
the transcriptional co-factors YAP/TAZ through a core kinase cassette that includes two kinases 
MST1/2 and LATS1/2 (1–4). The Hippo pathway is controlled by multiple signals ranging from 
mechanotransduction  to  G-protein  coupled  receptors  to  cell-cell  contacts.  A  long-standing 
question was how a diverse set of signals converge on and regulate the activity of the kinase 
cassette. Activation of the first kinase in the cassette, MST1/2, requires phosphorylation of its 
activation loop and is largely the result of trans-autophosphorylation (5–7). We found cellular 
events that stimulate MST1/2 activation trigger autophosphorylation by increasing the effective 
concentration of MST1/2 (8). We then wondered if proximity was sufficient for MST1/2 activation 
or if additional events were required. Multiple reports suggested a link between kinase-domain 
dimerization and autophosphorylation for both MST1/2 and its Drosophila homolog Hippo (9–11). 
In fact, MST2 kinase-domains dimerize in solution, but the weak affinity (K  = 36µM) made the 
d
physiological  relevance  difficult  to  rationalize.  Considering  activating  events  increased  the 
effective concentration of MST1/2 in cells that could, in turn, promote kinase-domain dimerization, 
we revisited the possible connection between dimerization and autophosphorylation for MST1/2.  
  Two different dimers have been proposed for MST1/2 and Hippo, but attempts to identify 
residues required for both functions proved unfruitful and called into question the biological 
significance of the proposed dimers (9,11). We wondered whether related kinases could inform 
on the mechanisms of MST1/2 activation. MST1/2 is part of the Sterile 20-like (MST) kinase family 
that, despite varying biological roles, are each activated by trans-autophosphorylation (6,12,13). 
This family likely shares a conserved activation mechanism owing to the high level of sequence 
conservation of the kinase-domains (46-88% identity). The family can be further subdivided based 
on the presence of additional domains (14–16). All start with a kinase domain but the GCK-II sub-
family, comprised of MST1 (STK4) and MST2 (STK3), is followed by a linker and a C-terminal 
SARAH domain while the GCK-III sub-family, comprised of MST3 (STK24), MST4(STK26), and 
STK25 (SOK1/YSK1), is followed by an alternate C-terminal dimerization domain and bind MO25 
proteins(16–18).  Studies  on  the  activation  of  the  related  kinase  MST4,  which  undergoes 
autophosphorylation when bound to the activating protein MO25, found the kinase-domain to also 
weakly associate in solution with a K  in the tens of micromolar and also arrived at two different 
d 
models for dimerization, and attributed the differences in models to representing different steps 
of autophosphorylation (13,19).  
We set out to understand whether or how dimerization contributes to autophosphorylation 
MST2 and the entire MST family. We started by analyzing crystal lattice contacts of MST kinase-
domains to identify potential dimers compatible with trans-autophosphorylation. Our analysis 
identified eight potential dimers, each of which was mediated by the activation loop and the aG-
helix on the C-lobe. These dimers clustered into three groups based on both the relative 
arrangement of the kinase-domains within the dimers and the activation state of the kinase or 
presence of binding partners. We then validated these structural observations with functional 
studies of the aG-helix using MST2. Variants with alanine substitutions of the aG-helix did not 
dimerize either in vitro or in cells, establishing the aG-helix is required for dimerization. The same 
substitutions impaired autophosphorylation of both full-length protein in cells and of kinase-
domains in a purified system. Equivalent substitutions in Hippo also impaired activation in cells. 
The lack of autophosphorylation, which requires dimerization of the kinase-domains, can be 
attributed  to  substitution  of  these  residues,  that  neither  disrupted  folding  nor  substrate 
phosphorylation. Together our data links dimerization to autophosphorylation of MST2 through 
the aG-helix and suggests this activation mechanism is conserved across the MST family and 
across species.

RESULTS 
 
A conserved region mediates dimerization of MST kinase-domains 
Given the sequence conservation between the kinase-domains of the MST family, we and 
others reasoned these kinases likely share a conserved mechanism of activation(13) (Figure 1). 
We set out to understand the nature of kinase-domain dimerization for the MST family and 
perhaps identify conserved features that may guide activation of the family and thus provide 
insight into the specifics of MST2 activation. To understand how these kinase-domains dimerize 
and possibly resolve differences between proposed models, we identified all unique observations 
of kinase-domain pairs generated by crystal symmetry of previously determined structures of the 
MST family (MST1-4 and STK25) (11,13,19–28). This analysis identified 73 unique kinase-
domain pairs (Table 1).  
We first asked if the same kinase-domain dimer mediated lattice contacts in multiple 
crystal forms since biologically relevant interfaces are more likely to mediate crystal contacts than 
non-physiological ones (29,30). A well-known example of the same biological interface mediating 
contacts in different lattices is the asymmetric kinase-domain dimer of Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor (EGFR) (31). We compared the structure of each kinase-domain pair to every other pair 
by iterative superpositions and found no conserved arrangement among all the pairs or any 
subgroup (Table S1, S2). We then asked if any kinase-domain pairs were compatible with trans-
autophosphorylation. Rather than identifying dimers correlated with a specific step in trans-
autophosphorylation, we used two criteria that could describe any step in the reaction. First, 
potential dimers must bury sufficient surface area to be considered a biologically relevant 
interface. In crystal lattices, biological assemblies are larger than non-physiological ones and 
typically bury at least 500Å2 of surface area (29,30). We calculated the surface area buried in 
each kinase-domain pair (Table S3) and found nearly half satisfied this requirement. Second, 
within a potential dimer the kinase-domains should be poised for trans-autophosphorylation, 
specifically the activation loop of one kinase must be able to extend into the catalytic cleft of its 
partner. We calculated whether each activation loop could theoretically extend into the catalytic 
cleft of its partner and found eleven were properly poised pairs (Table S3). From our initial set, 
eight  pairs  satisfied  both  requirements  (1_3COM_MST1,  6_MST1_6YAT,  11_4LG4_MST2, 
12_4LG4_MST2, 30_5DH3_MST2, 34_5DH3_MST2, 59_3GGF_MST4, and 69_4FZA_MST4) 
(Table  2,  Figure  2,  S1).  These  dimers  represented  the  spectrum  of  structures  analyzed, 
containing representative from three out of the five MST family members and both phosphorylated 
and unphosphorylated kinases. This set included the four previously proposed dimers as well as 
four novel dimers (9,11,13,19).  
The dimer interface of each of these dimers was mediated by the same regions, the 
activation loop and aG-helix (Figure 2, S1). The relative orientation of the kinases within these 
dimer, however, varied clustered into three groups based on the relative position of the kinase-
domains as well as the phosphorylation state of the kinase-domain or presence of activating 
proteins (Figure 2, S1). One group contains the four phosphorylated dimers (1_3COM_MST1, 
6_6YAT_MST1, 30_5DH3_MST2, and 31_5DH3_MST2), another the three unphosphorylated 
dimers (11_4LG4_MST2, 12_4LG4_MST2, and 59_3GGF_MST4), and the final a single dimer 
bound to the activator protein MO25 (69_4FZA_MST4). Dimers of MST2 and MST4 appear in 
both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated clusters, perhaps revealing the range of structural 
space these kinase sample during trans-autophosphorylation (Figure S1).  
We analyzed the interface of the highest resolution member of each group to understand 
the  specific  interactions  mediating  dimerization  of  each  group  (Figure  2).  For  the 
unphosphorylated kinase domain dimer, the aG-helices form a single docking site that engages 
both activation loops (Figure 2A). In this arrangement, the site of phosphorylation (T180, MST2

numbering) is facing away from the interface suggesting it may represent a pre-catalytic state. 
The phosphorylated kinase-domain dimer, which is the only asymmetric dimer, has two interfaces 
that each engage several structural hallmarks of the active kinase-domain conformation (Figure 
2B). In one interface, the aG-helix of one kinase binds the activation loop (pT183, MST1 
numbering), HRD motif (R149, D150), and  aC-helix (E69) of its partner through a series of non-
bonded contacts and an extended hydrogen bonding network. In the other interface, the other 
aG-helix engages the aC-helix of its partner kinase forming a surface on which the activation loop 
of its partner kinase docks. In both interfaces E69 of the aC-helix forms a salt bridge with R231 
of the aG-helix. For the MST4 kinase dimer bound to MO25, the dimerization is mediated by the 
aG-helices as well as the activation and P+1 loops and a two equivalent inter-kinase salt bridges 
using K233 (MST4 numbering) and D171. The activator protein does not make any contribution 
to the dimer interface (Figure 2C).  
 
The aG-helix mediates kinase domain dimerization 
We wanted to validate the interfaces in observed in the structures and determine the 
function of the aG-helix in dimerization and activation of MST2. To avoid disrupting the fold of the 
kinase-domain, we made two variants in which we substituted a set of surface residues that 
comprised either the N-terminal (MST2-KGN) or C-terminal (MST2-KGC) region of the aG-helix with 
alanine. We did not make any substitutions in the activation loop as they would likely impair the 
function of the kinase-domain. The variants were expressed and purified similar to wild-type. To 
ensure the variants had the same fold as wild-type we compared the secondary structures of 
MST2-KWT,  MST2-KGN, and MST2-KGC  using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) (Figure 3). Each of 
the three far-UV CD spectra have a well-defined minima at 208nm and a shallower minima at 
222nm indicating a mix of a-helical and b-sheet that is consistent with the known secondary 
structure composition of the kinase-domain. Within error, the spectra of the alanine variants 
overlay with wild-type indicating that the substitutions did not disrupt the kinase-domain fold.  
Then we directly monitored dimerization of the MST2 kinase-domains using sedimentation 
analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and compared the solution behavior of wild-type (MST2-KWT) 
to both aG-helix variants, (MST2-KGN and MST2-KGC). We computed the apparent sedimentation 
coefficient distributions, g(s*), for all proteins over a range of concentrations. For MST2-KWT, upon 
increasing concentration we observed a shift from lower to higher apparent Svedberg coefficient 
indicative of monomer-dimer equilibrium. For MST-KGN and MST-KGC, no shift was observed over 
the protein concentration analyzed (Figure 4A) suggesting these variants, which have a disrupted 
aG-helix, were monomeric. 
We then asked if these substitutions disrupted MST2 kinase-domain dimerization in cells. 
We first attempted to detect oligomerization between MST2 kinase-domains using standard 
immunoprecipitation assays. While we could detect a complex between differentially tagged full-
length MST2, which form a high affinity complex owing to dimerization of the C-terminal SARAH-
domains (32,33), no interactions were detected between differentially tagged kinase-domains 
(Figure S2) which is consistent with the reported weak disassociation constant.  
Avidity-based  approach  are  able  to  detect  weaker  interactions  that  straight 
immunoprecipitations owing to the use of oligomeric tags, so we employed that strategy to detect 
interactions between MST2 kinase-domains (34). For the bait, we used a MST2-K fused to the 
dimeric Fc protein with a V5 tag for detection. For the prey, MST2-K was fused to the pentameric 
cartilage outer matrix protein (COMP) and a FLAG tagged added for detection and alkaline 
phosphatase (AP) for a mass tag to help distinguish the different variants on Western blots. With 
this approach we successfully detected binding of avidity-tagged wild-type MST2-K (Figure 4B, 
S3). No interactions, however, were detected for either variants bearing substitutions of the aG-

helix (MST2-KGN and MST2-KGC) (Figure 4B) demonstrating that disruption of a single aG-helix 
is sufficient to prevent oligomerization. Together these data suggest the aG-helix mediates 
dimerization of MST2 kinase-domains.  
 
Dimerization is required for autophosphorylation  
We  wondered  if  the  residues  required  for  dimerization  were  also  required  for 
autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the activation loop of MST2 was monitored by Western 
blot in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type MST2-FL 
(MST2-FLWT), MST2-FL variants bearing substitutions of aG-helix (MST2-FLGN or MST2-FLGC), or 
the  kinase-inactivating  substitution  (MST2-FLD146N)  (Figure  5A).  No  activation  loop 
phosphorylation was detected for either MST2-FLGN, MST2-FLGC, or MST2-FLD146N but was 
detected for MST2-FLWT. Disruption of the aG-helix impairs autophosphorylation of MST2.  
To ensure the lack of autophosphorylation for MST2-FLGN and MST2-FLGC could be 
directly attributed to changes in the kinase-domain rather than interactions with other domains or 
proteins found in a cell, we analyzed autophosphorylation of MST2-KWT, MST2-KGN and MST2-
KGC in vitro. We expressed and purified three unphosphorylated variants corresponding to wild-
type (MST2-KWT) and variants with a substituted aG-helix (MST2-KGN or MST2-KGC), incubated 
each with ATP and Mg+2, and monitored phosphorylation by Western blot (Figure 5B). MST2-KWT 
autophosphorylated,  but  MST2-KGN  or  MST2-KGC  did  not  suggesting  the  loss  of 
autophosphorylation is a direct consequence of disruption of the aG-helix. 
 
MST2 variants are catalytically active 
We also wanted to determine if the kinase-domain variants retained catalytic function so 
the observed lack of autophosphorylation could be attributed to disruption of dimerization rather 
than a simple loss of catalytic activity. We monitored the ability of wild-type and variant kinase-
domains to phosphorylate a substrate. We made activated MST2-K variants by incubating 
unphosphorylated MST2-KWT, MST2-KGN, MST2-KGC or a catalytically inactive variant, MST2-
KD146N, with ATP and phosphorylated MST2-FL, after which MST2-FL was removed by affinity 
purification.  The  phosphorylated  MST2-K  variants  were  incubated  with  a  known  substrate, 
MOB1A, and phosphorylation of MOB1A monitored by Western blot (Figure 6). MST2-KD146N 
serves as a negative control to determine if any active MST2-FL carried through to the substrate 
phosphorylation assay. Minimal phosphorylation of MOB1A was observed for MST2-KD146N , thus 
ensuring any phosphorylation of MOB1A can be attributed to the MST2 variant tested. MST2-KWT, 
MST2-KGN, and MST2-KGC each phosphorylated MOB1A demonstrating that substitution of the 
aG-helix did not destroy catalytic function. We note the different levels of MOB1A phosphorylation 
likely reflect the varying levels of active MST2 in each reaction, as judged by the fraction of MST2 
phosphorylated  on  pT180  (Figure  6),  which  would  have  different  rates  of  substrate 
phosphorylation.  
 
Equivalent residues mediate autophosphorylation of Hippo  
  We analyzed the conservation of the aG-helix in Hippo and found it was absolutely 
conserved  barring  one  residue  (T235  in  MST2  is  Q250  in  Hippo)  (Figure  1).  Given  this 
conservation, we wondered if autophosphorylation of Hippo relied on equivalent residues as 
MST2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type Hippo 
(Hippo-FLWT),  catalytically  inactive  Hippo  (Hippo-FLK51R),  or  variants  bearing  substitutions 
equivalent to either the N-terminal or C-terminal half of the  aG-helix surface (Hippo-FLGN, Hippo-
FLGC), and autophosphorylation monitored by Western blot (Figure 7). We observed robust 
phosphorylation  for  Hippo-FLWT  but  not  Hippo-FLK51R  demonstrating  the  phosphorylation

observed  is  from  autophosphorylation.  Substitution  of  the aG-helix  in  Hippo  prevented 
autophosphorylation suggesting this function of this helix is conserved across species.  
 
DISCUSSION 
We set out to understand the role of kinase-domain dimerization in activation via trans-
autophosphorylation for the MST family and potentially resolve the differences between the dimer 
proposed dimerization models. Our data provides clear evidence that a conserved set of residues 
mediate dimerization associated with trans-autophosphorylation for the entire MST family and, by 
using MST2 as a model system, validate the structural models of dimerization and provide a 
functional link between dimerization and autophosphorylation. Our work rationalizes previous 
results and further suggests this mode of dimerization may be evolutionarily conserved for MST 
kinases.   
Establishing a role for the aG-helix in both dimerization and autophosphorylation of MST2 
furthers our understanding molecular mechanism of MST2 activation. Earlier work suggested 
activating events that increased the proximity of MST2 triggered autophosphorylation (8). This 
model can now be modified to increased proximity promotes autophosphorylation by promoting 
dimerization that is required for autophosphorylation. This model predicts regulatory proteins that 
bind to the residues required for dimerization would block activation of MST kinases. Our data 
also  demonstrate  that  requirements  for  autophosphorylation  are  different  than  substrate 
phosphorylation  as  MST2  variants  unable  to  undergo  autophosphorylation  could  still 
phosphorylate a protein substrate (Figure 5,6).  
Our structural analysis revealed the MST family shares a conserved mode of dimerization 
(Figure 2, Figure S1). The interface of each potential trans-autophosphorylation dimer was 
mediated by the aG-helix, a highly conserved region between human GCKII and GCKIII families 
(Figure 1) (50% identity). We validated the role of aG-helix when we found substitution of these 
residues disrupted both dimerization and autophosphorylation of MST2 (Figures 4,5); the role of 
these residues in activation had been previously validated for MST4 (19). We also find that these 
same  residues  are  required  for  autophosphorylation  of  Hippo,  suggesting  this  activation 
mechanism is conserved across species (Figure 7). The identity of this region is not maintained 
in other GCK kinase families (0% identity) suggesting dimerization modes vary between kinase 
families.  
We  did  not  anticipate  that  multiple  dimers  would  be  compatible  with  trans-
autophosphorylation. While initially perplexed by the lack of a common dimer, several lines of 
reasoning supported activation being compatible with multiple conformations. A fundamental 
difference between MST and ErbB kinases is the nature of kinase domain activation. ErbBs do 
not require autophosphorylation for activation so the kinase dimer must be maintained for activity 
(31). In contrast, activity of MST family requires activation loop phosphorylation, but once 
phosphorylated the trans-autophosphorylation dimer is no longer required and must dissemble to 
accommodate  substrate  binding.  This  trans-autophosphorylation  dimer  represents  an 
enzyme:substrate complex that by nature is a less stable, has a shorter half-life than typical 
protein:protein interactions, and must disassociate to allow phosphorylation of other substrates 
by the now activated kinase. Further, the weak affinity of the kinase-domain dimer of the MST2 
kinase domain equates to a significantly lower energetic requirement for complex assembly than 
would be required by stronger affinity complexes. This lower energetic barrier could be satisfied 
by multiple conformations.  
We identified 8 ensemble dimers that clustered into three groups based the relative 
arrangement of the kinase-domains within the dimers and aligned with the presence or absence 
of activation loop phosphorylation or activator proteins (Figure 2, S1). It is, indeed, tempting to

speculate these groups represent pre- and post-catalytic states; all the kinases-domains in the 
phosphorylated group adopt the active conformation and the dimer interface engages multiple 
regulatory elements (aC-helix, HRD motif, and the activating site of phosphorylation on the 
activation  loop)  that  stabilize  that  active  conformation.  In  contrast,  the  kinases  in  the 
unphosphorylated group adopt a variety of partially active conformations. The structural variation 
within this ensemble may represent the structural space sampled by a kinase during trans-
autophosphorylation. In the future, experiments looking at the structural dynamics of trans-
autophosphorylation  should  investigate  the  repacking  of  the  dimer  interface  and  the 
rearrangements within the kinase that occur during trans-autophosphorylation. Our work suggests 
a conserved interface mediates dimerization and activation for the entire MST family and it will be 
interesting going forward investigating how molecular mechanisms of activation vary between 
kinase families. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
 
Generation of lattice dimers 
The Protein Data Bank(35) on 7/5/20 data contained 47 crystal structures of GCKII and 
GCKIII family members. This list was then pruned to contain only unique crystal forms. By this 
process we identified 15 unique crystals forms that included representatives from each of the five 
family members and both phosphorylated or unphosphorylated kinases (Table 1). If binding 
partners or other domains were present in the structures, those components were removed for 
generation of lattice-mediated kinase-domain pairs. We then manually identified all unique kinase-
domain pairs mediated by contacts either within the asymmetric unit or by crystal symmetry using 
UCSF Chimera(36) resulting in 73 independently observed kinase-domain pairs.   
 
Structural Analysis 
Both buried surface area calculations and identification of residues buried at the interface 
were performed in AREAIMOL in CCP4 (37). The criteria for the aG-helix to be mediating 
dimerization was burial of a single residue. To determine the similarity of kinase-domain dimers, 
the C-lobe of every kinase was superposed onto each kinase-domain in every other kinase-
domain dimer using LSQKAB in CCP4 (37). If the superposition generated an RMSD less than 
3Å over the 78 Ca-atoms, then dimers were considered similar. To determine if the kinases were 
properly positioned, we first modeled the position of ATP in the catalytic cleft of one kinase by 
superimposing the structure of MST3 bound to AMP-PNP onto each kinase in the pair (PDBID 
4QML)(26) and then measured the distance between the g phosphate and either the start (residue 
162, MST2 numbering) or end of the activation loop (residue 185) of the partner kinase. Kinases 
were deemed properly poised if, assuming the activation loop was fully extended, T180 could be 
positioned in the activation cleft of its partner. 
 
Avidity pull-downs 
  HEK293T cells were seeded at 0.4*106cells/well in 6-well plates, 24 hours later they were

800CW  Goat  anti-Mouse  (LI-COR,  Lot  C81106-01,  diluted  1:10,000)  secondary  antibody, 
respectively. Blots were scanned on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). For Western 
blots of the alanine-substitution variants the same protocol was followed except for the use of an 
anti-Rabbit HRP-linked secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Lot 28, diluted 1:10,000) for the V5 
antibody. Then blots were incubated with Clarity MaxTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and 
scanned with a GBox Chemi XX9 System (SYNGENE).  Band intensity were quantified by ImageJ 
(38). The amount of normalized, bound protein was calculated by first subtracting the amount of 
background binding for each variant and then expressing the amount of bound protein as a 
fraction relative to the amount of bound, wild-type MST2-FL or wild-type MST2-K fused to the 
COMP avidity tag.  
 
Protein expression and purification   
DNA encoding residues 1-314 of human MST2 kinase-domain (UniprotKB Q13188) were 
cloned downstream of a hexa-histidine and SUMO tags into either a modified pBAD4 plasmid(39) 
for MST2-Kwt and MST2-KD146N, or pRSF-Duet (EMD-Millipore, MA) for MST2-KGN and MST2-KGC. 
MST2-KGN had residues (Y221, F231, M232, T235, N236, P237, P238) substituted to alanine and 
MST2-KGC had these residues (K218, D223, I224, H225, P226, M227, R228) substituted with 
alanine. For expression, MST2 variants were transformed into T7 express cells (New England 
BioLabs, MA) along with a plasmid encoding maltose binding protein (MBP) l-Phosphatase. 
Bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C until OD600 of 2.0, and protein expression induced with 
0.25mM Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cultures were grown at 20°C overnight 
and then harvested.  
All MST2 variants were purified as follows. Cells were lysed in 50mM Tris, pH 8.0, 400mM 
NaCl, 5% glycerol supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma, MO). Clarified lysate 
was incubated with Nickel charged Profinity-IMAC resin (Biorad, CA) for one hour at 4°C, and 
protein eluted with 125mM imidazole. The hexa-histidine and SUMO tags were removed following 
incubation with SENP protease (made in house). Cleaved proteins were further purified by anion 
exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies. Final proteins were flash frozen at 10mg/mL in 
10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP).  
To generate phosphorylated MST2-K, following anion-exchange chromatography variants 
were incubated with phosphorylated H6-MST2-FL (made in  house(8)) and 5mM ATP, 10mM 
MgCl , 5mM NaF, 1mM Na VO  for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reactions were further 
2 3 4
purified  on  Ni-IMAC  resin  to  remove  H6-MST2-FL,  and  to  the  flow-through  20mM  of 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added to quench the reaction. Phosphorylation of 
the variants were confirmed by Western-blot, and phosphorylated MST2-K proteins were further 
purified by size-exclusion chromatography. 
The DNA encoding a truncated human MOB1A (residues 16-216, UniProtKB Q9H8S9) 
(MOB1AD15)  were  cloned  into  a  modified  pBAD4  plasmid(39)  downstream  from  N-terminal 
hexahistidine and SUMO tags. MOB1AD15 was co-expressed with MBP tagged l Phosphatase in 
pRSF-Duet. Plasmids were transformed into T7 express cells (New England Biolabs). Cells were 
grown to OD  of 1.0 at 37oC, induced with 0.5mM IPTG, and grown an additional 16 hours at 
600
20oC.  Unphosphorylated  MOB1AD15  was  purified  following  the  same  protocol  as  for 
unphosphorylated MST2-K.

CD Spectroscopy.   
Far-UV  CD  spectra  were  collected  on  an  Aviv  Model  410  spectrophotometer  (Aviv 
Biomedical, NJ). CD samples contained 11µM of each MST2-K variant in 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 
200mM NaCl, 5%glycerol, and 0.5mM TCEP (ThermoFisher). Spectra were recorded at 20oC 
using a 0.1 cm pathlength cuvette. Data were collected with a 1nm step size, averaging for 3 
seconds at each step. Before analysis, spectra from the buffer control were subtracted from each 
spectra; this blank subtracted data was converted to molar residue ellipticity (MRE). Data was 
plotted in Prism.  
 
Analytical Ultracentrifugation assays 
  All proteins were dialyzed overnight into 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 
and 1mM TCEP. The resulting dialysate was used as a reference. Proteins were diluted in 
dialysate to 8.5μM, 17.1μM, 25.7μM, 34.3μM. AUC cells were assembled using SedVel60K 1.2-
cm  meniscus-matching  centerpieces  (SpinAnalytical)  and  sapphire  windows.  Sample  and 
dialysate were loaded into the cells and spun at 25,000rpm in a Beckman XL-I until the menisci 
of sample and buffer matched. Concentrations were slightly diluted as a result of meniscus 
matching. The cells were then removed and inverted multiple times to remix the samples. The 
samples were allowed to return to equilibrium under vacuum at 20oC for 2hr. Sedimentation 
velocity experiments were run at 50,000rpm using interference optics collecting scans every 
30sec for each cell for a total of 980 scans. 
Sedimentation coefficient g(s*) distributions were generated from a subset of primary data 
where the sedimenting boundary curves had completely cleared the meniscus and located 
approximately  in  the  middle  of  the  centrifuge  cell  using  DCCT+  by  John  Philo  (version 
2.5.1)(40,41). Partial specific volumes were calculated from the protein sequence and buffer 
density from the individual components using SEDNTERP(42). Data was plotted in Prism.  
 
In vitro autophosphorylation assays 
10µM of unphosphorylated MST2-K was incubated in 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 
5mM MgCl , 0.5mM MnCl , 1mM NaF, 1mM Na VO , 4% glycerol, and 1mM TCEP in the 
2 2 3 4
presence or absence of 1mM ATP at room temperature for 60 minutes. Reactions were quenched 
with 20mM EDTA, and samples analyzed by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE and Western blot 
using a primary antibody that recognizes MST2 phosphorylated at T180 (Cell Signaling, Lot 1, 
1:1000 dilution) and the secondary antibody, IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit antibody (LI-COR, 
Lot C90220-06, 1:10,000 dilution). Reactions were performed three times. Band intensities were 
quantified, and the relative fraction of phosphorylated MST2 determined by dividing the intensity 
of the pT180 band by the intensity of the Coomassie band and then normalizing the signal 
between blots to a loading control included on each blot. 
 
Cell-based autophosphorylation assays  
HEK293T cells were seeded at 0.2*106cells/well in 6-well plates, transfected with indicated 
plasmids twenty-four hours later, and lysed twenty-four hours following in ice-cold RIPA buffer 
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (25mM Tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% 
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Sodium Deoxycholate) supplemented with 
1mM PMSF, 1mM Na VO , 10mM NaF, 2.5mM Na P O , 1mM β-glycerophosphate, 5mM EDTA.

and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. Clarified lysates were normalized by BCA Assay and normalized 
samples run on Western Blot. Blots were probed with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 that 
recognized either HA (Roche, Lot34502100), MYC (Santa Cruz, Lot L1318), or pT180 (Cell

Signaling, Lot 2) epitopes followed secondary antibodies diluted 1:10,000 by either IRDye800CW 
Goat anti-Rat (LI-COR, Lot D00225-01), IRDye800CW Goat anti-Mouse(LI-COR, Lot C81106-
01), or IRDye800CW goat anti-Rabbit (LI-COR, Lot C90220-06), respectively. The fraction of 
pT180 was determined by dividing the intensity of pT180 band by the intensity of the epitope tag 
and then dividing the result by the fraction of pT180 for wild-type of that replicate.  
 
In vitro substrate phosphorylation assays 
0.1µM of phosphorylated MST2-K was incubated with MOB1AD15  in the same buffer used 
for autophosphorylation reactions in the presence or absence of 1mM ATP at room temperature 
for  30  minutes.  Reactions  were  quenched  with  20mM  EDTA,  and  samples  analyzed  by 
Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a primary antibody that recognizes 
phosphorylated T35 of MOB1A (Cell Signaling, Lot 2, 1:1000 dilution) followed by IRDye 680RD 
goat anti-rabbit antibody (LI-COR, Lot C71115-11, 1:10,000 dilution). Reactions were performed 
three  times.  Band  intensities  were  quantified,  and  the  relative  fraction  of  phosphorylated 
MOB1AD15 determined by dividing the intensity of the pT35 band by the intensity of the Coomassie 
band and normalizing to the fraction pT35 for wild-type MST2-K. 
 
General Tissue Culture 
HEK293T cells (ATCC, VA) were cultured in DMEM:F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented 
with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (VWR) and 2mM Glutamine (Gibco) and grown at  37°C in 5%CO .

Cells were transfected with indicated plasmids using polyethyleimine “MAX” (Polysciences)(43).  
 
Image Quantification and Statistical Analysis.  
 Both Coomassie stained gels and Western blots were scanned on an Odyssey Infrared 
Imaging System (LI-COR) barring avidity immunoprecipitations of MST2 variants in Figures 4,5 
and Figure S2 which were imaged on a GBox (Syngene). Band intensities were quantified using 
ImageJ(38). Statistical analysis and plotting of data was performed in Prism (GraphPad software, 
La Jolla California, USA).
