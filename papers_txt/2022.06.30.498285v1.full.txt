ABSTRACT 
  Intramuscular fatty infiltration in muscle injuries and diseases, caused by aberrant adipogenesis of fibro-
adipogenic progenitors, negatively impacts function. Intramuscular delivery of Wnt7a offers a promising strategy 
to stimulate muscle regeneration but its effects on adipogenic conversion of fibro-adipogenic progenitors remain 
unknown. Here we show that Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs through the alternative Wnt-Rho-YAP/TAZ 
signaling that subsequently upregulates the canonical Wnt pathway. Furthermore, intramuscular injection of 
Wnt7a in vivo effectively suppresses fatty infiltration in mice. Our results collectively suggest Wnt7a as a potential 
protein-based therapeutic for inhibiting adipogenesis of FAPs and intramuscular fatty infiltration in pathological 
muscle injuries or diseases.

INTRODUCTION 
Persistent fatty infiltration is a common hallmark of chronic skeletal muscle injuries and diseases that 
negatively impacts function and poses significant health and socioeconomic burden (Minagawa et al., 2013; 
Yamamoto et al., 2010). For example, in rotator cuff injuries, irreversible fatty infiltration is prevalent in the 
associated muscles, which directly increases muscle dysfunction and retear rates following surgical repair (Fu 
et al., 2021; Gladstone et al., 2007; Park et al., 2015b). In muscular dystrophies, pervasive intramuscular fatty 
infiltration positively correlates with the disease severity (Li et al., 2015). Fatty infiltration is also common in the 
paraspinal and neck muscles of astronauts following spaceflights (Burkhart et al., 2019; McNamara et al., 2019). 
Recent  evidence  suggests  that  fibro-adipogenic  progenitors  (FAPs),  a  population  of  muscle-resident 
mesenchymal stromal cells, are the primary cellular culprit that generates intramuscular fatty infiltration (Joe et 
al., 2010; Liu et al., 2016; Uezumi et al., 2010; Wosczyna et al., 2012). Although this link between FAPs and 
fatty  infiltration  is  established,  therapies  that  limit  such  pathologic  fatty  infiltration  without  compromising 
myogenesis currently do not exist.  
FAPs play a critical role in muscle regeneration by secreting paracrine factors that promote activation 
and expansion of muscle stem/satellite cells (Joe et al., 2010; Uezumi et al., 2010; Wosczyna et al., 2012). Upon 
muscle injury, immune cells initially infiltrate the injured space to remove debris and activate both FAPs and 
satellite cells (Butterfield et al., 2006; Heredia et al., 2013; Tidball and Villalta, 2010). As the inflammation 
resolves, TNFα released by macrophages induces apoptotic clearances of FAPs while activated satellite cells 
continue to undergo myogenesis (Lemos et al., 2015). In chronic muscle pathology, however, FAPs undergo 
unchecked proliferation and give rise to adipocytes and myofibroblasts (Lemos et al., 2015). The resulting fatty 
infiltration and fibrosis perturb the highly aligned and organized muscle structure and consequently reduce the 
ability  of  muscles  to  contract  and  regenerate.  Thus,  identifying  molecular  mechanisms  that  regulate  the 
adipogenic conversion of FAPs is critical for establishing strategies to combat pathologic fatty infiltration.  
  Intramuscular delivery of Wingless-type MMTV Integration Site Family 7a (Wnt7a) offers a promising 
strategy to both stimulate muscle regeneration and prevent muscle degeneration (Han et al., 2019; von Maltzahn 
et al., 2012, 2013; Schmidt et al., 2020). Wnt7a promotes myofiber hypertrophy through the non-canonical 
Akt/mTOR pathway and increases the symmetric expansion of muscle satellite cells through the non-canonical 
planar cell polarity pathway (Le Grand et al., 2009; von Maltzahn et al., 2011). In pre-clinical models of Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, Wnt7a administration significantly increases satellite cell quantity, myofiber hypertrophy, 
and muscle strength (von Maltzahn et al., 2012). Controlled delivery of Wnt7a using a bioengineered hydrogel 
also increases satellite cell quantity and myofiber hypertrophy, presenting Wnt7a as an effective therapeutic 
candidate for treating various acute and degenerative muscle conditions (Han et al., 2019). While the past 
findings collectively corroborate that Wnt7a can be used as a potential pro-myogenic therapeutic, the effect of 
Wnt7a on FAPs, and specifically whether it limits adipogenic conversion of FAPs, remains unknown.  
  The objective of this study was to determine the mechanistic effect of Wnt7a on FAPs adipogenic 
conversion. By using freshly isolated primary murine FAPs, we demonstrate that Wnt7a effectively inhibits its 
adipogenesis through the alternative Rho-YAP/TAZ pathway. While Wnt7a does not directly increase nuclear 
localization of β-catenin, Wnt7a-induced nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ increases the production of canonical

Wnt signaling modulators that further suppress adipogenesis. Importantly, Wnt7a treated FAPs adipogenic 
conditions do not adopt a fibroblastic phenotype. Finally, we also show that Wnt7a inhibits intramuscular fatty 
infiltration upon glycerol injury without negatively impacting myogenesis nor causing fibrosis in vivo. Collectively, 
we provide mechanistic evidence that Wnt7a effectively inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs and intramuscular fatty 
infiltration.  
 
RESULTS 
Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs 
To evaluate the effect of Wnt7a on lineage specification of differentiating fibro-adipogenic progenitors 
(FAPs), we carried out a series of in vitro experiments using primary murine FAPs. Primary FAPs (CD31-, CD45-, 
α7 integrin-, Sca-1+) were isolated from the hindlimb muscles of C57Bl6/J mice using previously reported 
methods (Fig. 1A) (Marinkovic et al., 2019). Freshly isolated FAPs express PDGFRα (Fig. 1B), a defining marker 
of murine FAPs (Joe et al., 2010; Uezumi et al., 2010). Primary FAPs uniformly differentiated into myofibroblasts 
characterized by stress fibers expressing α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) when maintained in fibrogenic media 
(Fig. 1C, D; p<0.001); but when maintained in adipogenic media, FAPs homogeneously differentiated into oil 
red O (ORO)+/perilipin-1+ adipocytes (Fig. 1C-F; p<0.001). Collectively, these results confirm the functional 
identity of the isolated primary FAPs to be used in the subsequent experiments. 
  To determine the dose-dependent effect of Wnt7a on the adipogenic potential of FAPs, we seeded freshly 
isolated FAPs in a dish and let the cells proliferate to near confluency for 4 days in growth media. Proliferating 
FAPs were further maintained in growth media (±Wnt7a) or adipogenic differentiation media (±Wnt7a) for 
additional 3-4 days (Fig. 1G). Note, in growth media, the FAPs begin to spontaneously differentiate into both 
myofibroblasts and adipocytes (Joe et al., 2010). In both growth and adipogenic conditions, Wnt7a decreased 
adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1H, I). The dose of 200 ng/ml significantly reduced the formation 
of ORO+ adipocytes compared to the control (0 ng/ml; Fig. 1H, I; p<0.01). Based on this, we chose to use 200 
ng/ml for the subsequent in vitro experiments. 
  To further validate the effect of Wnt7a on the suppression of FAPs adipogenesis, we cultured freshly 
isolated FAPs to near confluency and subsequently maintained the cells in either growth and adipogenic 
differentiation media, with or without 200 ng/ml Wnt7a (Fig. 1G). Note, the dH O vehicle for Wnt7a (0.2% v/v in 
2
media) does not affect FAPs adipogenesis (Supp. Fig. 1). Wnt7a significantly reduced the formation of perilipin-
1+ (lipid droplet-associated protein) adipocytes (Fig. 1J, K; p<0.0001) as well as nuclear activation of PPARγ, a 
master regulator of adipogenesis, compared to the control (Fig. 1L, M; p<0.01). In the adipogenic condition, 
Wnt7a also reduced perilipin-1 and PPARγ expressions to below the mean of spontaneously differentiating 
condition (Fig. 1J-M). Importantly, Wnt7a did not increase the fibrogenic potential of FAPs (Supp. Fig. 2A). In 
the spontaneously differentiating condition, the co-emergence of perilipin-1+ adipocytes and αSMA+ stress fiber-
expressing myofibroblasts was apparent (Supp. Fig. 2A). However, treating FAPs with Wnt7a in the adipogenic 
condition did not promote stress fiber expressing myofibroblasts, indicating that Wnt7a does not promote 
fibrogenesis in vitro (Supp. Fig. 2A). Wnt7a treatment also did not affect cell viability (Supp. Fig. 2B, C). 
Altogether, these results demonstrate that Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs in a dose-dependent manner.

Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs through non-canonical Wnt pathways 
  The canonical Wnt signaling inhibits adipogenesis through suppression of the adipogenic transcription 
factor PPARγ in preadipocytes, marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, and muscle FAPs (Bennett et al., 
2002; Kang et al., 2007; Longo et al., 2004; Moldes et al., 2003; Reggio et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2000). To 
determine if the Wnt7a isoform inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs through the canonical Wnt pathway, we cultured 
freshly isolated FAPs in the growth media for 4 days, then subsequently treated the cells in the adipogenic 
differentiation media containing Wnt7a (200 ng/ml) or the prototypically canonical activator Wnt3a (200 ng/ml) 
for 4 hours (Fig. 2A). FAPs treated in the adipogenic differentiation media containing dH O vehicle and Wnt7a 
2
did not exhibit nuclear localization of β-catenin (Fig. 2B, C; >1000 cells assayed per condition from 3 biological 
replicates; Supp. Fig. 3A). However, brief 4-hour treatment with Wnt3a exhibited significantly increased nuclear 
localization of β-catenin compared to both control and Wnt7a conditions (Fig. 2B, C; p<0.05 vs Wnt7a, p<0.01 
vs control). This suggests that Wnt7a activates β-catenin-independent and non-canonical Wnt pathways in 
primary murine FAPs.  
  To further corroborate this finding, we next sought to inhibit the activity of β-catenin using a small molecule 
inhibitor, PNU-74654. This inhibitor specifically prevents the binding of β-catenin and the T-cell factor, Tcf, in the 
nucleus. In this assay, we found that concentrations beyond 50 μM diminish FAPs proliferation in vitro, and thus 
we chose to use 50 μM for the inhibition study (Supp. Fig. 3B). As expected, inhibiting β-catenin/Tcf binding 
with PNU-74654 significantly increased FAPs adipogenesis compared to the DMSO vehicle control (Fig. 2D, E; 
p<0.01). However, co-treating FAPs with Wnt7a and PNU-74654 resulted in a marked reduction in adipogenesis 
compared to the PNU-74654 condition (Fig. 2D, E; p<0.05). Because Wnt7a does not increase nuclear 
expression of β-catenin (Fig. 2B) but reduces adipogenesis while β-catenin remains inhibited (Fig. 2D), Wnt7a 
may be acting through a non-canonical alternative signaling pathway to suppress FAPs adipogenesis.  
 
Wnt7a maintains cell morphology and induces nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) 
  Actin cytoskeleton disassembly through RhoA-ROCK signaling and subsequent cell shape changes drive 
adipogenic differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line and human stromal stem cells (Chen et al., 
2018; Nobusue et al., 2014). To determine whether Wnt7a inhibits FAPs adipogenesis through modulation of 
cell morphology, we expanded freshly isolated FAPs for 4 days and then cultured the cells in either growth and 
adipogenic differentiation, with or without Wnt7a (Fig. 3A). FAPs in the adipogenic condition (ADM) exhibited 
significantly reduced cell area compared to the growth condition (GM; Fig. 3B, C; p<0.0001). Note that this 
decrease in cell area is also accompanied by elevated levels of nuclear PPARγ (Fig. 3B). In ADM, Wnt7a 
significantly increased cell area and max feret diameter compared to its Wnt7a-free control (Fig. 3B-D; p<0.0001). 
In the spontaneously differentiating growth condition (GM), Wnt7a also significantly increased both cell area and 
max ferret diameter compared to its Wnt7a-free control (Fig. 3B-D; p<0.001). Wnt7a-treated FAPs in ADM also 
exhibited cell area and morphology comparable to FAPs maintained in Wnt7a-free GM (Fig. 3B, C). Therefore, 
these results suggest that Wnt7a in the adipogenic condition prevents the shrinking of cell area and maintains 
morphology. We also note that Wnt7a induced apparent stress fiber formation in GM, but not in ADM (Fig. 3B).

This observation suggests that Wnt7a may potentially promote fibrogenesis of FAPs in a context-dependent 
manner. 
  YAP-1 (Yes-associated protein-1) and its paralogue TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding 
motif) act as biochemical mechanotransducers that convert mechanical cues and resulting cellular changes (e.g., 
cell contractility and shape) into cell-specific transcriptional activities (Dupont et al., 2011). Recent evidence also 
suggests YAP/TAZ also act as downstream modulators of Wnt pathways (Azzolin et al., 2012, 2014; Park et al., 
2015a). Based on such evidence and our observation that Wnt7a inhibits FAPs adipogenesis by maintaining 
cellular shape (Fig. 3B-D), we next questioned whether non-canonical Wnt7a signaling promotes nuclear 
localization of YAP (Fig. 3E). Nearly all proliferating FAPs exhibited higher cytosolic YAP in vitro (Fig. 3F, G). 
Culturing the proliferating FAPs in Wnt7a containing growth (GM) and adipogenic (ADM) media for 4 hours 
significantly  increased  YAP  nuclear-to-cytosolic  ratio  compared  to  their  respective  controls  (Fig.  3F,  G; 
p<0.0001). YAP nuclear localization was also significantly higher in ADM containing Wnt7a compared to GM 
containing Wnt7a (Fig. 3F, G; p<0.0001), suggesting context-dependent responsivity. These results indicate that 
Wnt7a promotes nuclear localization of YAP in proliferating FAPs in vitro.  
  To further determine the effect of prolonged exposure of FAPs to Wnt7a on YAP activity, we cultured 
FAPs in growth (GM) and adipogenic (ADM) conditions with or without Wnt7a supplementation for 3 days (Fig. 
3E). In GM, we observed a bimodal distribution of cells expressing nuclear and cytosolic YAP (Fig. 3H, I), likely 
indicating the bifurcating lineage commitment of FAPs, but Wnt7a significantly increased nuclear localization of 
YAP (Fig. 3H, I; p<0.05). By day 3, FAPs undergoing adipogenesis in ADM uniformly exhibited cytosolic YAP 
(Fig. 3H, I). In ADM, 3-day treatment with Wnt7a significantly increased and retained nuclear YAP compared to 
its control (Fig. 3H, I; p<0.0001). In addition, this Wnt7a treatment also resulted in a comparable distribution of 
cells exhibiting nuclear and cytosolic YAP (i.e., bimodal) with GM without Wnt7a (Fig. 3H, I; p>0.05). Collectively, 
these data suggest that Wnt7a treatment promotes nuclear localization of YAP and continues to retain YAP 
within the nucleus.  
 
Wnt7a promotes YAP nuclear localization through Rho. 
  We next asked whether Wnt7a promotes nuclear localization of YAP through the alternative Wnt signaling 
axis involving Wnt-Frizzled/ROR-Rho GTPases-Lats1/2 (Park et al., 2015a). In the alternative Wnt signaling, 
inhibition of Rho prevents Wnt-induced YAP activation. To mechanistically test this hypothesis, we pretreated 
FAPs in adipogenic media (ADM) containing Rho inhibitor (purified C3 Transferase; CT04) or vehicle (dH O) for 
2
2 hours (Fig. 4A). The cells were further maintained in ADM with or without CT04 and Wnt7a for additional 4 
hours (Fig. 4A). Rho inhibition alone did not significantly affect the nuclear localization of YAP compared to the 
control (Fig. 4B, C), but significantly increased the frequency of cells with “diffuse” YAP (Fig. 4D). Wnt7a 
significantly increased YAP nuclear localization compared to the control (Fig. 4B-D; p<0.001). However, when 
Rho was inhibited, Wnt7a failed to promote nuclear localization of YAP (Fig. 4B, C; p>0.05 vs control; p<0.0001 
vs Wnt7a only). Furthermore, Wnt7a treatment with Rho inhibition resulted in no change in the frequency of 
FAPs exhibiting cytosolic, diffuse, and nuclear YAP compared to CT04 treatment alone (Fig. 4D). In sum, the 
results suggest that Rho is required for Wnt7a-induced activation of YAP in FAPs.

Wnt7a promotes downstream canonical signaling through YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. 
  TAZ, a paralogue of YAP-1, regulates the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells by directly 
repressing PPARγ while activating Runx2 genes (Hong et al., 2005). Furthermore, the repressive role of Wnt/β-
catenin in adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells also has been well-established (Kang et al., 2007). This is 
also validated in muscle FAPs in this study, where inhibiting β-catenin activity with PNU74654 increased 
adipogenesis (Fig. 2D-E). Based on such evidence, we hypothesized that non-canonical Wnt7a increases 
YAP/TAZ activity and subsequently promotes the secretion of modulators of canonical Wnt signaling (e.g., Wnt 
ligands and Dkk1) to cooperatively inhibit adipogenesis. To test this, we treated proliferating FAPs with Wnt7a 
for 1 day in culture and immunostained for TAZ. Wnt7a significantly increased nuclear localization of TAZ (Fig. 
5A-C; p<0.0001), comparable to YAP (Fig. 3E-H). Next, to determine if Wnt7a promotes the secretion of 
modulators of canonical Wnt signaling upon YAP nuclear localization, we treated FAPs treated with Wnt7a for 2 
days and performed gene expression analyses on an array of Wnt-related genes (Fig. 5D). This time point was 
chosen because Wnt7a induces YAP nuclear localization without increasing β-catenin nuclear localization at 4 
hours post-treatment (Fig. 2, 3). Thus, any changes in the canonical Wnt signaling genes after 2-day Wnt7a 
treatment is likely induced following the YAP nuclear localization. We found that Wnt7a significantly upregulated 
several canonical Wnt genes including β-catenin, Wisp1, Fzd, and Wnt9a in FAPs (Fig. 5D-E; p<0.05). Wnt7a 
significantly downregulated DKK1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1; p<0.05), which inhibits Lrp5,6 co-receptors that 
activate the canonical signaling pathway, further supporting our hypothesis. Other upregulated genes include 
Wnt11, Wnt2, Wnt16, Axin2, Wnt6, and Wnt5a. To further corroborate this, we immunolabeled FAPs with anti-
β-catenin 2 days following the Wnt7a treatment. FAPs treated with Wnt7a exhibited significantly increased 
nuclear β-catenin intensity (Fig. 5F; p<0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that Wnt7a first activates 
YAP/TAZ nuclear localization through Rho (Fig. 3-5) and subsequently promotes canonical Wnt signaling (Fig. 
5D, F) to act in an autocrine manner to inhibit adipogenesis (Fig. 7A, B). 
 
Wnt7a suppresses fatty infiltration in skeletal muscle. 
  We next sought to evaluate the efficacy of Wnt7a in suppressing intramuscular fatty infiltration in vivo 
using the glycerol injury model. Intramuscular injection of glycerol stimulates a robust and reproducible fatty 
infiltration without affecting muscle regeneration, thus serving as an excellent proof-of-concept in vivo model to 
evaluate therapeutics targeted for reducing intramuscular adipogenesis (Pisani et al., 2010). To induce injury, 
tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were injected with glycerol (50% v/v). Wnt7a or saline was injected into the belly of 
the injured TA muscles 1-day post-injury (Fig. 6A). The muscles were then harvested 14-day post-injury for 
analyses (Fig. 6A). Glycerol-injured TAs with saline treatment exhibited a severe fatty infiltration, marked by 
perilipin-1 expression within the interstitial space (Fig. 6B; Supp. Fig. 4A). However, glycerol-injured TAs with 
Wnt7a treatment exhibited a significantly reduced perilipin-1 expression (Fig. 6B, C; Supp. Fig. 4A; p<0.05). 
We observed no statistically significant differences in the myofiber area distribution (Fig. 6D, E). We also 
observed no qualitative differences in fibrosis assessed by trichrome staining (Supp. Fig. 4B). These data

collectively show that Wnt7a effectively suppresses intramuscular fatty infiltration in vivo without negatively 
impacting myogenesis nor inducing fibrosis. 
 
DISCUSSION 
  Persistent fatty infiltration is a chronic hallmark of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases, such as rotator 
cuff injuries (Fu et al., 2021). Wnt7a has been emerging as a potential therapeutic for muscle diseases and 
injuries due to its pro-regenerative effects on muscle satellite cells and myofibers (Han et al., 2019; Le Grand et 
al., 2009; von Maltzahn et al., 2011), but its effects on FAPs remain unknown. In this study, we determined the 
mechanistic effect of Wnt7a on adipogenesis of FAPs, which are the precursors to fatty infiltration in skeletal 
muscle pathology (Joe et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2016; Uezumi et al., 2010; Wosczyna et al., 2012). Our data reveal 
that Wnt7a suppresses adipogenesis through the Rho-YAP/TAZ signaling axis that indirectly promote canonical 
Wnt signaling.  
The mechanistic role of canonical Wnt signaling and β-catenin in suppressing adipogenesis is well-
established in other cell types (Bennett et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2007; Longo et al., 2004; Moldes et al., 2003; 
Reggio et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2000). Thus, we first sought to determine if Wnt7a increased nuclear β-catenin 
through the canonical pathway in FAPs. However, Wnt7a did not increase nuclear β-catenin in FAPs (Fig. 2A-
C). Furthermore, Wnt7a remained effective in reducing adipogenesis even when β-catenin activity was inhibited 
using PNU-74654 (Fig. 2D-E), suggesting that Wnt7a acts through a non-canonical pathway. We also observed 
that Wnt7a retained the stellate cellular morphology of FAPs in adipogenic culture conditions while preventing 
adipogenesis (Fig. 3A-D). Based on these findings, we then asked if Wnt7a acts through the alternative Wnt 
signaling,  where  YAP/TAZ  is  activated  through  the  Wnt-Fzd/Ror-Rho  GTPases-Lats1/2  signaling  axis 
independent of β-catenin (Park et al., 2015a). In this study, a brief 4-hour Wnt7a treatment induced nuclear 
localization of YAP in FAPs (Fig. 3E-G). We found that Wnt7a failed to induce nuclear localization of YAP when 
Rho was inhibited using CT04 (Fig. 4). We also confirmed that TAZ concurrently is activated with Wnt7a 
treatment in FAPs (Fig. 5A-C). These data thus suggest that Wnt7a activates YAP/TAZ through Rho-dependent 
alternative Wnt signaling in FAPs. These data also suggest that fatty infiltration that may arise from skeletal 
muscle unloading (Kaneshige et al., 2022) could be compensated by potentially delivering exogenous Wnt7a. 
How does Wnt7a-induced YAP/TAZ nuclear localization inhibit PPARγ and adipogenesis of FAPs? First, 
published evidence suggests that nuclear activity of YAP/TAZ inhibits adipogenesis by repressing PPARγ in 
multiple cell types (Deng et al., 2019; El Ouarrat et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2005; Lorthongpanich et al., 2019; Pan 
et al., 2018). Specifically, TAZ directly represses PPARγ while activating Runx2 genes in mesenchymal stem 
cells (Hong et al., 2005). The same mechanism may also be inhibiting the adipogenesis of FAPs when treated 
with Wnt7a. Second, YAP/TAZ activity and TEAD-induced transcription may trigger the secretion of canonical 
Wnt ligands and inhibitors (Park et al., 2015a). Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a crucial mediator of adipogenesis, 
where its downregulation results in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (Bennett et al., 
2002; Longo et al., 2004; Ross et al., 2000). In this study, we also observed that inhibiting β-catenin activity using 
PNU-74654 increased adipogenesis of FAPs (Fig. 2D, E), suggesting a potential involvement of canonical Wnt 
signaling. Here, we report that while Wnt7a does not immediately activate β-catenin unlike the canonical Wnt3a

(Fig. 2A-C), Wnt7a may indirectly activate the canonical Wnt pathway through YAP/TAZ. Gene expression 
analyses revealed that some Wnt ligands and their effectors (e.g., β-catenin, Wisp1, Fzd, Wnt9a, Wnt11, Wnt2, 
Wnt16, Axin2, Wnt6, and Wnt5a) are upregulated while canonical Wnt pathway suppressors (e.g., Dkk1) are 
downregulated (Fig. 5D-E). We further confirmed that nuclear β-catenin immunostaining intensity was also 
significantly increased after 2 days of Wnt7a stimulation (Fig. 5F). Taken together, Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis 
of FAPs by non-canonically activating YAP/TAZ which subsequently modulates the canonical Wnt pathway to 
suppress PPARγ (Fig. 7B). 
The current study has its limitations. Our current in vitro experiments applied a narrow timeframe in which 
these FAPs are either spontaneously differentiating or induced to differentiate in cell culture settings. Future 
investigations will validate the observed mechanisms using clinically relevant in vivo injury and disease models. 
The cellular identity of the Wnt7a-treated FAPs in vivo is also an important consideration. To further develop 
Wnt7a as therapeutic, potential crosstalk between FAPs and other cell populations should be considered in vivo 
in a context-dependent manner as well. Functional measures, including muscle contractile force, mouse gait, 
and fibrosis, should also be considered to comprehensively evaluate Wnt7a as a potential therapeutic. Ultimately, 
an effective delivery method using biomaterials such as engineered hydrogels should be tested to show the 
effectiveness and efficiency of Wnt7a release on therapeutic models. 
  In conclusion, we identified that Wnt7a inhibits adipogenesis of FAPs through a non-canonical Rho-
YAP/TAZ signaling axis. Our data provide insight into applying Wnt7a as a potential therapeutic for mitigating 
intramuscular fatty infiltration in various skeletal muscle pathologies. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Mice: 
All animal procedures were conducted under the approved protocol by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount 
Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed and maintained in the Center for 
Comparative Medicine and Surgery Facility of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. C57BL/6J mice were 
acquired from the Jackson Laboratory (stock # 000664). Both male and female mice were used in a randomized 
manner. 
 
Glycerol Injuries and Wnt7a Administration: 
2-month-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. 50 µl of 50% glycerol in saline was intramuscularly injected 
into both tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. After 24 hours, 2.5 µg/30 µl of recombinant human Wnt7a (PeproTech) 
and 30 µl of saline were injected into the TA muscles in a randomized manner. Buprenorphine shots were 
subcutaneously administered every 12 hours at the onset of the procedure for 3 days. Mice were sacrificed on 
day 14 for histological analyses. 
 
Isolation of Fibro-Adipogenic Progenitors (FAPs): 
Primary fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) were isolated from 4-6-week-old mice by magnetic-activated cell 
sorting (MACS) as described previously (Marinkovic et al., 2019). Mouse hindlimb muscles were dissected and

incubated in digestion media (2.5 U/mL Dispase II; Thermo and 0.2% w/v Collagenase Type II; Worthington in 
DMEM) on a shaking incubator at 37°C for 1.5 hours. Deactivation media (20% FBS in Ham’s F-10; Gibco) was 
added to inactivate the reaction. The muscle digest was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer, then centrifuged 
(300xg, 5 minutes, 4°C). Cell pellets were resuspended in Staining Buffer (0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin and 2 
mM EDTA in PBS) and filtered through a 35 µm cell strainer. Cells were incubated with Biotin anti-mouse CD31 
(Biolegend; Cat. No. 102503; 1:150), Biotin anti-mouse CD45 (Biolegend; Cat. No. 103103; 1:150), and Biotin 
anti-integrin α7 (Miltenyi; Cat. No. 130-101-979; 1:10) antibodies at 4°C for 45 minutes. Cells were pelleted 
through centrifugation and incubated with 10 µl Streptavidin beads (1:30) at 4°C for 15 minutes. Labeled cells 
were passed through an LD column (Miltenyi) for negative selection. The remaining cells were incubated with 
Biotin anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (Sca-1) antibody (Biolegend; Cat. No. 122504; 1:75) at 4°C for 20 minutes then 10 µl 
Streptavidin beads (1:30) at 4°C for 10 minutes. Cells were then passed through an LS column (Miltenyi) and 
enriched for Sca-1+ cells. Cells were filtered through a 35 µm cell strainer once more before cell seeding. 
 
FAPs Culture and Differentiation: 
Isolated FAPs were seeded at ~10,000 cells per 1.0 cm2 well in Growth Media (10% FBS and 1x Penicillin-
Streptomycin in DMEM) containing 2.5 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech) on laminin (Gibco; 10 µg/mL) and collagen I 
(ThermoFisher; 5 µg/mL) coated plates. Cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO  levels. Adipogenic 
2
differentiation was performed by incubating the FAPs in Adipogenic Differentiation Media: 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-
methylxanthine  (MilliporeSigma),  0.25  µM  Dexamethasone  (MilliporeSigma),  and  1  µg/mL  insulin 
(MilliporeSigma) in Growth Media, and Adipogenic Maintenance Media: 1 µg/mL insulin in Growth Media. 
Fibrogenic differentiation was performed by incubating the FAPs in Fibrogenic Media: 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 
(Peprotech) in Growth Media.  
 
In Vitro Assays and Reagents: 
Unless otherwise noted, recombinant human Wnt7a (PeproTech; 200 ng/mL; vehicle: dH O) was added to the 
2
culture media. To inhibit β-catenin binding to Tcf4, PNU-74654 (Cayman Chemicals; 50 µM; vehicle: DMSO) 
was added to the media for 3 days plus an additional day in Adipogenic Maintenance Media. To inhibit Rho, 
CT04 (Cytoskeleton; 2 µg/mL; vehicle: dH O) was added to the media for 2 hours as pre-treatment plus an 
2
additional 4 hours with or without Wnt7a.  
 
Real-Time Quantitative PCR: 
mRNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Plus Microkit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 74034) and cDNA was prepared 
using RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 330401). RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen; Cat. No. 
330504) and RT2 Profiler PCR Array Mouse WNT Signaling Pathway ABI 7900HT Standard Block plates 
(Qiagen; Cat. No. PAMM-043ZA) were used for qPCR.

A11003; 1:500). Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher; 1:1000) and Phalloidin-iFluor 488 (Cayman Chemicals; 1:1000) 
were used to stain nuclei and F-actin, respectively. 
 
Oil Red O Staining: 
Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 minutes at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with 1x 
PBS and incubated in blocking/permeabilization buffer (5.0% goat serum, 2.0% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% 
Triton X-100 in PBS) overnight at 4°C. Cells were incubated in isopropanol (60%) for 5 min then incubated in Oil 
Red O for 20 min. Cells were washed five times with 1x PBS and then counterstained with Hoechst 33342 
(ThermoFisher; 1:1000). 
 
Histology and Immunohistochemistry:  
Hindlimbs were dissected and fixed for 1 hour at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed TA 
muscles were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen chilled isopentane. 10 µm sections were obtained from the 
frozen TAs using a cryotome. Tissue sections were incubated using blocking/permeabilization buffer (5.0% goat 
serum, 2.0% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. The following 
primary and secondary antibodies were used for tissue immunohistochemistry in this study: anti-perilipin (Abcam; 
ab3526;  1:200)  and  goat  anti-rabbit  Alexa  Fluor  488  (ThermoFisher;  A11008;  1:500).  Hoechst  33342 
(ThermoFisher; PI62249; 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher; A22287; 1:1000) were used to 
stain nuclei and F-actin, respectively. Tissue sections were also processed for routine H&E and trichrome 
staining.  
 
Imaging and Image Analysis:

Figure  7.  Wnt7a  activates  YAP/TAZ  through  Rho  and  inhibits  FAPs  adipogenesis.  (A)  YAP/TAZ 
translocates  to  nucleus  in  activated  and  proliferating  FAPs.  During  adipogenic  differentiation,  YAP/TAZ 
translocates to cytosol. Wnt7a promotes nuclear translocation and continues to retain YAP/TAZ within the 
nucleus, thereby preventing FAPs adipogenesis. (B) Wnt7a may rescue mechanical unloading induced FAPs 
adipogenesis by reinforcing YAP/TAZ activity through cell contractility mediated mechanisms.
