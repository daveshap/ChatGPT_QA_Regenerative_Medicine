1. Introduction 
Regenerative medicine is a rapidly developing of medicine incorporating di-
verse but integrated fields of stem cells, bioscaffolds, biomarkers, molecular 
epigenetics and DNA editing. Substantial research on regenerative medicine 
has focused on replacing diseased tissues and organs such as heart, liver, kid-
neys and pancreas [1]. The use of regenerative medicine technology for treat-
ing cosmetic problems is gaining popularity in many parts of Asia and western 
countries. China, Japan and South Korea have large percentages of the general 
population  with  disposable  incomes  for  spending  on  high  quality  health

treatments and cosmetic services. Current cosmetic treatments of the face and 
head region include surgical facelifts, hair transplantation, cheek and chin 
augmentation, removal of wrinkles and aging lines, injections of fillers and 
botulinum. 
Other applications show a crossover of medical and cosmetic medicine such 
as burns victims and with difficult decision-making placed on immediate rela-
tives [2]. The regenerative approach to treat the skin of burn victims is most 
important for improved outcomes on both the psychological and physical func-
tional dimensions of afflicted patients. Developing in parallel to these treatments 
is the cosmetic field, particularly on skin regeneration to obtain a more youthful 
appearance. Facial and neck aesthetics have major importance in a large percen-
tage of the population, especially women, but with an increasing awareness and 
utilization of cosmetic products by men. This can be observed in the time taken 
by people to apply makeup and style hair. Looking young has important positive 
psychological benefits that translate into better physical and emotional health, 
and better employment prospects in many industries. In contrast, there can be 
significant psychological comorbidities in people with facial conditions request-
ing regenerative treatments [3]. 
Facial wrinkles, deepening neck lines and hair loss are obvious cosmetic 
markers of ageing. The cause can be genetic conditions such as progeria or more 
frequent ultraviolet damage to skin causing loss of elastin and collagen resulting 
in wrinkles and skin cancer [4]. The cosmetic market for face and neck im-
provement is measured in tens of billions of dollars each year in the world. More 
medical doctors are focusing their attention specifically to cosmetic medicine, 
and the public now commits significant time and money to investigate and use 
cosmetic medicine. 
Current treatment for removal of neck lines includes plastic surgery but this 
can cause undesirable effects such as a stretched skin appearance and leave visi-
ble scar lines at the surgical incision sites. This can result in a psychologically 
devastated patient. Moreover, further surgery is more difficult due to loss of 
available tissue volume and increased scar tissue formation. Cosmetic outcomes 
from failed plastic surgery can be irreversible. Other treatments include cosmetic 
fillers, thermofrequency and lasers on deep neck and face lines that give tempo-
rary benefit, are painful, or require multiple attempts. 
This case report demonstrates the remarkable outcome of utilizing regenera-
tive medicine for the treatment of multiple neck lines. Our protocol combined 
autologous adipose tissue derived stem cells with a new scientifically designed 
topical serum to augment the stem cell differentiation. The serum was formu-
lated to be a highly absorbent topical serum for skin and was applied several 
times each day after the stem cell injections. The purpose of this serum was for 
the bioactive compounds to penetrate skin and promote the stem cells to fibrob-
lasts for expression of collagen and elastin to give a more permanent and natural 
looking effect.

2. Case Presentation 
A 37-year-old Chinese female in good health sought treatment for extensive and 
multiple neck lines. Her occupation was a professional singer and the appear-
ance of neck lines was affecting her psychologically and employment prospects. 
Photos of the neck only were taken to maintain anonymity and were recorded at 
baseline, and postoperatively at 2 days, 5 days and 5 weeks. The subject gave 
permission for the images to be used for research publication purposes. 
The stem cell therapy used a variation of the technique previously published 
by the author using stem cells for facial pain and inflammation [5]. In addition, a 
cosmetic biochemistry approach was included. This consisted of daily self admi-
nistered applications of a highly absorbable topical serum with a novel formula-
tion of bioactive compounds with stem cell signaling properties. 
Tumescent liposuction was used to acquire autologous adipose mesenchymal 
stem cells. Preoperatively the subject was given 1 gm oral systemic cephalosporin 
antibiotics. The subject was draped and skin antiseptic applied to the abdominal 
region. 10 ml of local anesthetic (2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenalin) was 
mixed with 10 ml 0.9% normal saline. A small scalpel incision was performed 
through the dermis and a 10cm 14 gauge liposuction cannula with a blunt end 
and internal cutting edge was inserted. Manual suction was accomplished with a 
50 ml syringe and a plunger lock mechanism to maintain vacuum. 7 gm of tu-
mescent lipoaspirate was obtained and then subjected to manual passaging to 
emulsify the fat. The emulsified product was vortexed at high speed for 4 min 
and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm at room temperature 20˚C. The 
cellular stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was removed and reconstituted in 10 ml 
of normal saline. Surgery was performed by author ERV (maxillofacial surgeon) 
and technical procedures performed by author HW. 
The neck lines were injected with local anaesthetic in small 0.1 ml volume in-
crements. The SVF containing stem cells was injected intradermally along the 
neck lines with a 25 gauge needle. The subject was given the topical serum for-
mulation and instructed to apply to the neck lines twice daily for 4 weeks. 
The subject reported no adverse effects or complications from the procedure. 
There was minor visible redness and swelling of the neck lines at the injections 
sites for 2 days. There was minimal discomfort and no analgesics were taken by 
the subject. There was rapid and visible improvement of the necklines at 5 days 
and the reduction of neck lines continued for 5 weeks. The subject was very sa-
tisfied with the result (Figures 1-4). 
3. Discussion 
Consensus among scientists is the using of multimodal regenerative techniques 
applicable to the target tissue or organ. Specific for this case of skin neck lines 
was the administration of stem cells directly to the target site to precisely locate 
the stem cells. This is a straightforward and simple medical approach using 23 - 
25 gauge needle. The surgical protocol was adapted from our previous work to

increase efficiency and safety of the technique. All surgical components and ma-
terials were sterile and disposable, preventing cross contamination and post 
operative infection with micro-organisms such as antibiotic resistant staphylo-
coccus found on the face. The SVF is performed under a closed loop system to 
prevent infection. This was followed by use of small benchtop vortex mixer and 
centrifuge. The laboratory equipment is standardized and portable. No expen-
sive equipment such as a biosafety cabinet was required. In addition, there was a

significant cost reduction as no collagenase was used for enzymatic digest of the 
fat. 
The topical cream was specifically formulated with known bioactive com-
pounds to enhance cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation. Most of these 
compounds have shown in vitro and ex vivo effects in the published literature. 
Moreover, the compounds are very safe and are found in foods, particularly 
herbs such as green tea and its polyphenol key active of epigallocatechin gallate. 
Many polyphenols are lipophilic and require solvents, emulsifiers and surfac-
tants that are suitable for oil in water topical creams. We have achieved this ap-
proach using novel natural solvents based on molecular cell membrane lipid 
transport mechanisms. This achieved excellent solubility of lipid polyphenols in 
the serum without having to use synthetic chemicals that may cause local in-
flammation, thereby negating stem cell signaling to the local niche of skin resi-
dent stem cells. We are further enhancing this serum for wider applications in 
cosmetic and regenerative medicine. 
The pathogenesis of wrinkles is complex. At the microstructural level there is 
depletion of elastin and collagen that macroscopically and aesthetically results in 
wrinkles and sagging of tissue. In addition, dysregulation of lymphatic vessels 
and surrounding perilymphatic fat in the dermis leads to inflammation, scarring, 
and fibrosis [6]. Biochemically, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs - collagenase 
enzymes) degrade collagen. Previous research (photoaged rat model) has shown 
injections of cultured fibroblasts increase collagen but also increase MMPs. In-
jections of adipose stem cells, however, increased collagen and decreased MMPs 
[7] suggesting that stem cells are the preferred cell type for clinical use. Moreo-
ver, adipose stem cells have a repertoire of anti-inflammatory cytokines in their 
secretome increasing the immunomodulatory paracrine effect of the dysregu-
lated cellular matrix in wrinkles [8]. 
4. Conclusions 
This case report demonstrates the approach of integrating different areas of the 
regenerative medicine field to achieve a significant improvement on skin aes-
thetics [9]. The average cost of a neck lift is $5242, according to 2018 statistics 
from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons [10] and involves general anaes-
thesia and significant bruising and swelling of the neck for several weeks. It is 
obvious to the patient’s personal friends and can create unnecessary negative 
comments. Similar issues exist for a surgical face lift ($7655) [10]. Furthermore, 
in conventional surgery of the neck and face, there are the potential major im-
plications and complications of paresis and paraesthesia to the cosmetic patient 
due to the superficial proximity of motor branches of the facial nerve and sen-
sory divisions of the trigeminal nerve [11]. 
In contrast, our described surgical protocol was simple, safe and effective. 
Importantly, the new technique maintained the patient’s privacy of having a 
cosmetic procedure. Postoperatively, it was not obvious to other work related

people and friends. The topical serum formulation was developed by using a 
novel combination of bioactive compounds with enhanced skin penetration 
chemistry. The described regenerative medicine methodology is applicable for 
further applications of cosmetic medicine.
