Abstract: 
Immune cells sense their microenvironment to fine-tune their inflammatory responses. Patients 
with cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene, 
present auto-inflammation. However, its manifestation is largely dependent on environmental cues 
20  through so far unknown mechanisms. Here, we link PIEZO-mediated mechanotransduction to 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Yoda1, a PIEZO1 agonist, dramatically lowers the threshold 
for  NLRP3  inflammasome  activation.  PIEZO-mediated  stiffness-sensing  increases  NLRP3-
dependent inflammatory responses. Activation of PIEZO1 triggers calcium influx, which activates 
KCNN4, a calcium-activated potassium channel, to evoke potassium efflux promoting NLRP3 
25  inflammasome activation. Activation of PIEZO1 is sufficient to activate the inflammasome in cells 
expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants in a KCNN4-dependent manner. We thus propose that 
PIEZO-dependent mechanosensing is essential for triggering auto-inflammation in CAPS. 
 
One Sentence Summary: PIEZO-dependent mechanotransduction stimulates KCNN4-dependent 
30  potassium efflux to potentiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Main Text: 
Immune cells primarily respond to pathogen exposure using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 
to elicit an inflammatory response (1, 2). However, it is increasingly recognized that other 
parameters in the microenvironment alter in the course of inflammation and that innate immune 
5  cells are capable to adapt their responses to those variations. More recently, changes in immune 
cell activation in response to mechanical cues has been put forward. It has been demonstrated that 
impaired  PIEZO1-dependent  mechanosensation  in  myeloid  cells  alters  their  inflammatory 
response (3–6). While these studies primarily linked PIEZO1 signaling to transcription of cytokine 
and chemoattractant, we asked the question whether mechanotransduction has an impact on pattern 
10  recognition receptor activation itself. The intracellular NLRP3 inflammasome receptor was one 
potential candidate given its capacity to detect a remarkable variety of environmental cues (7–10). 
Moreover, gain of function mutations in the NLRP3 gene lead to the development of Cryopyrin-
Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), an auto-inflammatory condition that often occurs at 
joints and eyes, highly mechanical sites, and that can be triggered via cold exposure (11). 
15  NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two principal steps, priming through Toll-like or 
cytokine receptor signaling resulting in robust expression of the inflammasome components and 
activation leading to inflammasome complex assembly (7–10). Assembly includes recruitment of 
the adaptor protein ASC that binds pro-Caspase-1, leading to self-activation of Caspase-1. Active 
Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms promoting their secretion and 
20  also cleaves Gasdermin D triggering pro-inflammatory lytic cell death, called pyroptosis (7–10). 
We  wondered  whether  PIEZO-mediated  mechanotransduction  alters  NLRP3  inflammasome 
activation. To this end, we used Yoda1, a PIEZO1 agonist (12), and THP-1 cells, a human acute 
leukemia monocytic cell line widely used for assessing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. THP-1 
cells in suspension were primed with LPS and exposed to nigericin to activate the NLRP3 
25  inflammasome in absence or presence of Yoda1. Yoda1 significantly enhanced susceptibility of 
THP-1 cells to nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by increased 
amounts of cleaved and secreted IL-1β and Caspase-1 in supernatants measured by ELISA and/or 
Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and 1B) and enhanced pyroptosis determined by Sytox Green uptake 
(Fig. 1C). Nigericin induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a potassium efflux-dependent 
30  manner (13), we thus wondered if it was the same with potassium efflux-independent activators, 
imiquimod R837 and its derivative CL097 (14). Yoda1 also dramatically lowered the threshold of 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to R837 or its derivative CL097 (fig. S1, A-F). No 
induction of pyroptosis was observed in NLRP3 knockout (KO) THP-1 cells (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C, 
S1F) confirming that Yoda1-induced potentiation was NLRP3-dependent. The release of cleaved 
35  IL-1β and Caspase-1 in response to LPS plus nigericin, R837 or CL097 were also markedly 
enhanced in Yoda1-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as compared 
to control-treated cells (fig. S1, G-L). In line with previous study (4), Yoda1 treatment also slightly 
enhanced the production of TNFα, which is not directly linked to inflammasome activation. 
Formation of ASC specks is a hallmark of cells in which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated 
40  (15). LPS-primed BMDMs stimulated with nigericin (Fig. 1D), R837 (fig. S1, M and N) or CL097 
(fig. S1, M and N) showed significantly enhanced cell numbers containing ASC specks when co-
treated with Yoda1 as compared to cells without Yoda1 treatment. Yoda1 had no such effect on 
activation of the AIM2-, or pyrin inflammasome (fig. S2, A and B). 
To confirm that the effect of Yoda1 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was PIEZO-dependent, 
45  we next generated PIEZO1 KO, PIEZO2 KO and PIEZO1/2 double knockout (dKO) THP-1 cells 
using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Deletion of either gene in THP1 cells was confirmed

using Sanger sequencing (fig. S3, A-C). Yoda1-induced potentiation of inflammasome activation 
in response to nigericin (fig. S4, A-C), R837 (fig. S4, D-F) or CL097 (fig. S4, G-I) was abolished 
in PIEZO1 KO and PIEZO1/2 dKO cells but not in PIEZO2 KO cells, confirming that effects of 
Yoda1 occur through PIEZO1 activation. Deletion of both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 did not affect 
5  canonical inflammasome activation in response to nigericin, R837 or CL097 in the absence of 
Yoda1 (fig. S5, A-I). Re-expression of PIEZO1 in PIEZO1 KO THP-1 cells restored the increased 
sensitivity to inflammasome activation in response to nigericin (Fig. 1, F-H), R837 (fig. S6, A-C) 
or CL097 (fig. S6, D-F). We next generated wild type (WT) and NLRP3 KO THP-1 cells 
ectopically expressing PIEZO1. In WT cells ectopically expressing PIEZO1, Yoda1 was sufficient 
10  to trigger cleavage and secretion of IL-1β and Caspase-1 as well as pyroptosis; while Yoda1 didn’t 
show such effects in NLRP3 KO cells ectopically expressing PIEZO1 (fig. S7, A-C). 
PIEZO1 senses microenvironmental stiffness modulating macrophage function (3–5). THP-1 cells 
cultured on stiff substrates secreted more IL-1β than cells cultured on soft substrates in response 
to nigericin and R837 (Fig. 1I). Deletion of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 attenuated the secretion of IL-
15  1β triggered by nigericin and R837 in cells cultured on stiff substrates (Fig. 1I). A reduction of 
secretion of IL-1β was also observed in PIEZO1/2 dKO cells cultured on soft substrates (Fig. 1I). 
Our data thus demonstrate that PIEZO1 activation or PIEZO protein-mediated stiffness-sensing 
lowers the threshold for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 
Activation of PIEZO channels evoke cellular Ca2+ influx (16). We thus monitored cytosolic Ca2+ 
20  level  using  a  genetically-encoded  fluorescent  Ca2+  indicator,  jGCaMP7S  (17),  in  WT  and 
PIEZO1/2 dKO THP-1 cells treated with R837 in absence or presence of Yoda1. Increase of 
cytosolic Ca2+ levels occurred in presence of Yoda1 in WT cells but not when treated with R837 
alone (fig. S8A). In contrast, cells lacking PEIZO1 and PIEZO2 did not show obvious increase of 
cytosolic Ca2+ in response to Yoda1 or R837 plus Yoda1 (fig. S8A). We then asked whether 
25  potentiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by Yoda1 was Ca2+ influx-dependent. To this 
end, we compared the effect of Yoda1 in THP-1 cells treated in culture medium with or without 
Ca2+. Indeed, enhanced IL-1β and Caspase-1 release and pyroptosis in presence of Yoda1 in R837 
and CL097-treated cells were significantly decreased when cells were treated in Ca2+-free medium 
as  compared  to  cells  treated  in  Ca2+-containing  medium  (fig.  S8,  B-G).  Thus,  Ca2+  influx 
30  contributes to PIEZO1-mediated potentiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 
What is the mechanism by which PIEZO1-mediated Ca2+ influx amplifies NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation? To address this question, we have chosen to perform a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated knockout screen in THP-1 cells stably expressing Cas9 using the human CRISPR 
Brunello lentiviral pooled sgRNA library (18). We used R837 to induce NLRP3 inflammasome 
35  activation  to  set  up  this  screen.  To  obtain  hits  specifically  related  to  PIEZO1-dependent 
mechanisms of inflammasome activation, we have chosen a R837 concentration in which co-
treatment with R837 and Yoda1 led to approximately 85% cell death, while stimulation with R837 
alone resulted in basic level (10 to 15%) of cell death. R837 plus Yoda1-induced cell death was 
applied twice to ensure maximal elimination of Yoda1-sensitive cells. For the assessment of 
40  enrichment of sgRNAs, co-treated cells were compared to vehicle control-treated cells (Fig. 2A). 
In this screen, NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD) and PIEZO1 were identified as top hits as expected. In 
addition, ATP11A and CDC50A (TMEM30A), which were reported to directly mediate PIEZO1 
activation on membranes (19), were also identified. Very intriguingly, KCNN4, a calcium-
activated potassium channel which was reported to act downstream of PIEZO1 in red blood cell 
45  (20), was the first-ranked hit. We further validated the involvement of KCNN4 in this context 
using both genetical and pharmacological approaches. Deletion of KCNN4 using CRISPR/Cas9-

mediated gene editing in THP-1 cells (fig. S9) attenuated the enhancing effect of Yoda1 on R837-
induced pyroptosis, cleavage and secretion of IL-1β and Caspase-1 (Fig. 2, B-D and fig. S10, A-
C). Re-expression of EGFP-tagged KCNN4 restored the enhancing effect of Yoda1 on NLRP3 
inflammasome activation in KCNN4 KO cells (Fig. 2, B-D). In line with previous results obtained 
5  in PIEOZ1/2 dKO cells, deletion of KCNN4 didn’t affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation 
induced by nigericin, R837 or CL097 alone (fig. S11, A-F). Consistently, pharmacological 
inhibition of KCNN4 by TRAM-34 (21) similarly inhibited pyroptosis, cleavage and secretion of 
IL-1β and Caspase-1 induced by R837 plus Yoda1 in THP-1 cells (fig. S12, C-E). Similar results 
were also obtained in BMDMs (fig. S11, F and G). To further consolidate the role of KCNN4-
10  mediated potassium efflux mediating the effect of Yoda1 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we 
blocked potassium efflux by increasing extracellular potassium concentrations and assessed its 
effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In line with previous studies (13, 14, 22), increasing 
extracellular  potassium  concentrations  completely  blocked  nigericin-induced,  but  not  R837-
induced pyroptosis, cleavage and secretion of IL-1β and Caspase-1 (Fig. 2, E-G and fig. S12A, 
15  S12B). However, increasing extracellular potassium concentrations completely blocked enhancing 
effects of Yoda1 on R837-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Fig. 2, E-G and fig. S12, C-
G). These results suggest that potassium efflux via KCNN4 mediates the enhancing effect of 
PIEZO1 activation on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 
In CAPS patients, auto-activation of NLRP3 inflammasome occurs in absence of infection or 
20  tissue injury (11). However, inflammation occurs at sites of mechanical impact and in response to 
cold exposure (11). We thus asked whether PIEZO-dependent mechanotransduction was important 
in triggering auto-activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in CAPS patients. To this end, we 
expressed three CAPS-causing NLRP3 (mouse) mutants, D301N, T346M and R258W, in NLRP3-
deficient THP-1 cells. NLRP3-deficient cells expressing WT NLRP3 or GFP and WT cells 
25  expressing GFP were used as controls. Expression of NLRP3 and GFP was confirmed by Western 
blotting (fig. S13B). Pyroptotic cell death was determined by propidium iodide incorporation. In 
line with previous studies (23–26), cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants displayed 
significantly enhanced pyroptosis in response to LPS alone as compared to control-treated cells 
and LPS-treated control cells (fig. S13A). Importantly, Yoda1 stimulation was sufficient to induce 
30  pyroptosis in CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants expressing cells as compared to control-treated cells 
(Fig. S13A). Similar to LPS treatment, Yoda1 had only minor effects on induction of pyroptosis 
in control cells (fig. S13, A and B). We next expressed GFP, WT NLRP3 and CAPS-causing 
NLRP3  mutants in WT, PIEZO1  KO,  PIEZO2 KO and  PIEZO1/2 dKO  THP-1 cells. The 
expression of NLRP3 and GFP was confirmed by Western blotting (fig. S13C). LPS-induced 
35  pyroptosis in cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants was not dependent on PIEZO1 or 
PIEZO2 as the response was unaltered in PIEZO1 KO, PIEZO2 KO and PIEZO1/2 dKO cells (fig. 
S13D). However, Yoda1-induced pyroptosis in cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants 
depended on PIEZO1 expression (Fig. 3A). We further tested whether PIEZO1-dependent activity 
was KCNN4-dependent. Indeed, inhibition of KCNN4 dramatically inhibited Yoda1-induced 
40  inflammasome activation in these cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Mice carrying the NLRP3A350V mutation 
develop CAPS-like symptoms (24). To test whether activation of PIEZO1 is sufficient to activate 
inflammasome  in  cells  endogenously  expressing  a  CAPS-causing  NLRP3  mutant,  liver 
macrophages were isolated from these mice. Cells were primed with low dose of LPS to ensure 
the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β and further treated with Yoda1. Low dose of LPS induced 
45  moderate secretion of IL-1β as expected (Fig. 3D). Treatment of Yoda1 potentiated secretion of 
IL-1β, while no IL-1β was detected in control cells under tested conditions (Fig. 3D). Importantly,

inhibition of KCNN4 attenuated Yoda1-induced inflammasome activation in these cells (Fig. 3D). 
Thus,  activation  of  PIEZO1  by  Yoda1  is  sufficient  to  activate  the  inflammasome  in  cells 
expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants. Altogether, our results suggest that KCNN4 acts 
downstream of PIEZO1-induced Ca2+ influx to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a 
5  mechanism that may contribute to environmental effects on severity of CAPS. 
Immune cells including macrophages are constantly exposed to microenvironmental changes, such 
as  shear  stress  in  the  circulation  during  extravasation,  membrane  reorganization  during 
transmigration, hydrostatic pressure in blood vessels, lung and heart (27). These changes redirect 
their responses to physiological and pathological cues (27). The NLRP3 inflammasome plays 
10  critical roles in innate immune responses detecting various endogenous and exogenous danger 
signals.  In  this  study,  we  have  provided  a  direct  link  between  PIEZO  protein-mediated 
mechanosensing and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent immune response. Activation of PIEZO1 
lowers the threshold of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in presence of its activators. However, 
activation of PIEZO1 by Yoda1 is not sufficient to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in wild type 
15  THP-1 cells and BMDMs. However, boosting PIEZO1-signalling by overexpressing PIEZO1 and 
subsequent Yoda1 treatment was sufficient to activate NLRP3 inflammasome. Persistence of 
mechanical cues are therefore likely to boost NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response in vivo. We 
identified KCNN4 to act downstream of PIEZO protein-mediated calcium influx and to promote 
NLRP3 inflammasome. Several studies have shown that intracellular Ca2+ signaling is involved in 
20  NLRP3 inflammasome activation (28–30). But the mechanism underlying remained unclear. 
KCNN4 represents a valid link between Ca2+ signaling and potassium efflux, the latter constituting 
an established prerequisite in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to most stimuli. In 
CAPS patients, inflammation is often more prominent in eyes, joints and bones, sites harboring 
movement-associated  mechanical  properties.  Moreover,  urticaria  seen  in  CAPS  patients  is 
25  frequently cold-induced. In this study, we discovered that PIEZO1 signaling is sufficient to 
activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants. Thus, 
targeting of this pathway may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of CAPS patients 
and potentially other NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases.

For the generation of PIEZO1 KO, PIEZO2 KO, PIEZO1/2 double knockout (dKO) and KCNN4 
KO THP-1 cell lines, two sgRNAs (sgRNA 1 and sgRNA 2) for each gene were designed and 
cloned into pX330-P2A-EGFP or pX330-P2A-RFP, respectively, using T4 ligation. THP-1 cells 
were transfected with mixture of two sgRNAs-expressing plasmids (0.5 µg each) using X-
tremeGENE 9 according to the manufacturer’s manual. 24 h after transfection, GFP and RFP 
double-positive cells were sorted and collected using BD FACS Aria™ III Cell Sorter. Single cell 
colonies were obtained by seeding into 96-well plates via series of dilution. The sequences of 
sgRNAs are listed below:

Cell culture  
THP-1, mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and HEK293t cell lines 
were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2. THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplement with 
10 mM HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2.5 g/l glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, gentamycin 
and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. HEK293t cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/ml glucose) supplement 
with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin. BMDMs were differentiated from bone 
marrow progenitors isolated from the tibia and femur in DMEM (4,5g/l glucose) supplement with 
50 ng/ml recombinant hM-CSF, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin 
for 7 days. For treatment of cells, BMDMs and THP-1 cells were primed with 1 µg/mL LPS for 
3 h, followed by the treatment of nigericin, Imiquimod and CL097 in presence or absence of 25 µM 
Yoda1. For treatment of inhibitor, cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 45 min and followed by 
stimulation in presence of inhibitor. To assess the involvement of K+ efflux, LPS-primed cells 
were treated with NLRP3 inflammasome activator in the culture medium supplemented with 5 
mM, 15 mM, 25 mM, or 35 mM KCl. For the experiments with calcium-free medium, BMDMs 
and THP-1 cells were primed with 1 µg/mL LPS for 3h in DMEM (4,5g/l glucose) containing 10% 
FCS, cells were washed once with PBS before treatment with nigericin, R837 or CL097 in DMEM 
(4,5g/l  glucose)  without  calcium  containing  10%  dialyzed  FCS.  For  the  stiffness-related 
experiments, cells seeded on silicone gels of 0.2 Kpa and 64 Kpa (5165-5EA and 5145-5EA, 
Sigma-Aldrich) with culture medium containing 100 nM PMA for 3 h, followed by replacement 
of fresh medium and incubation at 37 ℃ overnight. On the next day, cells were treated with 
nigericin or R837.

Immunoblotting 
Both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting. For cell lysates, cells 
were lysed on ice with 1× RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 
mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaVO4, 1.5 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM 
β-Glycerophosphate)  supplemented  with  protease  inhibitor  cocktail.  The  immunoblot  was 
prepared using Glycine SDS-PAGE gels. For the supernatants, the proteins were extracted using 
methanol-chloroform precipitation protocol as previously described (26), separated by Tricine 
SDS-PAGE  and  analyzed  by  immunoblotting.  The  PVDF  membranes  were  incubated  with 
primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After 3 times washes with TBS-T, membranes were incubated 
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT. Membranes were again washed with 
TBS-T  for  3  times  and  were  incubated  with  Immobilon  Forte  Western  HRP  substrate 
(WBLUF0500, EMD Millipore Corporation). Images were captured using AI600 Imager from GE 
Healthcare Life Science. 
Flow cytometry 
For analysis of lytic cell death, after treatments, THP-1 cells were spin down and resuspended in 
cold PBS with 1 µM of Sytox Green or propidium iodide (PI). Sytox Green- or PI- positive cells 
were analyzed by BD FACS Celesta™ Flow Cytometer. For cell sorting, THP-1 cells were spin 
down and resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 1% of fetal calf serum, followed by sorting 
at sterile condition using BD FACS Aria™ III Cell Sorter in fresh medium for further culture. 
Measurement cytokines using ELISA 
IL-1β and TNFα levels in collected culture supernatants were determined by ELISA according to 
the user’s manual. Human IL-1 beta/IL-1F2 DuoSet ELISA (DY201), mouse IL-1 beta/IL-1F2

ELISA (DY410) and DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit 2 (DY008) were purchased from R&D 
system.  
Immunofluorescence and live-video imaging 
For  immunofluorescence,  cells  plated  on  coverslips  (12-mm)  were  fixed  with  4% 
paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature after treatments. Coverslips were washed three 
times with PBS for 5 min each time and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min, 
followed by blocking in PBST (PBS plus 0.05% Tween-20) containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h. The 
coverslips were further incubated with anti-ASC antibody (1/100 dilution) for 1 h at room 
temperature, followed by incubation with the secondary for 1h at room temperature (avoid the 
coverslips in direct light). After three times washing with PBST, cells were stained with DAPI and 
mounted for further imaging. For live-video imaging, THP-1 WT and PIEZO1/2 dKO cells stably 
expressing jGCaMP7S were seeded on µ-dish 35 mm high glass bottom (81158, Ibidi) in culture 
medium  containing  100  nM  PMA  for  3 h,  followed  by  replacement  of  fresh  medium  and 
incubation overnight. On the next day, cells were treated with R837, Yoda1 or R837 plus Yoda1. 
The images were acquired using a Nikon spinning disk with an interval of 20s. Ionomycin was 
added at ~16 min after treatment. Fluorescence intensities of individual cells over time were 
quantified with Image J. 
Lentivirus packaging and infection  
The 3rd generation lentiviral vector system with three packaging helper plasmids (pVSVG, pMDL 
and pREV) was used in this study. The lentivirus packaging was performed in HEK293t cells. 
HEK293t cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the user’s manual. THP-1 
cells (4.0 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plate) were infected in 1.5 mL lentivirus-contained culture

medium plus 1 mL fresh medium containing final concentration of 10 µg/mL polybrene. 48 hours 
after viral infection, cells were used for further experiments. 
Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout screen  
The Brunello human genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lentiviral library containing 76,441 
sgRNAs systemically targeting 19,114 genes on human genome was used in this study. Briefly, 
THP-1 cells stably expressing Cas9 protein were infected with the pooled Brunello lentivirus 
library at ROI of 0.2. After puromycin selection for 3 days, cells were further expanded. To ensure 
a representation of minimal 500 cells per sgRNA, at least 4.0×107 cells were used in each group. 
An adequate number of cells were primed with LPS in suspension for 3 hours and treated with 
vehicle (control group) or R837 plus Yoda1 (treated group). When pyroptotic cell death reached 
~85% in the treated group, R837 and Yoda1 were washed out and the survivals were expanded. 
When cell number reached 4.0 × 107 cells, these cells were repeatedly treated with R837 plus 
Yoda1 to reach reached ~85% of pyroptotic cell death. R837 and Yoda1 were washed out and the 
survivals were further expanded to reach 4.0 × 107 cells. Genomic DNA from both control- and 
treated groups was isolated using the phenol/chloroform extraction method. Fragments containing 
sgRNA were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR referring to the protocol from broad institute 
GPP  Web  Protal  (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/resources/protocols).  PCR 
fragments were cleaned up using NucleoSpin gel and PCR clean-up kit (740609.50, MACHEREY-
NAGEL) according to the users’ manual and subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS). 
Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer as 50 bp single end reads by the 
GenomEast platform, a member of the ’France Genomique’ consortium (ANR-10-INBS-0009). 
Image analysis and base calling were performed using RTA version 2.7.7 and bcl2fastq version 
2.20.0.422. Sequencing reads were trimmed, aligned and counted using PinAPL-Py and guide

RNAs (Brunello library). The Matching Threshold for bowtie2 alignment was defined as 35. Data 
were statistically analyzed using Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout 
(MAGeCK v0.5.9.3). The method ranks sgRNAs based on p-values calculated from the negative 
binomial model, and uses a modified robust ranking aggregation (RRA) algorithm to identify 
positively or negatively selected genes. Read counts were normalized by total number of reads. 
Enrichment testing of paired samples was performed using the test function in MAGeCK with --
paired option. Volcano plot was generated using ggplot package in R and significance was defined 
as FDR < 0.05. 
Statistical analysis 
Preliminary experiments were performed and sample size was determined based on generally 
accepted rules to test preliminary conclusions reaching statistical significance, where applicable. 
For FACS experiments, the percentage of Sytox green-positive and PI-positive cells was provided. 
For immunofluorescence experiments, a minimum of 150 cells were counted per condition, and 
the percentage containing ASC specks cells was calculated. Values are presented by “Mean +/-
SD”. Unless specified, statistical analyses were performed with the two tailed t-test using Prism 
(GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was indicated using the following symbols: * p < 
0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
