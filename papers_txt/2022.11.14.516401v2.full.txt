ABSTRACT 
 
BACKGROUND. Paediatric neuroblastoma and brain tumours account for a third of all childhood 
cancer-related mortality. High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite 
intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. 
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is neurotropic and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential 
therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma.  
METHODS. Here, we perform an extensive meta-analysis of ZIKV infection studies to identify 
molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We 
summarise the neuroblastoma cell lines and ZIKV strains utilised and re-evaluate the infection 
data to deduce the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating 
transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we show the 
involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection.  
RESULTS. We identify that most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines are highly susceptible to 
ZIKV infection and that the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain is the most promising candidate for 
neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded 
Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV is 
dependent on SREBP-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER 
Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV nonstructural 
protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid 
metabolism and mammalian translocon.  
CONCLUSIONS. Our work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in 
neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy 
through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.

KEYPOINTS 
 
•  The Zika virus may provide the basis for an oncolytic virotherapy against Neuroblastoma 
•  Most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines are susceptible to Zika viral infection 
•  We identified molecular mechanisms that may induce the oncolytic response in 
Neuroblastoma 
 
Contribution to the field 
The ability to both induce direct oncolysis and provoke an anti-tumoral immune response makes 
oncolytic virotherapy an attractive candidate to combat aggressive and heterogenous cancers, 
such as high-risk neuroblastoma. To progress oncolytic virotherapy to clinical trial it is essential to 
understand the host mechanisms the virus manipulates to kill cancer cells, alongside any 
pathology as a consequence of infection of normal cells. Here, we show that ZIKV efficiently 
infects and induces oncolysis of paediatric neuroblastoma cells and propose a potential TNF 
pathway-driven immune response. ZIKV’s specificity for infection of nervous system cancer cells, 
while rarely causing nervous system-related pathology in young children, addresses many of its 
safety concerns. The inclusion of more effective and less toxic novel therapies, such as a potential 
ZIKV-based therapeutic, in multimodal treatment regimens will pave the way for improving patient 
long-term health and overall survival.

INTRODUCTION 
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid cancer in children, accounting for 6-10% of 
all paediatric cancers and disproportionately causing 12-15% of paediatric cancer-related deaths 
(1). It is an embryonal tumour originating from transformed cells of neural crest lineage and 
predominately forms tumours in the adrenal medulla and paraspinal sympathetic ganglia. Whilst 
the majority of patients are diagnosed by the age of 5 years, the median age of patients is 18 
months. Prognosis is highly heterogenous and can be predicted by a number of factors including 
presence of metastatic disease, age, chromosomal aberrations and molecular signatures such as 
MYC-N amplification (2). Patients are categorised according to internationally agreed risk groups 
(INRG), and treatment is stratified accordingly.  
Outcome for low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma is good, with some patients requiring little 
or no treatment. However, approximately 50% of patients have high-risk disease, for which 
prognosis is poor, with overall survival of less than 60% (3). Current high-risk neuroblastoma 
treatment regimens are aggressive. These include multiple rounds of induction chemotherapy, 
surgical resection, myeloablative chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation and post-
consolidation therapy such as immunotherapy (4). The aggressive nature of this regimen carries 
significant treatment-related mortality and frequently results in long-term toxicities and sequelae 
impacting the quality of life for surviving patients. Consequently, there is a clear and unmet need 
for safer and less toxic treatment regimens to combat high-risk neuroblastoma. 
Oncolytic virotherapy exploits viruses that preferentially infect and destroy cancer cells via two 
distinct routes of therapeutic action. Following infection, intense viral replication induces oncolysis, 
releasing virions into the tumour microenvironment to infect neighbouring tumour cells. Induction 
of a tumour-specific immune response is a crucial secondary mechanism employed by oncolytic 
virotherapy that can address highly heterogeneous tumours such as high-risk neuroblastoma and 
CNS tumours. There is significant interest in combining immuno-modulating cancer therapies with 
oncolytic virotherapy to augment the anti-tumoral immune response. Oncolytic virotherapy clinical

studies have in general reported low toxicity and minimal adverse effects in patients, mainly low-
grade constitutional symptoms (5).  
ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus consisting of historical African and epidemic-associated Asian 
lineages. The latter is neurotropic and can cause microcephaly in the developing fetus through 
infection of neural stem and progenitor cells, causing cell death and growth reduction (6,7). In 
contrast, ZIKV rarely causes adverse effects in children and adults, with the majority of cases (50-
80%) being asymptomatic (8). In symptomatic children, ZIKV may cause short-term side effects, 
namely rash, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, and in rare instances in adults can cause more 
severe conditions, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, meningitis and encephalitis (8,9). 
Since 2017, the concept of employing the ZIKV as oncolytic virotherapy against brain tumours has 
gained momentum. ZIKV induces an oncolytic event in infected paediatric brain tumour cells in 
vitro and in vivo assays and induces an immune response against spontaneous canine brain 
tumours (10–12). Paediatric neuroblastoma, like paediatric brain tumours, are predominantly 
tumours of the nervous system consisting of cancerous cells with neural characteristics. An initial 
study assessing ZIKV infection in multiple neuroblastoma cell lines demonstrated ZIKV’s potential 
as a novel neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy (13). Here, we survey over 35 studies that have 
used neuroblastoma cell lines to model ZIKV infection. These studies focused on understanding 
ZIKV pathology and assessing anti-viral compounds. Through re-analysis and integration of the 
transcriptomics, proteomics and dependency factor screens from these studies, we identify 
multiple molecular mechanisms implicated in ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma and aim to 
determine its potential as oncolytic virotherapy.

METHODS 
RNA-Seq data processing 
RNA-Seq data files (.fastq.gz paired-end) of ZIKV-infected paediatric neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y 
cells were acquired from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession: PRJNA630088). Our 
RNA-Seq processing pipeline consisted of FastQC (V0.11.9-0), Trim Galore (V0.6.6-0), HISAT2 
(V2.2.0), Samtools (V1.11) and Subread (V2.0.1). Reads were aligned against the Homo sapiens 
GRCh38 genome. 
Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis 
Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DeSeq2 to compare the triplicate of 
ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells versus the triplicate of non-infected SH-SY5Y control cells. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were plotted on bar charts, volcano and scatter plots using 
GraphPad PRISM (9.2.0). DEGs (padj < 0.05, fold change > 1.5) were submitted to DAVID as 
official gene symbols for Gene Ontology (Biological Process Direct), KEGG and Reactome 
pathway analysis. ZIKV-induced DEGs were mapped onto KEGG pathways using Pathview. ZIKV 
NS4B host interaction partners were also submitted to DAVID to identify the interaction between 
NS4B and host pathways. Significance values of DEG and pathway analysis were corrected for 
multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method (padj < 0.05).  
Interactome and ZIKV Dependency Factor analysis 
The ZIKV NS4B interactome in SK-N-BE(2) paediatric neuroblastoma cells were sourced from 
IMEx (IM-26452) and mapped in Cytoscape (3.9.1). 130 host NS4B interaction partners were 
submitted to STRING for high confidence (0.7) evidence-based physical subnetwork analysis, 
followed by integration with the NS4B interactome to identify the interaction of NS4B with host 
protein complexes. Additional data incorporated into the Cytoscape map includes known ZIKV 
dependency factors and the interaction of ZIKV NS2B-3 with the Mammalian Translocon. ZIKV 
dependency factors were sourced for paediatric SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma (14), GSC (15), 
hiPSC-NPC (16), HEK293FT (15) and HeLa cells (17).

RESULTS 
ZIKV displays strong oncolytic properties against neuroblastoma 
cells 
ZIKV infects and significantly reduces the cell viability of a multitude of neuroblastoma cell lines 
from both primary tumour and metastatic sites (Table 1). ZIKV can significantly reduce 
neuroblastoma cell viability using MOI as low as 0.001 (18). The cell viability of 10/15 
neuroblastoma cell lines is significantly reduced to below 20% following ZIKV infection and these 
observations are apparent despite the differences in the cell line, ZIKV strain, viral MOI and the 
type of assay performed (Table 1). SK-N-Be(1) and SK-N-Be(2) cells are from bone marrow 
metastasis from the same patient before and after treatment, respectively, and are both highly 
susceptible to ZIKV. Thus, Table 1 identifies that ZIKV can target neuroblastoma cells which 
originate from the primary tumour, metastatic sites and metastatic sites which are resistant to 
standard neuroblastoma therapy. SK-N-AS, T-268 and JFEN are highly resistant (cell viability 
>80%) to ZIKV infection. Susceptibility is independent of patient sex, cell line origin, morphology 
and MYC-N status (Table 1). The non-sympathetic nervous system and non-paediatric origin of 
the T-268 and JFEN cells likely explain their resistance to ZIKV infection, as ZIKV has a tropism 
for paediatric nervous system cancer cells. The resistance of the paediatric SK-N-AS cell line is 
governed by CD24 expression, which regulates the basal antiviral state of these cells (13,19). In 
conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that ZIKV is a strong candidate to employ against 
paediatric neuroblastoma as oncolytic virotherapy.  
ZIKV strains possess different therapeutic potential against 
neuroblastoma cells 
The neurotropism of the Asian lineage makes it the clear choice, over the African lineage, for 
developing ZIKV oncolytic virotherapy against brain tumours. However, the situation for 
Neuroblastoma is not so apparent. Independent studies have demonstrated inherent differences in 
the ability of varying ZIKV strains to infect, replicate, and kill neuroblastoma cells (20,21). Here, we 
assess all published data concerning ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma cells and ranked the viral 
strains based on their ability to infect neuroblastoma cells, produce fresh viral progeny and reduce

cell viability (Table 2). We identify the PRVABC59 Asian, Uganda #976 African and MR766 African 
strains as the top three candidates (Table 2). Interestingly, the PRVABC59 Asian strain induces 
significantly more DEGs and splice events in SH-SY5Y cells compared to the African MR766 
strain; including more immune and inflammatory response genes (22). Brain metastases develop 
in 5-11% of neuroblastoma patients and are correlated with poor prognosis (23). The neurotropism 
of the Asian lineage may enhance the therapeutic potential of ZIKV by targeting these brain 
metastases. The multiple ZIKV pandemics identified that infection by an Asian strain is generally 
well accommodated by children, thus providing evidence for the safety of employing an Asian 
strain. Consequently, from those tested to date, we identify that the PRVABC59 strain 
demonstrates the greatest promise for development as oncolytic virotherapy against paediatric 
neuroblastoma.  
ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma cells induces changes at the 
transcriptome level 
Differential gene expression analysis identifies 453 and 256 significantly upregulated and 
downregulated genes (fold change > 1.5), respectively, in ZIKV-infected paediatric neuroblastoma 
SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 1A). Gene Ontology (GO), Reactome and KEGG pathway analysis 
identifies nine significantly upregulated and 12 significantly downregulated terms (Figure 1B-C). 
Upregulated processes include “TNF signalling”, lipid metabolism (“Cholesterol biosynthesis”, 
“Cholesterol biosynthetic process”, “Activation of gene expression by SREBF (SREBP)”), ER 
stress (“Response to endoplasmic reticulum stress”, “XBP1(S) activates chaperone genes”) and 
transcription (“BMAL1:CLOCK, NPAS2 activates circadian gene expression”, “Positive regulation 
of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter”). The downregulated terms are predominantly 
cell cycle- and DNA replication-related processes and this downregulation is apparent when the 
“Cell Cycle” KEGG pathway is plotted for all DEGs (fold change > 0) (Figure 1D). A potential 
explanation for this observation is that ZIKV can disrupt the cell cycle by targeting the centrioles in 
neuroblastoma cells (24).

ZIKV induces TNF Signalling in neuroblastoma cells 
Of the top ten upregulated DEGs in SH-SY5Y cells, four (BIRC3, TNFAIP3, ICAM1 and BCL3) are 
components of the TNF signalling pathway (Figure 1A). The TNF pathway is particularly 
interesting to consider for oncolytic virotherapy since it may play a role in both oncolysis (direct cell 
death) and the anti-tumoral immune response. Here, mapping the “TNF Signalling” KEGG 
pathway for ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cannot deduce if ZIKV may activate CASP-mediated 
apoptosis or CASP-independent necroptosis (Figure 2A). However, ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells 
β
clearly show significant upregulation of transcription factors (AP-1, cEBP  and CREB), leukocyte 
recruitment and activation (CCL2 and CSF1), intracellular signalling (BCL3, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 
and TRAF1) and cell adhesion genes (Icam1 and Vcam1) (Figure 2A). ZIKV significantly 
upregulates the expression of multiple Activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors, including 
members from all four AP-1 subfamilies (ATF, JUN, FOS and MAF) in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 2B). 
AP-1 can regulate the expression of a diverse set of genes in response to nutrients, cytokines, 
stress or pathogen infection, and is involved in innate and adaptive immunity, differentiation, 
proliferation, survival and apoptosis (25). AP-1 increases the range of genes that it can regulate 
κ
‐
through interaction with additional factors, including NF B. NFKB1 and NFKB2 are both 
significantly upregulated by ZIKV infection (data not shown). AP-1 transcription factors can 
regulate the immune response of tumours, and significant AP-1 upregulation by ZIKV infection 
potentially identifies AP-1 as a mechanism through which ZIKV could yield an anti-tumoral immune 
response against neuroblastoma in vivo (26).  
Here, we identify CCL2 (MCP-1) to be significantly upregulated by ZIKV infection, and two 
independent studies have shown CCL2 to be secreted by ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells (27,28). 
CCL2 is a pro-inflammatory mediator that recruits leukocytes via chemotaxis to infiltrate tissues, 
including the CNS, to stimulate inflammation (29). A non-neurotoxic HSV-based oncolytic 
virotherapy, engineered to express physiologically relevant levels of CCL2 (M010), significantly 
reduced Neuro-2a neuroblastoma growth in the flank of immune-competent mice and recruited 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to infiltrate the tumour (29). Additionally, CCL2 is secreted by ZIKV-

infected cultured canine glioblastoma cells when in the presence of monocytes and is detected in 
serum and CSF samples of canines bearing spontaneous brain tumours following ZIKV infection 
(12). We propose here that CCL2 may be capable of inducing an anti-tumoral immune response 
against paediatric neuroblastoma during ZIKV infection. Supporting the notion of a ZIKV-induced 
inflammatory response, 32 genes implicated in cytokine signalling in the immune system are 
significantly differentially expressed in ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells: 27 upregulated and 5 
downregulated (Figure 2C).  
ZIKV induces lipid metabolism in neuroblastoma cells 
ZIKV infection significantly upregulates lipid metabolism-related terms in SH-SY5Y cells; 
specifically “Cholesterol biosynthesis” and “Activation of gene expression by SREBF (SREBP)” 
(Figure 1B). Cholesterol and lipids are essential cellular components and there are complex 
systems that function to regulate their intracellular abundance and localisation. These systems 
include regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by the SREBP pathway, intracellular cholesterol 
trafficking, and cholesterol efflux by the LXR pathway. Cholesterol and fatty acids are required for 
multiple stages of the flaviviral life cycle, including regulating viral entry, the formation of viral 
replication complexes in the ER membrane and viral egress (30). ZIKV elevates lipogenesis and 
remodels the composition of the lipid classes in infected SK-N-SH cells (31). Here, we identify 
several approaches to regulate ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma cells through modification of 
intracellular lipid levels (Table 3). These include supplementation with pathway regulators (PF-
429242, Fenofibrate, Lovastatin, U18666A and LXR 623) or exogenous lipids (Oleic acid, DHA 
and Cholesterol).  
The SREBP pathway is a principal regulator of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. The 
SREBF1 and SREBF2 transcription factors control this pathway, and although they share a small 
degree of redundancy, they primarily regulate the expression of fatty acid biosynthesis and 
cholesterol biosynthesis target genes, respectively (32). Both SREBF2 and SREBF2-AS1 are 
significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 3A) and pathway analysis 
identifies significant upregulation of “Cholesterol biosynthesis”. Three SREBP pathway inhibitors

(PF-429242, Fenofibrate and Lovastatin) reduce the capability of ZIKV to infect SK-N-SH 
neuroblastoma cells (Table 3). We identify here that the SREBP pathway is essential for ZIKV 
infection and propose that it may upregulate cholesterol biosynthesis through the SREBF2 
transcriptional pathway in neuroblastoma cells. 
Both U18666A and exogenous cholesterol restricts ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma cells (Table 
3). U18666A is an intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor that causes the accumulation of 
cholesterol in lysosomes to hinder the endosomal-lysosomal system (33). Exogenous cholesterol 
also leads to the inactivation of the late endosomal-lysosomal compartments through a build-up of 
cholesterol (33). Collectively, this identifies a dependence of the ZIKV life cycle in neuroblastoma 
cells on intracellular cholesterol for the correct functioning of the endosomal-lysosomal system. 
The Liver X receptor (LXR) pathway agonist (LXR 623) promotes cholesterol efflux (Table 3). 
Flaviviruses require cholesterol for the restructuring of host membranes, and LXR 623 
demonstrates this dependence of ZIKV in neuroblastoma by preventing ZIKV-induced vesicle 
production and ER expansion in SK-N-SH cells (34). The LXR pathway and expression of its 
α
downstream lipid homeostasis genes are regulated by the transcription factors LXR-  (NR1H3) 
β α
and LXR-  (NR1H2). LXR-  protein is significantly increased by ZIKV infection of SK-N-SH 
α
neuroblastoma cells from 48hr (34). Although LXR-  mRNA is only marginally upregulated in our 
study, two major cholesterol efflux factors that are downstream of the LXR pathway, ATP-Binding 
Cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1), are significantly upregulated (Figure 3B). This 
identifies a dependence of ZIKV on the LXR pathway and suggests that ZIKV may manipulate this 
pathway in neuroblastoma cells to upregulate cholesterol efflux. 
We identify here that lipid abundance, localisation, trafficking and metabolism regulate ZIKV 
infection of neuroblastoma cells and that ZIKV likely remodels the cellular lipid composition to help 
produce a favourable environment for efficient replication.

ZIKV induces and is dependent on the ER stress response in 
neuroblastoma cells 
ZIKV upregulates ER-stress-related terms in SH-SY5Y cells, principally “Response to endoplasmic 
reticulum stress” and “XBP1(S) activates chaperone genes” (Figure 1B). The Unfolded Protein 
Response (UPR) dictates the ER-stress response. The UPR is normally inactive due to the ER 
chaperone BIP sequestering three ER stress sensors (IRE1, PERK and ATF6). Under stress 
conditions BIP releases IRE1, PERK and ATF6 to assist protein folding, allowing them to activate 
their respective UPR-mediated ER-stress pathways.  
Activation of the IRE1-mediated UPR leads to IRE1 splicing a 26bp region from the ubiquitously 
expressed XBP1 mRNA. The active transcription factor XBP1(S) then drives the expression of 
genes to help alleviate ER stress, primarily chaperone and ER-associated protein degradation 
(ERAD) genes. ZIKV infection significantly upregulates 15 genes of the IRE1-mediated “XBP1(S) 
activates chaperone genes” Reactome pathway in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 4A). XBP1 is the most 
highly upregulated gene and others include the ERAD gene SYVN1 and the chaperones DNAJC3 
and DNAJB9 (Figure 4A). Multiple IRE1-mediated UPR genes (EDEM1, SYVN1, SSR1, SRPRB, 
ATP6V0D1, and EXTL3) are ZIKV dependency factors in hiPSC-NPCs (Supplementary data). 
μ
Chemical inhibition of IRE1 by 4 8C impairs ZIKV infection in vivo (35). Here, we identify that 
ZIKV significantly upregulates the IRE1-mediated UPR in SH-SY5Y cells and that ZIKV is 
dependent on this for efficient infection, likely as a means to regulate and combat viral replication-
induced ER stress.  
PERK-mediated UPR regulates the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, redox, amino acid 
transport and autophagy through eIF2 phosphorylation and the transcription factor ATF4. ZIKV 
infection significantly upregulates seven genes of the Reactome pathway "ATF4 activates genes in 
response to endoplasmic reticulum stress" (Figure 4B), including the ERAD gene HERPUD1 and 
the transcription factors ATF3, CEBPB and CEBPG. GADD34 (PPP1R15A) which usually 
α
dephosphorylates eIF2  in a negative feedback loop, is significantly upregulated here by ZIKV 
infection, and ZIKV induces eIF2 phosphorylation in SK-N-SH cells (36). ZIKV likely upregulates

GADD34 to combat ER stress-induced translational repression, as fresh virions require de novo 
protein synthesis. CHOP (DDIT3) is a pro-apoptotic protein downstream of the PERK UPR 
pathway that others have observed to be significantly upregulated in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells 
in response to ZIKV infection (36–38). CHOP induces apoptotic markers, including Caspase 3, 
leading to cell death. Interestingly, multiple PERK-mediated UPR genes (ATF4, EIF2AK1, 
EIF2AK2, EIF2AK3 and EIF2AK4) are ZIKV dependency factors in hiPSC-NPCs (Supplementary 
data).  
We conclude that ZIKV specifically upregulates and is dependent on the IRE1 and PERK 
branches, but not the ATF6 branch, of the UPR ER stress response in SH-SY5Y cells; conclusions 
that are supported by others (36,37). 
ZIKV is dependent on the EMC in neuroblastoma cells 
To determine what host mechanisms ZIKV may be dependent on, we cross-referenced the 22 
known proteins which ZIKV requires to infect neuroblastoma cells with ZIKV dependency factors 
from four cell lines (Figure 5A, Supplementary data). Between 72-94% of the dependency factors 
identified across the five different cell lines are cell-specific, highlighting how ZIKV utilises differing 
host factors across different cell types for its life cycle. The sparse overlap of ZIKV dependency 
factors identifies only one factor common to all five cell types. MMGT1 (EMC5) is a key 
component of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Membrane Protein Complex (EMC). The EMC is a 
hetero-oligomer composed of ten subunits, has chaperone properties by assisting multi-
transmembrane protein folding, and is implicated in ER stress, flavivirus infection and lipid 
trafficking (39). To assess if ZIKV is dependent on additional EMC subunits during infection, we 
searched for them in our ZIKV dependency factor dataset. We identify that ZIKV has a strong 
dependence on the EMC independent of cell type; all ten EMC proteins are ZIKV-dependency 
factors in hiPSC-NPC, eight are in HeLa and three in GSC and HEK293FT cells (Figure 5B). The 
EMC facilitates the expression of ZIKV transmembrane proteins (NS2B, NS4A and NS4B), ZIKV 
NS4B interacts with EMC subunits, and disrupting the EMC impedes infection by ZIKV and other 
flaviviruses (40,41). We propose that the EMC stabilises ZIKV proteins through integration into the

ER membrane, thus permitting efficient infection in neuroblastoma cells. If investigated, we predict 
that additional EMC subunits would present as ZIKV dependency factors in neuroblastoma cells. 
ZIKV is dependent on the V-ATPase in neuroblastoma cells 
Acidification of the endosomal-lysosomal system by the V-ATPase is a property which viruses can 
utilise to drive the release of their nucleocapsid into the cytosol. ATP6V0C, a central component of 
the V-ATPase, is a ZIKV-dependency factor in neuroblastoma, hiPSC-NPC and HEK293FT cells 
(Figure 5A). Twelve additional V-ATPase subunits are ZIKV dependency factors across GSC, 
hiPSC-NPC and HeLa cells (Figure 5C). These 13 genes consist of multiple subunits from the Vo 
proton translocation and V1 ATP hydrolytic domains, identifying a functional dependence of ZIKV 
on the entire V-ATPase complex. The V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 specifically binds 
ATP6V0C and through V-ATPase inhibition prevents lysosomal acidification and the autophagy-
lysosome pathway (42). Bafilomycin A1 inhibits ZIKV infection of SH-SY5Y cells, supporting our 
observation (Table 3). siRNA silencing of the V-ATPase significantly impairs ZIKV infection of 
T98G glioblastoma cells, collaborating its requirement for infection of nervous system tumour cells 
(43). We propose that loss of V-ATPase function impairs ZIKV infection in SH-SY5Y cells due to a 
perturbed pH gradient in the endosomal system. This likely prevents fusion of the viral envelope 
with the endosomal membrane for release of the nucleocapsid, therefore, trapping ZIKV for 
degradation in the lysosome, as observed in Vero cells (44).  
ZIKV NS4B possesses oncolytic capability against neuroblastoma 
cells 
ZIKV NS4B protein is principally responsible for the oncolytic effect in SH-SY5Y cells, via 
activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (45). Determining the interactions and mechanisms 
underpinning this may yield opportunities to develop a paediatric neuroblastoma therapy based on 
ZIKV NS4B. ZIKV NS4B has 130 known host interaction partners in SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma 
cells (14). Here, we analyse this interactome and identify multiple pathways which we, and others, 
have implicated during ZIKV infection of neuroblastoma cells: including mitochondrial-, lipid 
metabolism- and ER-associated processes (Figure 6). ZIKV NS4B interacts with ten lipid

biosynthesis proteins, three (SCD, SC5D and DHCR7) of which are expressed in response to 
SREBP pathway activation. This identifies a direct interaction between ZIKV and host lipid 
metabolism and the SREBP pathway, supporting our previous observations at the transcriptome 
level. 
ZIKV NS4B recruits BAX to the mitochondria, triggers its activation, and releases Cytochrome c 
from mitochondria to induce mitochondrial cell death in SH-SY5Y cells (45). ZIKV NS4B interacts 
with a multitude of mitochondrial genes (Figure 6). Including, electron transport chain proteins 
(TIMMDC1, MT-CO2, COX15 and OXA1L), mitochondrial translocases that import proteins into 
the mitochondrial matrix (TOMM22, TIMM23, TIMM50 and TIMM17B) and Solute Carrier Family 
25 members for transport of solutes across the mitochondrial membrane (SLC25A1, SLC25A3, 
SLC25A6, SLC25A11, SLC25A12, SLC25A13 and SLC25A22). Specifically, MT-CO2, COX15 and 
OXA1L are conserved catalytic core, assembly and accessory subunits of the Cytochrome c 
oxidase complex, respectively. The Cytochrome c oxidase complex tightly couples Cytochrome c 
to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We propose that NS4B interacts with Cytochrome c oxidase 
to uncouple it from Cytochrome c, causing Cytochrome c release through the BAX pore into the 
cytosol to drive the mitochondrial cell death pathway in neuroblastoma cells. 
ZIKV NS4B interacts with the Mammalian Translocon in 
neuroblastoma cells 
ZIKV NS4B interacts with and is dependent on multiple proteins of the Mammalian Translocon 
(Figures 5A & 6). The mammalian translocon is primarily composed of the Oligosaccharyl 
Transferase (OST) complex, the Sec61 complex and the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) 
complex (46). The multimeric OST complex co-translationally N-glycosylates proteins within the 
α
ER to assist protein folding, stability and trafficking. The Sec61 complex, a heterotrimer of Sec61 , 
β γ
Sec61  and Sec61 , co-translationally translocates newly synthesised proteins across the ER and 
α
during ER stress can regulate IRE1  activity. TRAP is a heterotetramer of SSR1, SSR2, SSR3 
and SSR4 that assists co-translational translocation of proteins into the ER and can prevent 
aberrant N-linked glycosylation during ER stress.

STT3A, a principal component of the OST complex, interacts with ZIKV NS4B and is a ZIKV 
dependency factor in neuroblastoma, GSC, hiPSC-NPC and HeLa cells (Figures 5A & 6). 
Regarding the additional OST subunits, ZIKV NS4B interacts with DDOST, RPN1, RPN2 and 
KRTCAP2, and OSTC and OST4 are ZIKV dependency factors in HeLa cells and GSCs, 
respectively (Figures 5A & 6). Two forms of the OST complex exist, the STT3A and STT3B OST 
paralogs. KRTCAP2 and OSTC are STT3A-specific OST factors, which permit interaction of 
STT3A with the translocon, whilst TUSC3 and MAGT1 are STT3B-specific OST factors (46). 
STT3A and both STT3A-specific OST factors are ZIKV interaction partners and/or dependency 
factors, but neither STT3B nor the STT3B-specific OST factors are. In addition to the OST factors, 
multiple N-linked glycosylation-related proteins (DPM1, DERL3, SYVN1, UBE2G2 and UBE2J1) 
are also ZIKV dependency factors in non-neuroblastoma cells (Supplementary data). The OST 
complex inhibitor NGI-1 blocks ZIKV infection of Huh7 cells, and disrupting ZIKV prM and E 
protein N-glycosylation impairs the release of infectious ZIKV particles from Vero cells (47,48). 
Here, we identify that STT3A functions as a bonafide ZIKV dependency factor in multiple cell 
types, and conclude that efficient infection of neuroblastoma cells by ZIKV is likely dependent on 
the STT3A OST paralog for N-glycosylation of its viral proteins. 
ZIKV NS4B interacts with SEC61A1 and SEC61B of the Sec61 complex in neuroblastoma cells 
α
and the Sec61  inhibitor Mycolactone impedes ZIKV infection of HeLa cells (49). ZIKV NS4B 
interacts with SSR3 of the TRAP complex in neuroblastoma cells and ZIKV is dependent on at 
least two of the four TRAP complex subunits for infection of GSC, hiPSC-NPC and HeLa cells 
(Figure 5A). Further supporting our observation of ZIKV interacting and being dependent on the 
mammalian translocon is its dependence on SRPRB, SPCS3 and TRAM1; subunits of the Signal 
Recognition Particle (SRP), the Signal Peptidase Complex (SPCS) and the Translocating chain-
associated membrane protein (TRAM), respectively. Interestingly, the viral protease NS2B-3 also 
interacts with subunits of the OST complex (STT3A, RPN1), Sec61 complex (SEC61B) and TRAP 
complex (SSR3) (Figure 6). These interactions likely facilitate the co-translational cleavage of the 
viral polypeptide by NS2B-3 into its individual viral proteins.

Here, we identify that ZIKV NS4B and NS2B-3 directly interact with the core complexes of the 
mammalian translocon, and propose that these interactions are essential for the ZIKV life cycle in 
neuroblastoma cells. The dependency of ZIKV likely stems from the mammalian translocon 
facilitating viral polyprotein co-translational translocation, viral polyprotein cleavage, viral 
membrane protein insertion and/or viral protein N-glycosylation. Additionally, ZIKV may utilise its 
protein interactions with the Sec61 complex, TMEM33 and VAPB, to regulate the IRE1- and 
PERK-mediated UPR ER stress responses, that we identify to be significantly upregulated at the 
transcriptome level in ZIKV infected-neuroblastoma cells.

SUMMARY 
Our meta-analysis highlights the strong therapeutic potential of ZIKV, specifically the PRVABC59 
strain, against multiple neuroblastoma cell-lines. We identify ZIKV to interact with, and be 
dependent on, multiple host protein complexes and pathways for its life cycle in paediatric 
neuroblastoma cells and for inducing oncolysis (Figure 7). Although this area of research is still at 
an early stage, our extensive survey of neuroblastoma ZIKV infection studies clearly demonstrates 
the potential of a ZIKV-based therapeutic. There are a few avenues which need to be addressed 
to progress this area of research, including; (1) assessing ZIKV’s oncolytic effect against 
neuroblastoma in xenograft mouse models, (2) assessing ZIKV’s capability to induce an anti-
tumoral immune response against neuroblastoma in immune-competent in vivo models, and (3) 
considering the effectiveness and safety of employing different forms of ZIKV-based therapeutics 
against neuroblastoma. Examples of the latter may include live attenuated ZIKV strains or the 
construction of a virotherapy that collectively expresses ZIKV NS4B and CCL2, which we show 
here to hold elements of ZIKV’s oncolytic and immune activatory potential, respectively.

 Table 2. ZIKV strains possess differing therapeutic potential against neuroblastoma cells. ZIKV 
strains are ranked by their ability to infect, replicate within and significantly reduce the cell 
viability of a multitude of neuroblastoma cells. Data accordance denotes the degree of similarity 
of the results between publications which performed cell viability of cell death assays in 
neuroblastoma cells using the same ZIKV strain. Data accordance of 5 denotes that the findings 
of one publication closely support the findings from another, a data accordance of 1 denotes 
publications reporting vastly contrasting results. When a viral strain is published in only one 
paper, it is allocated a data accordance of NA.

Figure 6. The ZIKV NS4B interactome in neuroblastoma cells and its interaction with ZIKV 
dependency factors. Nodes are grouped and labelled according to any sets of high-confidence 
interactions between the host proteins, and by pathways they are involved in. Cross-referencing 
the interactome with the ZIKV dependency factor datasets identifies the interaction of NS4B with 
dependency factors in neuroblastoma cells (red) and in GSC, hiPSC-NPC, HeLa and HEK293FT 
cells (collectively termed non-neuroblastoma cells, orange). To aid visualisation, any nodes 
possessing no high confidence interactions, other than their interaction with NS4B, have been 
grouped. All nodes within Figure 6 interact with NS4B, thus, to aid visualisation all edges between 
NS4B and nodes within a group have been condensed into a single edge between NS4B and the 
grouped set of nodes.
