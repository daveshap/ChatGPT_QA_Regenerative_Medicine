B3 which was not statistically significant (p = 0.058). When ROC analysis was 
performed, 95% CI p = 0.035 for B3 (0.517 - 0.792) was found. In patients

terms of anemia (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Erythrocyte membrane protein B3 
is not only useful in predicting the patient under the risk of developing ane-
mia, but also it may be useful in preventing it and it may explain why women 
inclined to anemia.

1. Introduction 
The current standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is pegin-
terferon and ribavirin, which can induce a sustained virological response (SVR) 
in the majority of patients treated [1] [2]. 
Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue [3]. Even though its mechanism of 
action is still controversial, it widely prevents the replication of DNA and RNA 
viruses through the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an es-
sential enzyme in the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate [3]. The final step of 
this chain is the fatal mutagenesis of the RNA genome [3]. Currently, the treat-
ment of patients with hepatitis C consists of interferon-α and ribavirin combina-
tion therapy [4] [5]. Combination therapy, in comparison to single-agent inter-
feron treatment, leads to an increase in side effects [4]-[11]. Dose reductions are 
common and they are essentially required in 10% of patients under combination 
therapy who develop anemia [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]. The major toxicity related to ri-
bavirin use is haemolytic anemia. This side effect has been associated with the 
accumulation of ribavirin triphosphate in red blood cells (RBCs), leading to the 
inhibition of erythrocyte functions [12] [13]. 
The single most common adverse event and the primary reason for dose mod-
ifying ribavirin is haemolytic anemia [1] [2] [14] [15]. The median declines in 
haemoglobin during the course of the treatment with PEGIFN and RVN is 2.5 g 
[1] [2] [14] [15]. Approximately 20% of patients have a decline in haemoglobin 
of 4 g or more [16]. 
Aim of this study is to investigate whether erythrocyte membrane proteins 
(EMP) predict interferon ribavirin-induced anemia. 
2. Methods 
Patient Selection: A total of 50 consecutive prospectively enrolled patients 
with chronic HCV infection who underwent liver biopsy at Mersin University 
Faculty of Medicine Hospital comprised the study cohort between January 
2007-December 2008. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics 
Committee of our hospitals and all subjects gave written informed consent to 
participate in the present study. All subjects had antibodies against HCV (Abbot, 
Axsym. Hepatitis C virus encoded antigen) and detectable HCV RNA by PCR 
(Amplicor HCV; Roche Diagnostics. Branchburg, NJ).  
A complete clinical evaluation was performed on each patient. Baseline cha-
racteristics collected at the time of liver biopsy included the age, height, weight 
and body mass index (BMI). The formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided 
by height in meters squared. Information regarding the average current daily al-

cohol intake (g/day) in the past 6 months and past alcohol intake (g/day) before 
the last 6 months was noted. The patients with diabetes mellitus, heart disease, 
renal failure, anemia and haemoglobinopathy were excluded. 
Laboratory Test: In the morning of the liver biopsy, venous blood was drawn 
after a 12 hour overnight fast to determine the serum levels of alanine amino-
transferase, albumin, bilirubin, complete blood count, international normalized 
ratio, and EMP content. On the 4 week, blood samples were collected in order to 
measure EMP content and ribavirin levels. The following laboratory values were 
measured at baseline, and then at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 48 of treat-
ment: haemoglobin, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, platelets and ALT. 
All biochemical tests were performed using a conventional automated analyzer 
within the Department of Clinical Chemistry at Mersin University Faculty of 
Medicine Hospital. 
The plasma level of ribavirin at therapy week 4 was measured by high pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
Erythrocyte Membrane Protein Extraction: The blood samples collected to 
determine the EMP were centrifuged for 20 min/1000g followed by the removal 
of the plasm − platelet + leukocyte layer on top. Equal amounts of isotonic 
phosphate (5 mM NaH2PO4 and 147 mM NaCl) tampon were placed on the 
underlying cells. It was again centrifuged for 20 min/1000g followed by the re-
moval of the liquid on top. The washing process was repeated three times. Each 
time, some portion of the upper-lying cells was removed to obtain a pure eryt-
hrocyte suspension. What were obtained in the end were light pink erythrocyte 
membrane proteins remnants, which were stored at −80˚C until EMP determi-
nation. 
To denature the proteins, 2 ml of electrophoresis pre-treatment solution (1% 
Sodium Dodecyle Sulphate, 7% Sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH: 8)) were added 
on the erythrocyte membrane protein remnants, and it was stored at 37˚C for 60 
minutes. 
The denatured samples were electrophoresed with SDS-PAGE. The protein 
fractions were stained by soaking in 1% of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 over-
night at room temperature. Fractions were obtained during the electrophoresis 
of the membrane proteins extracted from all blood samples collected from pa-
tients. These fractions were: Spectrin (Sp), Ankyrin (Ank), Protein Band 3 (B3), 
Protein Band 4.1 (B4.1), Protein Band 4.2 (B4.2). The quantitative evaluation of 
the fractions was made with a Densitometer (Beckman Appraise). 
Statistical Analysis: Once all data was entered into the MedCalc 9.4.2.1 
package programme, informative statistics for all parameters were given for both 
the group with anemia and the group without anemia. Cut-off values were de-
termined according to the values with anemia and without anemia, and also the 
statistics were calculated. Also the areas below the ROC curve were calculated as 
per the parameters, and they were compared with the areas which were below 
the ROC curve as per the other parameters, and the related graphics were drawn.

3. Results   
Characteristics of Patients 
180 mcg interferon α 2a once a week and weight adjusted ribavirin (Subjects 
with body weight < 65 kg: 800 mg/day, subjects with body weight < 85 kg > 65 
kg: 1000 mg/day, subjects with body weight > 85 kg: 1200 mg/day) daily were 
given for 48 weeks to fifty patients with chronic hepatitis C (See Table 1). The 
dose of ribavirin was reduced by 200 mg in patients whose haemoglobin con-
centrations fell below 10 g/dL during the course of treatment and it was discon-
tinued if the concentration of Hb fell below 8.5 g/dL. There were 25 female and 
25 male patients with a median age of 54.86 ± 8.00 years. The patients’ erythro-
cyte membrane protein levels were as follows: Sp: 20.468 ± 2.5902, Ank: 4.576 ± 
1.2706, B3: 19.240 ± 2.8358, B4.1: 5.628 ± 1.8832 and B4.2: 5.848 ± 1.8030. Ane-
mia developed in 17 patients (34%). 14 of these patients were of female and 3 
were of male gender; the gender played a significant role in terms of anemia (p = 
0.003). Erythrocyte membrane protein contents by gender were only different at 
B3 (p = 0.042) (See Table 2). Ribavirin treatment was discontinued in 9 (10.58%). 
With respect to anemia; the plasma levels of ribavirin was not different (1.384 ± 
0.644 mg/ml vs 1.276 ± 0.858 mg/ml; p = 0.390)  
When the relation between the development of anemia and erythrocyte 
membrane proteins was investigated, a relation was only found at B3, which was 
not statistically significant (p = 0.058). No statistically significant differences 
were observed in the areas below the curve when activities of EMPs’ in diagnos-
ing anemia were analyzed by pairwise comparison of ROC curve. The calculated 
p values are as follows: p = 0.210 for SP and B3, p = 0.467 for Sp and Ank, p =

When ROC analysis was performed, 95 % CI p = 0.035 for B3 (0.517 - 0.792) 
was found. In patients whose B3 level was below 17.7%, the sensitivity of anemia 
development risk was calculated as 64.7% and the specificity thereof was calcu-
lated as 66.7% (Figure 2(a) & Figure 2(b)). 
4. Discussion 
We have observed a relation between the development of anemia and B3 level. 
The result for B3 in ROC analysis was 95% CI (0517 - 0.792) p = 0.035. In pa-
tients whose B3 level was below 17.7%, the sensitivity of anemia development 
risk was calculated as 64.7% and the specificity thereof was calculated as 66.7%. 
We have observed more anemia cases on females (14/17, p = 0.003), the reason 
of which we have explained with lower levels of B3 compared to males (18.144 ± 
1.9197 versus 19.596 ± 2.9054. p = 0.042). 
The average maximum reduction in haemoglobin levels was 3.1 g/dL with ri-
bavirin plus conventional interferon, and 3.7 g/dL with ribavirin plus pegylated 
interferon [2] [17]. Ribavirin causes various degrees of erythrocyte haemolysis in 
nearly all patients, and necessitates a dose reduction in 7% - 9% of patients un-
der combination therapy [2] [3] [17] [18]. The prevalence of anemia in our 
study was 34% (17/50). The higher frequency compared to that reported in the 
literature may be attributable to our definition of anemia as haemoglobin levels 
below 10 g/dl. Ribavirin treatment was discontinued in 9 (10.58%); these results 
are consistent with those reported in the literature.  
Little is known about the mechanism of anemia developing during IFN/ribavirin 
combination therapy for HCV infection. Ribavirin causes dose-dependent and 
reversible haemolytic anemia. Once inside the red blood cells, ribavirin under-
goes phosphorylation to its active form that causes depletion of adenosine tri-
phosphate, and ribavirin triphosphate, which interrupts cellular functions, ac-
cumulates inside the erythrocytes [19] [20]. The accumulation of ribavirin tri-
phosphate inside the RBCs disrupts antioxidant mechanisms on the erythrocyte

membrane and causes oxidative damage, which leads to the removal of the 
damaged erythrocytes by the reticuloendothelial system [20]. When erythrocytes 
are exposed to in-vitro ribavirin, the osmotic fragility and deformability of red 
blood cells are maintained [21]. 
Homma et al. [22] established a significant correlation between the female 
gender, advanced age (>60 years) and weight-adjusted ribavirin dosage (>12 
mg/kg) and anemia. Erythrocyte ribavirin level was another risk factor that was 
reported [23]. The only factor that posed a risk for the development of anemia in 
another our study was age [24]. The risk of anemia increased 1.112-fold with 
age.  
Furthermore, in-vitro studies have shown that RBCs of patients who develop 
haemolytic anemia during HCV treatment are more susceptible to oxidative 
stress [25]. Marked differences have been ascertained in the oxidative stress 
markers and membrane proteins of patients with or without a history of ribavi-
rin-induced anemia [25]. These findings suggest that there exist risk factors re-
lated to erythrocytes for ribavirin-induced anemia. It has been suggested that the 
augmented susceptibility of erythrocytes to oxidative stress and modifications in 
the erythrocyte membrane content may be a result of alterations in the Adeno-
sylmethionine/Adenosylhomocysteine ratio inside erythrocytes that are caused 
by ribavirin; however this has not been investigated [26]. It has been shown that 
total cholesterol, total phospholipids and the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio dis-
tinctly increase in the erythrocyte membrane lipid contents in patients receiving 
IFN/ribavirin treatment [27]. It is particularly contended that these changes in 
the erythrocyte membrane lipids lead to a decrease in erythrocyte flexibility 
and membrane viscosity, and may result in the haemolytic anemia related to 
IFN/ribavirin treatment [27]. 
The red blood cell (RBC), an anucleated cell, presents a very limited biosyn-
thesis capacity and poor repair mechanisms. Thus, whenever exposed to physical 
and/or chemical stress. RBC suffers and accumulates physical and/or molecular 
damage. Several enzymes are involved in the RBC antioxidant defence, such as 
catalase (Cat), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 
which is a selenium (Se)-dependent enzyme. The levels of reduced glutathione 
(GSH) in the cell are also important in protecting the cell from the deleterious 
action of reactive oxygen species. The ageing of the cell is associated with a de-
crease in the activity of several enzymes (such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-
genase [28] [29] and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) [29] and with modifications 
in membrane proteins [30], which ultimately may lead to its destruction. Mod-
ifications in the erythrocyte membrane band 3 protein, by proteolytic cleavage, 
clustering or exposure of unusual epitopes, trigger the binding of specific an-
ti-band 3 autoantibodies and complement activation, marking the cell for death 
[31] [32] [33] [34]. Pronounced differences in markers of oxidative stress and 
membrane proteins exist between patients with and without a history of ribavi-
rin-induced anemia [25]. Patients with previous severe ribavirin-induced anemia 
had lower levels of protein sulfhydryls and thioredoxin, higher levels of pro-

tein-mixed disulfides and glutathione peroxidase, and a membrane protein pat-
tern consistent with band 4 dimer disaggregation [25]. In vitro studies have 
shown that erythrocytes of patients who have had haemolysis during treatment 
of HCV are more susceptible to oxidative stress [25].  
De Franceschi L et al. [15] have reported that ribavirin-treated patients showed 
an increase in aggregated band 3, which was associated with a significantly in-
creased binding of autologous antibodies and complement C3 fragments indi-
cating an erythrophagocytic removal by reticuloendothelial system. Older and 
damaged RBCs presented higher band 3 aggregation and lower fragmentation 
[28]. The younger RBCs showed reduced aggregation and higher fragmentation 
[28].  
Human pregnancy is associated with increased oxidative stress [35]. These 
features may account for some erythrocyte membrane damage in pregnancy [36] 
[37]. The data of study which investigated erythrocyte band 3 profile as a cumu-
lative marker of oxidative and/or proteolytic damage have suggested band 3 pro-
file as a marker of erythrocyte changes in pregnancy, which are independent of 
the “physiological anemia” of pregnancy [38].  
The development of cellular defects earlier during the RBC life-span leads to 
their premature removal from the circulation [31] [39] [40]. The pathway for the 
removal of senescent or damaged RBCs must involve a change in components 
that are already present in the circulating RBC, since de novo protein synthesis 
will have terminated before the RBC reaches maturity. In fact, a senescent cell 
antigen immunologically related to band 3 protein [32] [33] [41], the trans-
membrane protein known as the anion channel, marks the RBC for death by 
triggering the binding of a specific autoanti-band 3 antibody, and complement 
activation [31] [35] [39] [42]. The modified antigenicity of band 3 may result 
from proteolytic cleavage, clustering or even by exposure of unusual epitopes 
[39] [43] [44]. Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that any RBC under 
oxidative and/or proteolytic stress will be marked for death by band 3 modifica-
tion, and that the band 3 profile may provide a useful marker of biochemical 
distress. Changes in band 3 observed with aging include a decrease in efficiency 
in anion transport, in spite of an increase in the number of anion bindings sites, 
decrease in glucose transport, binding of antibodies to aged band 3, increase in 
band 3 degradation to smaller fragments, and in situ binding of physiological 
IgG autoantibodies resulting in cellular removal [45]. 
Band 3 isoforms. members of the anion exchange family of proteins, are in a 
number of physiological activities such as cell volume and osmotic haemostasis. 
HCO−/Cl− Exchange, red cell aging, IgG binding and cellular removal, and the 
3
maintenance of the structural integrity of cells [45]. The findings of previous 
studies have confirmed that band 3 is important in acid base haemostasis, O/CO 
2 2
transport, and membrane stability and skeletal organization [45]. Band 3 defi-
cient red cells were very unstable suggesting that the bilayer of the normal red 
cell membrane may be stabilized by interaction with band 3 [45].

Hence, deficiency in the level of B3 can be so extended that, remaining 
amount can be unable to preclude oxidative stress caused by ribavirin. Flexibility 
of erythrocyte membrane can diminish; transformation to senescent erythrocyte 
form can be accelareted and eventually moved off the circulation. Especially, a 
decrease in the RBC deformability and membrane fluidity by changes in these 
RBC membrane proteins was supposed and it is suggested that those changes 
may result in haemolytic anemia by interferon plus ribavirin treatment.  
As a result of this study, we showed that the level of erythrocyte membrane 
protein band 3 may predict ribavirin induced anemia. There are a lot of band 3 
mutations and polymorphisms [46]. Study of naturally occurring band 3 muta-
tions or measuring of the level of band 3 or band 3 profiles may help in the un-
derstanding or prediction of the interferon ribavirin induced anemia.
