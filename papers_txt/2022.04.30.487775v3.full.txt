66  Abstract  
67  Introduction: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) have been studied in various solid tumors but 
68  clinical utility of CTC in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) remains unclear. The aim of the 
69  CTC-CPC study was to develop an EpCAM-independent CTC isolation method allowing 
70  isolation of a broader range of living CTC from SCLC and decipher their genomic and 
71  biological characteristics. 
72  Patients and methods: CTC-CPC is a monocentric prospective non-interventional study 
73  including treatment-naïve newly diagnosed SCLC. CD56+CTC were isolated from whole 
74  blood samples, at diagnosis and relapse after first-line treatment and submitted to  Whole-
75  exome-sequencing (WES). 
76  Results: Phenotypic study confirms tumor lineage and tumorigenic properties of isolated cells 
77  for the 4 patients analyzed with WES. WES of CD56+CTC and matched tumor biopsy reveal 
78  genomic  alteration  frequently  impaired  in  SCLC.  At  diagnosis  CD56+CTC  were 
79  characterized by a high mutation load, a distinct mutational profile and a unique genomic, 
80  compared to match tumors biopsies. In addition to classical pathways altered in SCLC, we 
81  found  new  biological  processes  specifically  affected  in  CD56+CTC  at  diagnosis.  High 
82  numeration of CD56+CTC (>7/ml) at diagnosis was associated with ES-SCLC. Comparing 
83  CD56+CTC isolated at diagnosis and relapse, we identify differentially altered oncogenic 
84  pathways (e.g. DLL3 or MAPK pathway).  
85  Conclusions: We report a versatile method of CD56+CTC detection in SCLC. Numeration of 
86  CD56+CTC  at  diagnosis  is  correlated  with  disease  extension.  Isolated  CD56+CTC  are 
87  tumorigenic and a distinct mutational profile. We report a minimal gene set as a unique 
88  signature of CD56+CTC and identify new affected biological pathways enriched in EpCAM-
89  independent isolated CTC in SCLC.

93  Introduction 
94   
95  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for 1.6 
96  million deaths per year (1). Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive subset of lung 
97  cancer, representing 10 to 15% of lung cancers and characterized by rapid-onset symptoms 
98  due to high tumor growth rate (2). At diagnosis, most patients present an extensive stage 
99  disease (ES-SCLC) for whom the recommended treatment has been for the last decades a 
100  palliative  platinum-based  chemotherapy  regimen.  Even  if  recently,  the  combination  of 
101  chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors showed substantial outcomes improvement 
102  in two phase III trials (3,4), the prognosis remains poor with a median overall survival of 
103  about one year. For patients diagnosed with limited stage disease (LS-SCLC), concomitant 
104  chemo-radiotherapy is the recommended treatment option showing a median overall survival 
105  of over 20 months (5). 
106   
107  SCLC shows a high propensity for metastatic spreading and therefore generates a higher 
108  number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) compared to other tumor types (6). Recent studies 
109  have demonstrated that CTC isolated from patients diagnosed with SCLC can be deeply 
110  characterized at the genomic level and could have a potential prognostic significance (7–9). 
111  An in-depth analysis of single-cell CTC copy number variation (CNV) by whole-genome 
112  sequencing in a cohort of 31 SCLC patients was used to create a CNV classifier that could 
113  reliably predict chemosensitivity (10). However, these genomic analyses, especially on single 
114  cell CTC are not sustainable in routine clinical practice. Moreover, it should be noted that in 
115  most studies, CTC isolation was based on the expression of epithelial markers (EpCAM). It is 
116  well documented that  tumor  cells migrating through the bloodstream undergo  epithelio-
117  mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized by the loss of expression of epithelial markers

118  expression (11,12). Coherently, studies using a EpCAM-independent isolation method show a 
119  higher detection rate of CTC (13). A recent immunofluorescence study on a large cohort of 
120  108 SCLC patients demonstrate that EpCAM-based methodology (Cellsearch®) was unable 
121  to detect CD56+ and/or TTF1+-CTC in more than 20% of patients (14). These results suggest 
122  that CTC isolation method relying on EpCAM markers does not circumvent the issue of EMT 
123  of CTC in SCLC. Consequently, there is a clear unmet need for comprehensive genomic 
124  studies  performed  on  CTC  isolated  independently  of  EpCAM  to  achieve  a  better 
125  understanding of the biology of SCLC. To explore such an avenue of research, we select the 
126  CD56 marker, frequently express at surface of the membrane of SCLC cells, as it will allow 
127  the isolation of living CTC from the blood of SCLC patients. 
128   
129  Here, we describe a versatile and easy-to-use workflow for the detection, count and isolation 
130  of CD56+CTC from whole blood samples in a prospective cohort of 33 newly diagnosed 
131  patients with SCLC at our institution. Phenotypic analysis of isolated cells confirmed their 
132  tumor  lineage.  Notably,  generation  of  CTC-Derived  Xenografts  (CDX)  in 
133  immunocompromised mice support the tumorigenic properties of CD56+CTC. Our findings 
134  indicate that while there are genes commonly altered in biopsies and CD56+CTC samples, 
135  there is noticeable mutational diversity in the liquid biopsies, highlighting a putative distinct 
136  molecular signature. Finally, CD56+CTC count at diagnosis was associated with the stage of 
137  the disease.

138  Materials and methods 
139  Patient and samples  
140  We conducted a prospective non-interventional study in our institution (Rennes University 
141  Hospital),  including  only  patients  with  a  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed 
142  chemotherapy-naïve SCLC and eligible to a systemic treatment, starting from April 2016. The 
143  data lock was planned in December 2021 for all patients that achieve a minimal follow-up of 
144  at least 6 months. The recruitment is still active beyond this date. Any active neoplasia other 
145  than SCLC or known HIV, HCV or HBV infection, were considered as exclusion criterion. 
146  CD56+CTC  were  numerated  and  isolated  from  a  whole  blood  sample,  before  the  first 
147  administration of any cytotoxic agent and when disease relapsed (Fig 1A). Paired tumor tissue 
148  samples  were  obtained  for  four  patients  in  order  to  compare  CD56+CTC  and  biopsies 
149  genomic characteristics. LS-SCLC was defined as disease confined to one hemi-thorax and 
150  that  could  be  safely  encompassed  in  a  single  radiation  field,  otherwise  patients  were 
151  considered ES-SCLC. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASCL) 
152  eighth edition of the TNM Classification for small cell lung cancer was used to stage patient’s 
153  SCLC (15). Chemosensitive status was defined as patient without progressive disease within 3 
154  months after the first-line of treatment, as opposed to chemorefractory status. Progression-free 
155  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  start  of  chemotherapy  until  disease 
156  progression or death from any cause and assessed using RECIST version 1.1. Overall survival 
157  (OS) was defined as the time from the start of chemotherapy until death from any cause. 
158  Patients who had not progressed at the time of the statistical analysis or who were lost to 
159  follow-up before progression or death were censored at their last evaluation. This study was 
160  conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by Rennes 
161  University hospital ethic committee (n° 15.120). All participants provided informed consent, 
162  according French national regulation for non-interventional studies.

164  Workflow Isolation of CD56+CTC from whole blood  
165  The first step consists in a CTC enrichment from whole blood sample by immunomagnetic 
166  negative  selection  using  the  EasySep™  Direct  Human  CTC  Enrichment  Kit  (StemCell 
167  Technologies®,  Vancouver,  Canada)  according  to  manufacturer  instruction.  Because  we 
168  expected to  isolate  a  very  small  number  of  cells  and  to  accurately  sort  the CTCs, the 
169  remaining cells were mixed with 1x105 PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Cell 
170  suspension was washed in PBS 2% BSA and incubated with saturating concentrations of 
(cid:0)
171  fluorescent labelled antibodies against human CD56, CD45 and Cd235a (Miltenyi, Bergisch 
172  Gladbach, Germany) for 15 min at 4°C.  Cells were then washed with PBS 2%-BSA and 
173  analyzed and sorted by flow cytometry using a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin 
174  Lakes, NJ). The population of interest was gated according to its CD56/CD45 criteria to avoid 
175  NK lymphocytes contamination (exclusion of CD56+/CD45+ cells). Cells CD56+/CD45- 
176  were sorted, centrifuged, and immediately freeze at -80°C. CD45+ PBMC were used as a 
177  negative  control.  Data  were  analyzed  with  FlowJo™  Software  (Ashland,  OR:  Becton, 
178  Dickinson and Company).  
179   
180  Pathway analysis and comparison of genomic mutational patterns between biopsy and paired 
181  CD56+CTC  
182  Detailed methods for PBMC isolation, extraction of DNA, whole exome sequencing and 
183  variant annotation workflow can be found in the supplemental data. . Complete analysis was 
184  performed utilising various state-of-the-art tools. Unless stated otherwise, all bioinformatics 
185  analyses were performed using shell interface command line, on a Linux-based 64GB RAM/ 
186  12 processor cluster server (Ubuntu 18.04). Initially, to unravel the common mutational 
187  patterns between CTCs and matched biopsies, a simple Venn diagram/overlap analysis was

188  performed for each patient separately at the variant level (based on SNVs & INDELs) and at 
189  the gene level. The final variants that were common in the remaining variant lists of CTC and 
190  paired  biopsy  samples  for  each  patient,  were  imported  to  the  BioInfoMiner  platform 
191  (https://bioinfominer.com) for the functional interrogation of the perturbed pathways in the 
192  CTC and biopsy samples utilizing different hierarchical and ontological vocabularies (Gene 
193  Ontology & Reactome Pathways) (16). Additionally, in order to investigate the mutational 
194  relatedness of CTC and biopsy samples, based on their mutational profiles in the six base 
195  substitution catalogues, the R package MutationalPatterns (v 1.10.0) was used (17). Finally, 
196  semantic  similarity  (GO  functional  similarity)  based  on  the  aforementioned  pathway 
197  enrichment analysis was performed between CTC and biopsy samples for each patient, to 
198  identify any common molecular mechanisms. 
199   
200  Derivation of an informative gene signature of CD56+CTC samples 
201  For the derivation of a minimal gene set, expanding the molecular profile of the circulating 
202  tumor cell samples in the SCLC patients, we applied a data mining approach based on the 
203  aforementioned results of the WES computational analysis (see supplemental material and 
204  methods for details). 
205   
206  In vivo xenograft experiments 
207  NSG  (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid  Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice  were  purchased  from  Charles  River 
208  Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Mice were subcutaneously injected with a cell suspension 
209  (obtained after the first step of circulating tumor cell isolation) on the left flank with Matrigel 
210  (v/v) (Corning, Corning NY), as previously described (9). Tumor size was monitored using 
211  calliper twice per week. All animal procedures met the European Community Directive 
212  guidelines (Agreement B35-238-40 Biosit Rennes, France) and were approved by the local

213  ethics committee (Agreement APAFIS # 7163; CEEA - 007 regional ethics committee of Brittany; 
214  France), ensuring the breed ing and the daily monitoring of the animals in the best conditions 
215  of  well-being  according  to  the  law  and  the  rule  of  3R  (Reduce-Refine-Replace).  All 
216  experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. After 
217  tumor growth mice were euthanized (cervical dislocation) when tumors reached 1000 mm3 
218  and tumors were harvested and cut in two pieces (one used for cell culture and the other for 
219  formalin-fixation). All experiments on live animals are reported here in accordance with 
220  ARRIVE guidelines. Refer to supplemental material & methods for RNAseq analysis and 
221  identification of SCLC patient subtype. 
222  Statistical analysis 
223  Demographic and  descriptive data are  given as  the  median  with  the range. Categorical 
224  variables were compared with the Fisher exact test or the Pearson X2 test, and quantitative 
225  variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. Two-tailed P-
226  values were reported, with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier 
227  method with log-rank test was used to perform survival analysis. Finally, binomial logistic 
(cid:0) ≤
228  regression model was built with the CD56+CTC count ( 7 CD56+CTC or  7 CD56+CTC/ml 
229  of blood) as the dependent variable. The pre-specified cut-off of 7 CD56+CTC/ml was 
230  chosen, based on study investigating prognosis of CTC in SCLC which shows that more than 
231  50 CTC/7.5ml (equivalent to 6.6 CTC/ml) correlate with survival (6). GraphPad Prism for 
232  Windows software (version 5.03; Graph Pad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) was used for the 
233  statistical and survival analyses.

234  Results 
235  CD56+CTC isolated from whole blood samples are tumorigenic 
236  To isolate CD56+CTC from SCLC patients, we have set up a two steps protocol. First, 
237  hematopoietic cells and platelets were depleted and then CD56+CTC were isolated by cell 
238  sorting, using CD56 as a positive selection marker and CD45 as a negative selection marker 
239  to avoid NK cells contamination (Fig 1B). Based on the technical validation of the isolation 
240  method (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), we processed all the samples immediately after 
241  collection. A representative example of flow cytometry gating strategy used for cell sorting is 
242  shown  in  Figure  1B  (right  panel).  In  order  to  establish  the  tumorigenic  proprieties  of 
243  CD56+CTC, we performed CDX generation through implantation of isolated CD56+CTC on 
244  the  flank  of  nude  mice,  according  to  previous  published  methodology  (9).  Out  of  five 
245  attempts, CD56+CTC from two patients generated tumors in mice (Figure 1C). Subsequent 
246  immunohistochemistry analysis on these CDX tumors show positivity for commonly used 
247  markers for SCLC diagnosis: CD56, synaptophysin and chromogranin A, demonstrating the 
248  stability of the patient’s neuroendocrine tumor lineage (Fig. 1D). Moreover, in vitro CTC-
249  derived cell lines were obtained from two patient’s samples and amplified in culture (Fig. 
250  1D). Consistently with the recent classification of SCLC, CDX model derived from patient 30 
251  was successfully classified with an ASCL1 transcriptomic profile (Fig. 1E). Altogether, these 
252  results  confirmed  the  tumorigenic  properties  of  CD56+CTC  isolated  from  whole  blood 
253  samples of patients with a treatment-naïve SCLC. 
254   
255  CD56+CTC share common genomic alterations with SCLC tissue biopsies but display a 
256  distinct mutational signature 
257  To further characterize CD56+CTC at the genomic level, we submitted the CTC samples, 
258  matched PBMC and tumor biopsies to whole-exome-sequencing for four patients in our 
259  cohort. The average sequencing coverage (up to 135X and with a minimum depth of 20X)

260  was 0.70, 0.87 and 0.88 for CTC, biopsy and PBMC respectively (Table 1). Many genes 
261  commonly found to be altered according to large scale genomic studies of small cell lung 
262  cancer (18), were also detected in our genomic analysis (Fig. 2A). Alterations in TP53 or 
263  RB1, the two most consistently altered genes in SCLC, were found in CD56+CTC of 3 
264  patients (75%). CD56+CTC from one patient didn’t show any TP53 or RB1 mutation but 
265  CNV analysis revealed a mono-allelic deletion of both genes (Fig. 2B).  Moreover, our 
266  analysis  showed  that  the  altered  pathway  commonly  found  in  SCLC,  such  as  NOTCH 
267  signaling, were also observed in our CD56+CTC samples (Supplemental Fig. 3B). These 
268  results confirmed that the genetic profiles of CD56+CTC are similar to the known genomic 
269  landscape of SCLC.  
270  Interestingly, the mutational load in CD56+CTC was much higher than in matched tumor 
271  biopsies for all patients (Table 1). The mean mutational load in CD56+CTC and tumor 
272  biopsies was 188.02 and 6.44 mutations/Mb respectively. The majority of mutations found in 
273  the tissues were confirmed in CD56+CTC (except for patient 06 were only 39/103 mutations 
274  where shared between samples) (Fig. 2C and supplemental  material and method). C>A 
275  transversion, classically associated with tobacco exposure, was the dominant mutation type in 
276  the tissue biopsies (Fig. 2D). Conversely, C>T transversion (outside CpG sites) was dominant 
277  in CTC, suggesting that drivers of mutagenesis might be distinct in CD56+CTC. In line with 
278  this hypothesis, hierarchical clustering of samples based on their mutational patterns using 
279  COSMIC mutational signatures (v2-March 2015) tended to discriminate between blood and 
280  biopsy  samples  (Supplemental  Fig.3A).  Even  if  CTC  and  biopsy  samples  showed  high 
281  similarities with multiple signatures, biopsies showed a higher correlation with signature 4 
282  (related to tobacco mutagens), 24 & 29 (transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations);

284  mismatch repair) with signatures 19 & 30 (etiology unknown), supporting the idea of distinct 
285  “circulating” drivers of mutagenesis in CD56+CTC. 
286  To explore altered signaling pathways in CD56+CTC, we exploited BioInfoMiner (BIM)  
287  web  platform  which  implements  robust  statistical  and  network  analysis  for  functional 
288  enrichment investigation in order to highlight the most important biological mechanisms. 
289  Thus, we identified a genomic signature comprised of 75 hub genes for the CD56+CTC at the 
290  time  of  diagnosis  (Fig.2E).  In  order  to  capture  holistically  the  perturbed  biological 
291  components that are related to SCLC pathophysiology and progression, we utilized one of the 
292  most comprehensive biomedical vocabularies REACTOME pathway analysis. Subsequent 
293  functional  enrichment  analysis  of  the  compact  gene  set  revealed  altered  biological 
294  mechanisms either directly or indirectly associated with lung cancer progression (related to 
295  neural  cell  adhesion,  extracellular  matrix  organization,  hypoxia  or  immune  response) 
296  (Fig.2F). This analysis also stressed the importance of understudied processes in SCLC: 
297  sumoylation  and  transcriptional  regulation  by  AP-2  and  RUNX2.  Subsequently,  three 
298  genomic  databases  of  SCLC  (Cancer  Gene  Census,  Intogen  driver  genes  and 
299  MycancerGenome) were analyzed with BIM leading to the identification of 22, 17 and 9 hub 
300  genes  respectively  (Supplemental  Table  1).  Interestingly,  23  of  the  75  hub  genes  from 
301  CD56+CTC, such as ERBB2, TP53, CREBBP and NF1, were found enriched in at least 1 of 
302  the 3 queried databases, illustrating the high affinity of the liquid biopsies to recapitulate the 
303  molecular genomic landscape of small cell lung cancer. The REACTOME pathway analysis 
304  of the 23 hub genes further confirmed that the altered biological mechanisms found in 
305  CD56+CTCs correspond to those found in SCLC, with the addition of the p53 signaling 
306  pathways (Supplemental Fig.3D).

307  Altogether,  these  observations  support  the  hypothesis  that  CD56+CTC  can  reliably 
308  recapitulate  the  mutational status  of  treatment-naive  SCLC  tumors and  may  represent a 
309  comprehensive way of capturing the whole mutational picture of SCLC. 
310   
311  Cohort demographics 
312  From April 2016 to April 2021, 46 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Seven 
313  patients met the exclusion criteria and 39 patients had CD56+CTC isolation from blood 
314  samples. For five patients, isolated CD56+CTC were used for in vivo/ex vivo culture and one 
315  patient withdrew consent. Finally, the number of CD56+CTC at diagnosis was available for 
316  33 patients who were therefore included in the statistical analysis (Supplementary Fig.4). The 
317  demographic and descriptive statistics of the cohort are presented in Table 2. Patients were 
318  predominantly male (69.7%), active smoker (69.7%) and had mainly  an extensive-stage 
319  disease at diagnosis (66.7%). Of note, a large proportion of the patients progressed within 3 
320  months after the end of the first-line of chemotherapy and was considered chemorefractory 
321  (45.5%). Based on the pre-specified cut-off of 7 CD56+CTC/ml, two groups of patients were 
322  compared. The two groups were well balanced with respect with age, sex, smoking exposure, 
323  chemosensitivity or median follow-up (Table 2). However, the group with more than 7 
324  CD56+CTC/ml at diagnosis was enriched in patients with ES-SCLC (85.7% vs 52.7%), 
325  without reaching statistical significance (Fisher's exact test; p= 0.067). Remarkably, the five 
326  patients without any metastatic localization at diagnosis show a low CD56+CTC count (mean: 
327  3.23±3.30 cells/ml). Two patients show no detectable CD56+CTC in blood samples: one had 
328  LS-SCLC and the other one had a low thoracic tumor burden associated with multiple 
329  cerebral and medullary metastases.

332  In order to correlate tumor burden and propensity to detect CTC in SCLC patients, we 
333  compared the number of CD56+CTC according to the initial stage of the disease. Patients 
334  with ES-SCLC show significantly  higher number of CD56+CTC compared with patient 
335  diagnosed with LS-SCLC (respective median of 7.95 vs 2.00; p=0.014) (Fig. 3A). To gain 
336  further insight into the specific clinical parameters associated with higher numbers of CTCs 
337  detected, we looked at each descriptor of the TNM classification (Fig 3B). Even if we 
338  observed a trend toward a higher count of CD56+CTC in patient with more advanced T, N or 
339  M status, statistical significance was not reached. As of December 2021, a relapse or death 
340  event occurred in all patients in our cohort after first line-treatment. The median PFS was 5.2 
341  months in the overall cohort with 5.2 months and 5.3 months in the low CD56+CTC group 
342  and high CD56+CTC group, respectively (HR=0.80 CI 95% [0.39-1.56]; p=0.5) (figure 3C, 
343  left panel). Median overall survival was 8.1 months in the overall cohort and no statistically 
344  significant  difference  was  observed  between  the  two  groups:  10.16  months  in  the  low 
345  CD56+CTC group versus 8.7 months in the high CD56+CTC group (HR=0.92 CI 95% [0.43-
346  1.93]; p=0.8) (figure 3C, right panel). Importantly, at the time of analysis, no difference in 
347  survival was observed between ES-SCLC and LS-SCLC in our cohort (Supplemental Fig.5). 
348   
349  Somatic evolution of CD56+CTC at progression after first-line treatment 
350  In order to decipher the tumor biology of SCLC at relapse, we conducted CD56+CTC 
351  isolation for patient 04 at clinical progression (costal metastasis after 3 cycles of carboplatin-
352  etoposide). CD56+CTC counts were higher at relapse compared to diagnosis: 42 cells/ml 
353  versus 8 cells/ml respectively. However, WES showed that the mutation load decreased 
354  almost two fold in CD56+CTC at relapse (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, most of the mutations 
355  (1667/2497=66.7%) observed in relapsed CD56+CTC were also detected in CD56+CTC 
356  isolated at diagnosis (Fig. 3E). Conducting functional analysis enrichment, we were able to

357  identify differentially altered pathways between diagnosis and relapse circulating CD56+ 
358  tumor clones (Fig. 3F). Notably, signaling pathways known to drive tumorigenesis in SCLC 
359  and  currently  investigated  in  targeted  therapy  trials  (DLL3-targeting  molecules  for  the 
360  NOTCH pathway or PI3KCA/AKT inhibitors for the MAPK pathway) were specifically 
361  implicated in relapsed CD56+CTC (19,20). These results suggest that overcoming relapse 
362  after first-line systemic treatment may require targeting these signaling pathways, as we 
363  speculate this gives a selective advantage for resurgent SCLC clones.

365  Discussion 
366  This  prospective  study  demonstrates  the  feasibility  of  an  EpCAM-independent  and 
367  immunofluorescence-based CTC isolation in SCLC and its application in clinical practice. We 
368  confirmed that CD56+CTC display a neuroendocrine tumor lineage and conserve tumorigenic 
369  properties  in  vivo  and  in  vitro.  Coherently,  whole-exome  sequencing  validated  that 
370  CD56+CTC show typical genomic alterations and classical altered pathways commonly found 
371  in SCLC (e.g. TP53 mutation, RB1 loss) but they are also characterized by distinct mutational 
372  patterns. We prospectively observed that ES-SCLC display a higher CD56+CTC count at 
373  diagnosis  compared  to  LS-SCLC.  Finally,  we  show  that  detection  of  CD56+CTC  at 
374  progression after first-line treatment uncover new oncogenic pathways implicated in relapse 
375  circulating tumor cells. 
376  In line with previous results in non-small cell lung cancer, EpCAM-independent detection of 
377  CTC show a high sensitivity (21). Indeed, median number of  CTCs at baseline using 
378  CellSearch® approach in a large SCLC cohort was 14 CTC/7.5ml of blood (14), compared to 
379  28 CTC/7.5ml of blood in our cohort. Interestingly, in a recent cohort restricted to ES-SCLC, 
380  the median number of CTC at diagnosis using CellSearch® was 30 CTC/7.5 ml of blood (22), 
381  whereas it reaches 225 CTC/7.5 ml of blood in the ES-SCLC patients in our cohort. As EMT 
382  is expected to be a more potent phenomenon when metastatic spread occurs, we speculate that 
383  our EpCAM-independent method allow us to capture CTCs from SCLC that would remain 
384  undetected  using  CellSearch®  approach,  especially  in  late-stage  SCLC.  Supporting  this 
385  hypothesis, similar observations were made in a large cohort of 108 SCLC patients where 
386  CellSearch®  failed  to  detect  CTCs  for  22  patients  whereas  immunofluorescence-based 
387  approach succeeded (14). Moreover, intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity was observed for 
388  EMT markers in both CTCs and circulating tumor microemboli in lung cancer (23) and could 
389  partially explain these discrepancies.

390  To our knowledge, this study is the first to report genomic features of EpCAM-independent 
391  CTC  in  SCLC.  Beyond  the  confirmation  of  typical  genomic  alteration  of  SCLC  in 
392  CD56+CTC, we show that the mutational load was high compared to paired tumor biopsies or 
393  published data on CTC of SCLC. This suggests that our EpCAM-independent method allows 
394  us to  capture  more  exhaustively  CTC  heterogeneity and altered signaling pathways.  To 
395  support this hypothesis we report a set of 75 hub genes altered in CD56+CTC, comprising 23 
396  core genes shared with public SCLC genomic databases. Unique CTC genomic signatures 
397  have been described in others solid malignancies (24,25), highlighting cell populations with 
398  different functional or metastatic potential. In the context of SCLC, larger genomic studies 
399  considering single-cell sequencing of EpCAM-independent CTC are needed to confirm the 
400  new  pathways  we  identified  as  altered  in  our  dataset.  Further  longitudinal  data  from 
401  sequencing of CTC at diagnosis and relapse are underway to establish firmly the relevant 
402  common mechanisms that might drive resistance to therapy. 
403  Prognostic value of CTC from SCLC has been extensively reported before. Indeed, Hou et al. 
404  reported that more than 50 CTCs/7.5 ml of blood at diagnosis has a detrimental effect on PFS 
405  and OS (6). Similarly, Su et al. and Carter et al. reported that copy-number-alteration (CNA) 
406  analysis from single cell CTC could predict chemosensitity status and PFS (7,10). In our 
407  study, no difference of CD56+CTC numeration was observed based on the chemosensitivity 
408  status of tumors and no association with prognosis was found based on the pre-specified cut-
409  off value of 7 CD56+CTC/ml. In line with this result, a recent work from Masseratakis et al. 
410  et using an immunofluorescence CTC-isolation method did not show correlation between 
411  CD56+CTC and clinical outcomes (14). Altogether, we hypothesized that CD56+CTC might 
412  not correlate with the invasive potential or the aggressiveness of the primitive tumor and/or 
413  might not dictate tumor sensitivity to systemic therapy. One caveat to this hypothesis is the 
414  absence of an impact on survival of the stage of the disease in our cohort. Some confounding

415  factors and the relative small size of our cohort might have limited the power of the survival 
416  analysis. A better understanding of the biology of EpCAM-negative CTC and of the processes 
417  of EMT in SCLC is needed to definitely address this question. 
418  Our study has several limitations. The cohort is relatively small and patients were recruited in 
419  a  single  institution.  A  direct  comparison  of  EpCAM-independent  isolation  method  and 
420  CellSearch® could not be performed as this technology is not available in our institution. We 
421  also acknowledge that using CD56 as positive CTC selection marker might preferentially 
422  capture CTC  retaining  neuroendocrine phenotype.  However, it  is  unclear  today  if  EMT 
423  impacts  neuroendocrine  state  of  CTC.      Masseratakis  et  al,  confirmed  the  favorable 
424  comparison of an immunofluorescence-based CTC isolation from SCLC (using CD56 and/or 
425  TTF1) compared to the CellSearch® technology (14). However, no study has explored to date 
426  the potential co-expression between EpCAM and CD56 markers on CTC from SCLC. Of 
427  note, as combination of anti PD-L1 with chemotherapy was not at a standard of care during 
428  the larger inclusion period of the study, we couldn’t assess the relevance of CD56+CTC upon 
429  immunotherapy.  However,  as  EMT  has  been  associated  with  inflammatory  tumor 
430  microenvironment and elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules in lung 
431  cancer (26), exploring the relation between CD56+CTC and EMT in the context of the new 
432  immunotherapeutic strategies in SCLC would be an important avenue to explore.

434  Conclusion 
435  Isolation of CD56+CTC using an immunofluorescence-based EpCAM-independent method at 
436  diagnosis  is  feasible  in  SCLC  and  might  capture  more  efficiently  tumor  genomic 
437  heterogeneity. CD56+CTC are characterized by a high mutation load and a distinct mutational 
438  signature from paired tumor biopsies. Above classical pathways altered in SCLC, we identify 
439  new  biological  processes  specifically  affected  in  CD56+CTC.  High  numeration  of 
440  CD56+CTC is associated with ES-SCLC. Finally, detection of CD56+CTC at progression 
441  after first-line treatment might help to understand somatic evolution of SCLC and elaborate 
442  strategies overcoming therapeutic resistance.

532  Figure 1. Isolation of CD56+CTCs and generation of pre-clinical models. A. Schematic 
533  workflow of the CTC-CPC study. B. Isolation procedure of CD56+CTC from whole blood 
534  sample (left panel); Representative result of flow cytometry cell sorting (right panel). C. 
535  Circulating tumor cells-derived xenograft (CDX) obtained from isolated CD56+CTC. D. IHC 
536  phenotype of in vivo models obtained from isolated CD56+CTC (upper panel); Ex vivo cell 
537  lines  obtained  from  isolated  CD56+CTC  (lower  panel).  E.  Heatmap  and  hierarchical 
538  clustering based on the expression data of the four (established) key transcription regulators 
539  that are (commonly) used to identify the SCLC molecular subtype. Samples are derived from 
540  50 SCLC cell lines, from CCLE with known molecular subtypes and from one patient of 
541  unknown SCLC subtype (CEM 18-03). For every gene, the color scale indicates its relative 
542  expression, from blue (low) to red (high). 
543   
544  Figure 2. Genomic characterization of CD56+CTC. A. Heatmap of genomic alterations of 
545  SCLC candidate genes (CTC samples of 4 patients). Mutation rates are displayed in the top 
546  panel. B. Somatic copy number alterations in CD56+CTC (amplifications in red and deletions 
547  in blue); lower panel shows copy number alteration in published SCLC genomic studies. C. 
548  Venn  diagrams  represent  non  synonymous  mutations  (SNPs  &  InDels)  in  biopsies  and 
549  CD56+CTCs. D. Mutation spectrum plot illustrates the relative contribution of the 6 base 
550  substitution types to the point mutation spectrum for each patient sample. Bars show the mean 
551  relative contribution of each mutation type over all patient samples per sample type (biopsy 
552  and CD56+CTC) and error bars indicate the standard deviation. E. Derived genomic signature 
553  comprised of 75 genes for the CD56+CTC at the time of diagnosis. F. Analysis of the 
554  Reactome pathway of the 75 genes CD56+CTC genomic signature (ranked according p-
555  value). 
556   
557  Figure 3. Clinical significance of CD56+CTC at diagnosis and somatic evolution of CTC 
558  at relapse. A. Diagnosis numeration of CD56+CTC according to SCLC staging (*: p<0.05; # 
559  : two values outside the limits of the graph). B. Numeration of CD56+CTC according to the 
560  8th TNM IASCL classification (ns : non-significant) C. Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-
561  free-survival (left panel) or overall survival (right panel) according to the numeration of 
562  CD56+CTC with a pre-specified cut-off value of 7 CTC/ml. D. Mutational load of all samples 
563  from patient 04. R.  Venn diagrams representing non synonymous mutations (SNPs & InDels) 
564  in CTCs at diagnosis and after relapse (right) for patient 04. F. Analysis of the REACTOME 
565  pathways of the common non synonymous genes (1667) at diagnosis and after relapse.
