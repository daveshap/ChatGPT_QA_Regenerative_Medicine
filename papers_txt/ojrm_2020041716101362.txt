1. Introduction 
At the time when I am writing this manuscript, more than 76,000 2019-nCoV 
infected patients have died, out of a total of more than 1,362,000 cases reported 
around the world in more than 190 countries, and the number is increasing re-
lentlessly every hour of the day [1]. From amongst the remaining patients, 94% 
(nearly a million patients) have mild condition while 5% of patients are seriously 
ill. These figures are alarming and warrant drastic measures to stop the situation 
from sliding down further to prevent any human catastrophe. Although con-
certed efforts involving the researchers in both academia and pharmaceutical 
industries are underway to restrain the spread of infection and find its treat-

ment, there is little insight in terms of vaccination or pharmacological options 
for the treatment of 2019-nCoV infected patients [2]. Several anti-viral drugs 
with the diverse mechanism of action, attacking the virus by interfering with its 
attachment to the cells to its replication and exit from the infected cells, are cur-
rently being assessed for their efficacy against 2019-nCoV [3]. The latest break-
through in the pharmacological management of 2019-nCoV infection has been 
reported with the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 
which has given some hope amidst the existing COVID-19 scare [4]. CQ and 
HCQ are the semi-synthetic derivatives of quinine; cinchona bark-derived alka-
loid with proven antimalarial activity although these anti-malarial drugs have 
nearly lost their clinical use due to the malarial parasite developing resistance 
[5]. Encouraged by the data from QC and HCQ against SARS-CoV [6] [7] and 
their successful use in Wuhan, China, a research group from Marseille, France 
has published the results of a non-randomized open-label single-arm study in 
confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infected patients. The patients received 600 mg 
daily dose of hydroxychloroquine (in three divided doses of 200 mg each) with 
or without azithromycin in hospitalized patients [8]. The data showed 70% of 
the HCQ treated patients as virologically cured on day 6 as compared to 12.5% 
control patients from another center who declined to be treated with the study 
protocol. Additionally, treatment with azithromycin synergistically enhanced the 
effect of HCQ. Efforts are also underway to screen the existing armory of antivirals 
against 2019-nCoV. Wang et al., have reported that HCQ combined with nucleo-
tide analog remdesivir was effective to inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro [9]. Currently, 2 
phase-III randomized open-label trials (NCT04292899; NCT04292730) sponsored 
by the National Institute of Health (NIH), are in the phase of enrolment to assess 
remdesivir in persons with COVID-19. Similarly, Europe is also starting clinical 
trials involving 3200 patients for the assessment of some anti-viral agents in-
cluding remdesivir and CQ [10]. 
Incidentally, chloroquine has been included in the guidelines issued by the 
National Health Commission of the Peoples’ Republic of China (NHCPRC) for 
the treatment of 2019-nCoV caused pneumonia. This short paper discusses the 
possible use of passive immunotherapy with chloroquine and its derivatives as a 
combinatorial therapeutic intervention for 2019-nCoV infected patients. 
2. Coronaviruses 
Coronaviruses constitute a large family of enveloped, positive single-stranded 
RNA viruses, which are mostly found in the animals but some of them have po-
tential infectivity in the humans with pathogenic consequences, mostly related to 
the upper respiratory tract. 2019-nCoV is the third major spread of coronavi-
ruses after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East 
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV during the last 2 decades, inflicting heavy 
losses in terms of human life, as well as a serious global economic setback [10] 
[11]. Whereas both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were of zoonotic origin, the ori-

gin of 2019-nCoV is still debatable [12]. 
3. Convalescent Serum Therapy for Passive Immunization:   
A Viable Option for COVID-19 Patients 
Passive immunization strategy is not new to the treatment of both bacterial and 
viral infections as it started in the 20th century with the use of animal sera to pas-
sively support the compromised immune system of patients using specific anti-
bodies from an exogenous source. Subsequently, with the advancements in the 
purification and fractionation technology, the use of animal sera was replaced 
with the human-derived sera [13]. However, since the inception of hybridoma 
technology by Kohler and Milstein in the early 80’s and the subsequent advent 
and progress made therein, the use of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and their 
derivative fractions have substituted the use of animal and human sera for many 
diseases. MAbs provide a renewable source of preparations with high specificity 
and standardized potency. Currently, more than 80 FDA approved MAb prepa-
rations are available in the market for patients with pathological conditions en-
compassing from cancer to cardiovascular pathologies [14]. Recent advancement 
in the passive immunization approach is the use of the chimeric antigen receptor 
T-cells (CAR T-cells) approach [15]. 
The passive immunization approach may be given serious consideration as a 
viable option to passively immunize the 2019-nCoV infected patients by conva-
lescent serum therapy wherein serum obtained from the patients who have sur-
vived and recovered from the infection can be used [16]. 
Passive immunization offers the patient a short-lived protection, which may 
vary in duration from a few weeks to a few months. The use of human serum has 
been extensively studied in culturing of the donor cells for in vitro expansion 
and has been preferred over animal serum to enhance their immunological ac-
ceptance by the recipient post-engraftment. Similarly, autologous patient serum 
is regularly used as a medium to suspend cells for transplantation in cell-based 
therapy procedures. The use of convalescent patient serum is surely a superior 
choice in terms of curtailed immunogenicity as compared to blood plasma 
preparations due to their depleted protein contents. The situation warrants op-
timization of protocols in accordance with the existing Good Manufacturing 
Practices to initiate a drive to collect 250 - 300 ml blood from nearly 293,000 
convalescent patients to secure nearly 4.5 × 107 ml of their precious serum that 
may be enough to treat the patients with an active infection under the prevailing 
circumstances. Moreover, combining convalescent serum therapy to enhance the 
compromised immune system of the patients with the pharmacological inter-
vention using CQ, HCQ, and anti-viral agents etc., the combinatorial approach 
may allow the researchers to treat 2019-nCoV infected patients. While pharma-
cological intervention will provide anti-viral effects, serum therapy will be sup-
portive for the depleted immune system of the patient. The use of combinatorial 
approach will allow ample time to researchers to develop an anti-2019-nCoV
