1. Introduction 
Hui et al., 2020 reported in late December 2019 that China had announced 27 
residents had fallen ill with an unknown viral infection in Wuhan of Hubei 
Province, China and most of the infected individuals were found to be the stall 
holders at the city’s Huanan Sea Food Market. After a week, 44 more individuals 
presented with similar symptoms. Later, the investigators isolated the virus from 
the patient samples and they genetically sequenced the viral samples and re-
ported to WHO; in the interim the virus was given the name Novel Coronavirus 
discovered in 2019 (2019-nCoV/nCOVID-19) and subsequently named as Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Further, many 
investigations were conducted to identify the cause and it was reported that peo-
ple from Hubei province might have shown the symptoms in early November, 
2019. This novel coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) has neither been identified 
nor detected in human hosts until this nCOVID-19 outbreak in China. The 
nCOVID-19 virus showed 79% genotypic similarity to the SARS coronavirus 
and was closely related to β-coronavirus from the origin of bats which suggests 
that bats are the most likely animal reservoir hosts for the transmission of this 
emerging viral pathogen, however, this transmission of infection to humans be-
lieved to have occurred due to an intermediate host transmission like pangolin 
[2] [3]. 
A substantial increase in the infection rates happened because of human-to- 
human transmission of this nCOVID-19 virus and by the end of February, 2020 
the infection rates and new cases were found to be significantly reduced in China 
but on the other hand, subsequent transmission and infection rates were found 
to be increasing outside China including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, USA, 
France and UK. The World Health Organization declared nCOVID-19 as a 
Pandemic on 11th March, 2020 and more than 174,000 confirmed positive cases 
and approximately 7500 deaths occurred globally [1].  
Many species of animal and human hosts have been affected by coronaviruses 
and the family of coronaviruses remains relatively obscure probably because of 
no severe human diseases attributing to this virus. However, in the year 2003, it 
became clear that these coronaviruses were responsible for severe acute respira-
tory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Since then, two new human respiratory coro-

naviruses  namely  Middle  East  respiratory  syndrome  related  coronavirus 
(MERS-CoV) and nCOVID-19 have been described. In the year 1968, scientists 
named this virus as “coronavirus” because of its crown like morphological ap-
pearance  and  it  belongs  to  the  family  coronaviridae  with  two  subfamilies 
namely, the coronaviruses and the toroviruses. Later, it was found that these vi-
ruses were also responsible in causing enteric diseases in cattle and possibly in 
humans. 
2. Etiology of nCOVID-19 
There are 2 speculations regarding the origin of SARS-CoV-2 - 1) natural selec-
tion of animal host before zoonotic transfer and 2) natural selection in humans 
following zoonotic transfer [4]. The zoonotic source is not confirmed however 
genomic analysis suggested bats as the main reservoir. The isolated β-CoV 
shows 88% similarity to the sequence of two bat-derived SARS-like coronavi-
ruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 [5]. People with history of visit 
to Wuhan’s seafood market contracted this infection but in due course, it was 
revealed that in some individuals no record of seafood market visit had also 
contracted infection suggesting its capability of human to human transmission 
capability [6]. This can occur via direct contact with an infected person, exposed 
to coughing, sneezing, respiratory droplets or an aerosol which enter human 
lungs via inhalation through nose or mouth and via indirect contact i.e. as 
fomite transmission. Recent case series has put forward possibility of vertical 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mother to her new born; however it 
is not conclusive [7] [8] [9]. 
3. Coronavirus Classification/Taxonomy 
Based on the serological cross-reactivity characteristics, these coronaviruses are 
divided into three genera, i.e., group I to III [10] [11]. This was also confirmed 
by genome sequencing analysis [12]. The Group-I coronavirus includes animal 
pathogens such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine epidemic 
diarrhoea virus (PEDV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) as well as hu-
man coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HKU1; Group-II coronavirus includes patho-
gens of veterinary relevance such as Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), equine corona-
viruses, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus as well as human co-
ronavirus OC43, NL63 and Group-III includes only avian coronavirus such as 
IBV, pheasant coronavirus and turkey coronaviruses [13]. But, the Group-II vi-
ruses which infects mice and rats were also found to be as coronavirus prototype 
that were found responsible in causing infections like enteric diseases, hepatitis, 
encephalitis, respiratory diseases and chronic demyelination [14]. Many contro-
versies exist about the SARS-CoV that whether it belongs to a new group of co-
ronaviruses or a distant member of group [15]. The sequences of coronaviruses 
detected in Columbia livia (feral pigeon), Anser anser (Greylag goose) and Anas

platyrhynchos (mallard) and their phylogenetic analysis also confirms that these 
viruses belong to group-III [16]. There were two prototypes of human corona-
viruses found to cause common cold in humans namely OC43 and 229E pre-
vious to the emergence of SARS-CoV [17] and determined to have long specula-
tions about human coronaviruses with serious health issues such as multiple 
sclerosis [18], hepatitis [19] and enteric diseases in new borns [20]. 
4. Virion Structure and Function 
Coronaviruses (nCOVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) are enveloped viruses with round or 
pleomorphic structure of approximately 80 to 120 nm in diameter containing 
positive single-stranded RNA genome of 30 kb size [21] [22] (as shown in Fig-
ure 1). The RNA genome is complexed with basic nucleocapsid protein (N) to 
form a helical viral protein and these are spike proteins (S) which are the Type-I 
glycoprotein  that  forms  the  peplomers  on  the  virion  surface  giving  it  a 
crown-like structure (as shown in Figure 1). The membrane protein (M) which 
spans three times the viral membrane has a short N-terminal ectodomain and a 
cytoplasmic tail. The small membrane protein (E) is found to be highly hydro-
phobic in nature [23] and this spans twice the N and C terminals on the interior 
part of the virion [24]. There are still many other minor proteins present in the 
viral structure yet undetected and the genomes of all the coronaviruses were 
found to have similar structural characteristics [25]. For all coronaviruses, the 
structural proteins are encoded in order of S-E-M-N within the one third of the 
genome and each group of coronaviruses encodes a group of unique small pro-
teins while these are non-essential proteins and have been found to serve as ac-
cessory proteins to interact or interfere with the host innate immune responses 
which has not been demonstrated for any of these proteins [26] [27]. Untrans-
lated regions of coronaviruses (UTRs) on both 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome were 
believed to interact with the host and control the RNA replication process and 
the viral transcription has been reviewed in recent studies [28].

5. Replication of nCOVID-19 
Coronaviruses (nCOVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) attach to specific cellular receptors 
like ACE-2 with its spike protein (S) and this triggers a conformational change 
in the viral spike protein which mediates a fusion reaction between the virus and 
the cell membrane resulting in injecting the viral genetic material into the host 
cell. Upon entry, the 5’ end of the RNA genome, ORFs 1a and 1b are translated 
into polyproteins (pp 1a and pp 1b) and here, the polyproteins pp 1ab are trans-
lated through a frameshift mechanism occurring at a high frequency of 25% to 
30% [20] [28]. ORF 1a encodes one or two papain like protease enzymes and a 
picornavirus 3C-like protease which functions in processing the polyproteins 
into mature replicase proteins [29] and encoded in X domain of ORF 1a and 
processed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) along with helicase 
enzyme [30] as well as with other enzymatic activities [31]. An additional puta-
tive enzymatic activity of cyclic phosphodiesterase encodes the downstream 
process in ORF 2a and these multiple enzymatic activities play a vital role in 
metabolism of coronavirus RNA interaction with the host cell process [32]. The 
interaction between the viral spike protein (S) and the ACE-2 receptor on the 
host cell surface significantly initiates the infection process and the cryo-EM 
structure  analysis  has  revealed  the  binding  affinity  efficacy  of  nCOVID-19 
(SARS-CoV-2) S protein to ACE-2 receptor of about 10 to 20 times higher than 
that of SARS-CoV S protein [33] [34] and has higher transmissibility and conta-
giosity of nCOVID-19 as compared to SARS-CoV [35]. 
On the basis of genome sequence alignment and homology, SARS-CoV and 
SARS-CoV-2 (nCOVID-19) are found to have shared a highly conserved recep-
tor-binding domain (RBD) and there is 76% similarity of the domain of S pro-
tein sequence [22] [36] and 83% of similarity in their active sites [4]. Due to their 
much higher binding affinity to the cellular receptors the human to human 
transmission  of  the  virus  is  also  visibly  higher  when  compared  to  that  of 
SARS-CoV coronavirus outbreak and additional studies are required in this 
pandemic situation for better investigation of this possibility of higher transmis-
sion among individuals [37]. Based on these evidences, the natural evolution of 
nCOVID-19 or the SARS-CoV-2 was supported based on its overall molecular 
mechanisms and also scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed 
substantially from those known coronaviruses. Additionally, their viral resem-
blances were found in bats and pangolins. Hence, the scientists concluded that 
the nCOVID-19 coronavirus is the product of natural evolution ending any de-
liberate genetic engineering [38]. 
6. Pathogenesis of nCOVID-19 with Human Host 
nCOVID-19 patients show clinical manifestations such as fever, non-productive 
cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, myalgia, normal or decreased leukocyte counts with 
radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Recent evidences shows anosmia, hypos-
mia and dysgeusia to be considered in the list of symptoms associated with

nCOVID-19 infection [39]. As per several reports, the envelope spike glycopro-
tein play pivotal role in the entry. It recognizes and binds to its cellular receptor 
angiotensin  I  converting  enzyme  2  receptor  (ACE2R)  for  SARS-CoV  and 
SARS-CoV-2, CD209L (a C-type lectin, also called L-SIGN) for SARS-CoV, 
DPP4 for MERS-CoV [40]. Moreover the entry mechanism is also dependent on 
cellular protease like human airway trypsin like protease (HAT), cathepsins and 
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which facilitates splitting of spike 
protein and further penetration changes are established [41] [42]. Molecular 
studies explicatively stated that ACE2 receptors are widely distributed on the 
human cell surface, especially the alveolar type II cells (AT2) and capillary en-
dothelium with AT2 highly expressing TMPRSS2. Viral proteins and genome 
RNA are subsequently assembled into virions in endoplasmic reticulum or 
Golgi.  Lastly  from  endoplasmic-reticulum-Golgi  intermediate  compartment 
(ERGIC), the viral particles in the vesicles fuse with plasma membrane to release 
the virus [5] [6]. The Structural proteins are encoded by the four structural 
genes, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) 
genes (as shown in Figure 1). The ORF1ab is the largest gene in SARS-CoV-2 
which encodes the pp1ab protein and 15 nsps. The genomic variation between 
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such as the absence of 8a protein and fluctuation 
in the number of amino acids in 8b and 3c protein in SARSCoV-2 [6]. 
The mortality in nCOVID-19 patients is associated with onset of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the cytokine storm mechanism resulting in un-
controlled systemic inflammatory response from the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, IL-33, TNF-α, TGF-β) and 
chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL-10 etc) [5] [40]. It 
culminates into edema, dysfunction of the air exchange, acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and the secondary infection which may lead 
to death [42]. The key to treatment aims at avoiding or attenuating cytokine 
storm, and to restrict the entry of mononuclear cells via CD4 and CD8T cells (as 
shown in Figure 2). Case studies and analysis throw light on application of 
mesenchymal stem cells in such a situation. MSCs, with their powerful immu-
nomodulatory ability, may benefit by preventing or attenuating the cytokine 
storm [40]. 
7. Emerging Stem Cell Based Therapy   
for nCOVID-19 
Recent advances in molecular biology and regenerative medicine has promised 
induction of the activity of micro-molecules such as stem cells, bioactive materi-
als and growth factors promoting improved quality, structure, function and 
bio-mechanical strength of tissue regeneration and healing process. The cellular 
therapy induces cellular proliferation, chondrogenesis, angiogenesis and rejuve-
nation of degenerated tissue to attain micromolecular homeostasis.

The art of cellular therapy has revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine 
towards natural healing cascade. Among cellular therapy, mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) has homing ability, immunoregulatory nature, anti-inflammatory effects, 
and multilineage differentiation potential as reported by Ullah et al. [43] and 
Ramesh R et al. [44] (as shown in Figure 3). 
MSCs could act upon two ways in the nCOVID19 treatment, namely immu-
nomodulatory effects and differentiation ability. In nCOVID19 cases, acute res-
piratory distress is the result of SARS-CoV-2 infecting alveolar type II cells 
(AT2) and the capillary endothelium as mentioned by Hamming et al. [45]. The

pulmonary cells generally express ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) re-
ceptor and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) on their membrane. 
SARS-CoV-2 uses this ACE2 for the entry and the TMPRSS2 serine protease 
aids in S protein priming. These two membrane proteins (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) 
mediate viral entry into cells and also the spread of virus within the host [46]. 
According to F. Qi et al., the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only 
limited to pulmonary cells [47], they are widely expressed in the Cardiac, renal 
and hepatic tissues. Hence, patients with severe infection possibly along with 
dyspnoea also suffer from multiple organ failure, shock, heart failure, arrhyth-
mias, and renal failure. 
MSCs are bestowed with the property of not exhibiting ACE2. In addition, Z. 
Leng et al. have shown the absence of TMPRSS2 in MSC through single-cell 
transcriptome analysis [38]. By naturally lacking the key entry points, MSCs are 
immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
8. Clinical Trials on MSCs and nCOVID-19 
A multicentric trial by Beijing 302 hospital (Trial no: NCT04252118) is expected 
to recruit 20 patients to evaluate the safety and functional outcome of umbilical 
cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy (UC-MSCs) for patients with nCOVID-19 
pneumonia.  A  group  of  10  patients  will  receive  3  intravenous  infusion  of 
UC-MSCs along with the conventional treatment and remaining 10 patients will 
receive only conventional treatment. The clinical, immunological, pulmonary 
functional and radiological outcomes will be evaluated during 180 days follow 
up period. The phase I trial researchers expected the potential beneficial effect of 
MSC based treatment could be principally due to the immunomodulation and 
regenerative potential of pulmonary parenchymal cells [48]. 
A  clinical  trial  was  started  by  Wuhan  Union  Hospital  (Trial  no: 
NCT04273646) to investigate effectiveness and safety of UC-MSCs in treating 
nCOVID-19 severe pneumonia patients. They recruited 48 patients, with 24 pa-
tients receiving 4 IV transfusion of 5.0 × 106 cells/kg of UC-MSCs along with 
conventional treatment. Another 24 patients receiving conventional treatment 
(in the form of supportive treatment) will serve as a control group. Based on 
their study protocol the patients will be followed up from 90 days to 96 weeks. 
These researchers proclaimed that UC-MSCs migrate to damaged tissues and 
exert strong anti-inflammatory & immunomodulatory functions to promote the 
repair, regeneration and rejuvenation and to resist necro-apoptosis and fibrosis 
of damaged pulmonary parenchymal tissues [49]. 
A clinical trial was started by the Puren Hospital (Trial no: NCT04293692) af-
filiated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology to explore the safety 
and efficacy of UC-MSCs therapy for coronavirus pneumonia patients. The re-
searchers recruited 48 patients with 24 patients (study group) receiving 0.5 × 106 
UC-MSCs /kg body weight IV treatment 4 times every alternate day along with 
conventional treatment and the other 24 patients (control group) receiving the

conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. In this ongoing 
trial, the efficacy of UC-MSCs will be evaluated within 24 hours and at 1, 2, 4, 8 
weeks after treatment in terms of haematological and radiological improvement 
along with 28-days mortality of the patient [50]. The end results of this trial are 
yet to be published. 
9. Discussion 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have self-renewal and multi-differential abili-
ties. They are readily accessible and expandable in-vitro with exceptional ge-
nomic stability and few ethical issues, marking its importance in cellular therapy, 
regenerative medicine and tissue rejuvenation and repairment [51]. Tsai MS et 
al. reported immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities of mesen-
chymal stem cells [52]. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are triggered by 
the activation of toll like receptor in MSCs [53] [54]. Few pilot studies by Leng Z 
et al. [38] and Liang B et al. [55], using MSCs have produced promising outcome 
for patients reported positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. By utilizing its re-
parative and immunomodulatory characteristics rightly, it can be a reliable 
therapeutic strategy, notably in the nCOVID-19 pandemic. 
MSCs exert antimicrobial effect indirectly through coordination of the pro- 
and anti-inflammatory elements of the immune system or by increasing the 
phagocytotic activity in the microenvironment; and directly by the secretion of 
antimicrobial peptides & proteins (AMPs), and by the expression of molecules 
such  as  indoleamine  2,3-dioxygenase  (IDO)  and  interleukin  (IL)-17  [56]. 
AMPs-mediated cell killing occur by disrupting membrane integrity, by inhibit-
ing protein, DNA or RNA synthesis, and by interacting with certain intracellular 
targets. Thus, MSC helps in curbing the microbial agent [57] [58]. 
Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy inhibit the exaggerated response of 
the immune system and promotes, regenerates and rejuvenates the microenvi-
ronment. After entering the systemic circulation, MSCs invade the lung paren-
chyma and exerts its action by improving the pulmonary micro alveolar struc-
ture and pulmonary compliance which further prevents pulmonary fibrosis [59]. 
After administration of IV MSCs, due to its immunosuppressive potential, there 
is a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and induc-
tion of regulatory dendritic cells to the repaired tissue. The increased levels of 
IL-10 and VEGF promoted the pulmonary parenchymal repair and rejuvenation, 
which  lead  to  the  clinical  and  functional  recovery  of  patients  with  severe 
nCOVID-19 pneumonia [60] [61]. 
Leng et al. (2020) conducted a pilot clinical study on MSC transplantation for 
7 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, among them one critically severe, four severe, 
and two non-severe. 1 × 106 clinical-grade MSCs per kilogram of weight was 
given as an intravenous dose to all the 7 patients. Extensive follow up on various 
parameters including pulmonary function, peripheral lymphocytes, and C-reactive 
proteins along with screening for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, continued until 14

days after transplantation. The treatment significantly improved the health con-
dition of the patients. Also the study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was not infecting 
MSCs. In nCOVID-19 affected individuals, MSCs downregulates the inflamma-
tory response and promote tissue repair and regeneration [38]. 
Liang et al. (2020) treated a critically ill 65-year-old patient with allogeneic 
human  umbilical  cord  MSC  (hUCMSC).  Three  intravenous  infusions  of 
hUCMSC significantly improved the patient’s condition. It was evident even af-
ter the first infusion of 5 × 107 hUCMSC, with no side effects reported [55]. 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), as a therapeutic option for nCOVID-19 af-
fected individuals, can help in improving the lung compliance, curb off pneu-
monia and the agent factor causing the disease per se. The choice of mesenchy-
mal stem cells has to be validated. Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells 
(UC-MSCs) being allogenic and with limited availability, the option of autolo-
gous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs) and Adipose derived 
Mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs), which are easily accessible in larger quan-
tities as well as autologous in nature eliminating immunological concerns, can 
serve the purpose of regenerating pulmonary micro alveolar epithelium and 
meshwork, thus decreasing morbidity & mortality and improving the functional 
quality of life of nCOVID-19 affected individuals. 
The  evidence  on  Mesenchymal  stem  cell  as  a  therapeutic  option  for 
nCOVID-19 patients is limited; more clinical trials have to be taken up with 
ethical consideration to prove the efficacy and safety of MSCs in combating 
nCOVID-19. Also, long term follow-up is required to validate the results and to 
prove the long term risk-benefits of MSCs on nCOVID-19 affected individuals. 
10. Conclusion 
To summarise, this review focuses on the MSCs as a novel therapeutic option in 
managing nCOVID-19 infected patients with severe pneumonia considering its 
safety and efficacy. The novel cellular therapy against severe novel coronavirus 
infection (nCOVID-19) renders autologous or allogenic MSCs as a therapeutic 
option to regulate inflammatory response, maintain functional alveoli microen-
vironment, promote endogenous regeneration and repair, and natural resistance 
against it with no or minimal side-effects (as shown in Figure 2). To emphasize, 
MSCs through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory potential inhibit 
the overactivation of immune system and play a vital role in regeneration of the 
affected tissues, thus enhancing recovery. To add on, this therapeutic option of 
treating critically ill nCOVID-19 patients with MSCs is relatively non-invasive 
and inexpensive. Further studies are required in larger cohort to validate this 
modality of treatment.
