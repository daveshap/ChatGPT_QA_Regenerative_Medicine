1. Introduction 
Several types of wound dressings composed of collagen (Col) have been devel-
oped and used in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery [1] [2] [3]. One 
of the excellent wound dressings is the sheet-shaped collagen sponge with a si-
licone film attached to the top surface [4]. This wound dressing is manufac-
tured by freeze-vacuum drying a mixed aqueous solution of fibrous Col and 
heat-denatured collagen (Col’), followed by thermal dehydration to introduce 
intermolecular crosslinks between collagen molecules. Fibrous Col is prepared 
by neutralizing an acidic Col aqueous solution with phosphate buffer. The fibr-
ous Col in the sponge serves as a scaffold for new tissue formation. The Col’ in 
the sponge acts as a wound healing promoter. In the treatment of severe burns, 
this wound dressing is applied to deep tissue defect wounds after excision of ne-
crotic tissue. Under good conditions, blood vessels and fibroblasts invade the in-
side of the sponge from the surrounding dermis to form granulation tissue. The 
treatment with this wound dressing can form excellent transplant beds for auto-
logous split-thickness skin grafts. The function of fibrous Col as a scaffold is 
considered to be important for extensive and deep tissue defect wounds. 
Wound dressings are also needed in the field of oral surgery. The sheet-shaped 
collagen sponge with the same composition as the wound dressing described 
above was developed. The treatments in oral surgery using this collagen sponge 
were reported [5] [6] [7] [8]. Some properties to be improved have been pointed 
out for this collagen sponge. In the treatment of root surface exposure due to 
gingival degeneracy and loss of attached gingiva, mucosal fragments are col-
lected from palatal mucosa and then transplanted to gingival defect wounds. The 
sheet-shaped collagen sponge can be applied to mucosal defect wounds caused 
by collecting mucosal fragments. Under good conditions, blood vessels and mu-
cosal fibroblasts invade the inside of the sponge from the surrounding mucosa to 
form granulation tissue. At the same time as this process, the surrounding mu-
cosal epithelium divides, proliferates, and moves on this granulation tissue to 
form epidermis. Since the area of mucosal defect wounds is small, it is possible 
to form epidermis from the surroundings. Alternatively, the sheet-shaped colla-
gen sponge can be applied to gingival defect wounds. Under good conditions, 
blood vessels and gingival fibroblasts invade the inside of the sponge from the 
surrounding gingiva to form granulation tissue. At the same time as this process, 
the surrounding gingival epithelium divides, proliferates, and moves on this 
granulation tissue to form epidermis. Since the area of gingival defect wounds is 
small, it is possible to form epidermis from the surroundings. Basically, the

treatment of small and shallow tissue defect wounds in the oral cavity is different 
from the treatment of extensive and deep tissue defect wounds in burn injury. 
Therefore, a new design suitable for collagen sponge used in oral surgery is 
needed. 
In addition, the collagen sponge devise is also needed for the treatment of 
tooth extraction sockets. The cylindrical collagen sponge with the same compo-
sition as the wound dressing described above was developed. The treatments of 
tooth extraction socket using this cylindrical sponge were reported [9] [10]. In 
this case as well, some properties to be improved have been pointed out for this 
collagen sponge. In the normal wound healing process, blood clots form in the 
tooth extraction socket. Blood vessels and gingival fibroblasts invade the inside 
of the blood clot to form granulation tissue. At the same time as this process, the 
surrounding gingival epithelium divides, proliferates, and moves on this granu-
lation tissue to form epidermis. Under good conditions, osteoblasts emerge in-
side the granulation tissue and alveolar bone regenerates. Since the space of the 
tooth extraction socket is small, it is important to maintain the space for cell mi-
gration in the sponge combined with blood clot. As a basic design, the sheet- 
shaped sponge and the cylindrical sponge should be biodegraded and absorbed 
by the time new tissue formation is completed. 
In our previous study, the wound dressing composed of hyaluronic acid and 
Col was developed [11] [12] [13] [14]. Hyaluronic acid has an excellent wound 
healing promoting function, but has a poor hemostatic function [15] [16]. The 
sponge devices used in the field of oral surgery need to have a hemostatic effect, 
because it is not easy to stop bleeding in the oral cavity. Therefore, this study 
focused on the design of sponge devices composed of Col. It is well known that 
Col is an important biomaterial for wound healing as it has various biological 
activities [17]. In addition, Col has an excellent hemostatic function [18]. Col 
molecules are considered to have a better wound healing function in the non- 
fibrous state than in the fibrous state [19]. From this point of view, we designed 
the sponge devices composed of non-fibrous Col and Col’. The purpose of this 
study is to develop various types of collagen sponge devices used in the field of 
oral surgery. The targets are the sheet-shaped sponges to cover mucosal defect 
wounds (product-1) and gingival defect wounds (product-2) and the cylindrical 
sponge to fill tooth extraction sockets (product-3). 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Manufacture of Sheet-Shaped Sponge to Cover Mucosal   
and Gingival Defect Wounds 
Purified granular collagen (Col) derived from porcine skin was purchased from 
Nippon Meat Packers (Osaka, Japan). Terror peptides of collagen molecule that 
are antigenic determinants have been removed by enzyme degradation. Col (21.6 
g) was dissolved in distilled water (1800 mL) under stirring with a screw propel-
ler below 25˚C overnight to obtain Col aqueous solution (1.2 w/v%, pH 2.8).

Aside from this, Col (21.6 g) was dissolved in distilled water (1800 mL) under 
stirring with a screw propeller below 25˚C overnight and then heated at 60˚C for 
1 hour to obtain heat-denatured collagen aqueous solution (1.2 w/v%, pH 2.8). 
This heat-denatured collagen is referred to as Col’. The Col aqueous solution 
was mixed with the Col’ aqueous solution by stirring and then adjusted to the 
conditions of pH 4.5 by dropping sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to obtain 
a clear mixture. 
First, the Col aqueous solution (800 ml) was mixed with the Col’ aqueous so-
lution (400 mL). This mixture (2 mL) was poured into each of the 10 partitions 
(18 mm × 18 mm) of a plastic tray and refrigerated at 4˚C for 6 hours or more, 
and then was frozen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum drying 
to obtain the sheet-shaped sponge. This sheet-shaped sponge was named as 
Sponge-CC’21. The composition ratio of Col and Col’ is 2/1. Second, the Col 
aqueous solution (600 mL) was mixed with the Col’ aqueous solution (600 mL). 
The sheet-shaped sponge was manufactured in a similar way. This sponge was 
named as Sponge-CC’11. The composition ratio of Col and Col’ is 1/1. Finally, 
the Col aqueous solution (400 ml) was mixed with the Col’ aqueous solution 
(800 mL). The sheet-shaped sponge was manufactured in a similar way. This 
sponge was named as Sponge-CC’12. The composition ratio of Col and Col’ is 
1/2. 
Both surfaces of the sheet-shaped sponge were irradiated using a 15 W ultra-
violet lamp with a wavelength of 253.7 nm at a distance of 20 cm to introduce 
intermolecular crosslinks between collagen molecules. Both surfaces of Sponge- 
CC’21 were treated by UV irradiation for 5, 10, 15 minutes. They were named as 
Sponge-CC’21-5x2, Sponge-CC’21-10x2 and Sponge-CC’21-15x2, respectively. 
Both surfaces of Sponge-CC’11 were treated by UV irradiation for 5, 10, 15 mi-
nutes. They were named as Sponge-CC’11-5x2, Sponge-CC’11-10x2 and Sponge- 
CC’11-15x2, respectively. Both surfaces of Sponge-CC’12 were treated by UV ir-
radiation for 5, 10, 15 minutes. They were named as Sponge-CC’12-5x2, Sponge- 
CC’12-10x2 and Sponge-CC’12-15x2, respectively. 
2.2. Manufacture of Cylindrical Sponge to Fill Tooth   
Extraction Sockets 
The cylindrical sponge was manufactured in the same way as the sheet-shaped 
sponge. Col (8.0 g) was dissolved in distilled water (400 mL) to obtain Col aqueous 
solution (2.0 w/v%, pH 2.8). Aside from this, Col (4.0 g) was dissolved in distill-
ed water (200 mL) and then heated at 60˚C for 1 hour to obtain Col’ aqueous 
solution (2.0 w/v%, pH 2.8). The Col aqueous solution was mixed with the Col’ 
aqueous solution by stirring and then adjusted to the conditions of pH 4.5 by 
dropping sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to obtain a clear mixture. This 
mixture (2 mL) was poured into each of the cylindrical shaped plastic bottle with 
a diameter of 10 mm and a depth of 30 mm and refrigerated at 4˚C for 6 hours 
or more, and then was frozen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum

drying to obtain the cylindrical sponge. This sponge was named as cy-Sponge- 
CC’21. The composition ratio of Col and Col’ is 2/1. Both sides of the cylindrical 
sponge were treated by UV irradiation for 15 minutes. This sponge was named 
as cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2.  
2.3. Water Absorption of Sponge when Immersed in Water 
The water absorption of each sheet-shaped sponge was measured by immersing 
10 sheet-shaped sponges in a plastic container filled with distilled water (200 
mL) at 37˚C. After 10 minutes, the hydrated sponges were collected using a 
10-mesh size stainless steel mesh and then placed on this mesh for 30 minutes to 
remove excess water and then weighed. The weight of 10 hydrated sponges was 
measured and compared with the original weight before immersion in water. 
Each experiment was performed using 8 containers. The average value was cal-
culated by measuring the weight of the hydrated 10 sponges collected from each 
container. In a similar way, the water absorption of the cylindrical sponge was 
measured by immersing 5 cylindrical sponges in a plastic container filled with 
distilled water (200 mL) at 37˚C. After 10 minutes, the hydrated sponges were 
collected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh and then placed on this mesh 
for 30 minutes to remove excess water and then weighed. The weight of 5 hy-
drated sponges was measured and compared with the original weight before 
immersion in water. This experiment was performed using 8 containers. The 
average value was calculated by measuring the weight of the hydrated 5 sponges 
collected from each container. 
2.4. Weight Change of Sheet-Shaped Sponge when   
Immersed in Water 
The weight change of sheet-shaped sponge was measured by immersing 10 
sheet-shaped sponges in a plastic container filled with distilled water (200 mL) 
and placing it in an incubator at 37˚C for a predetermined time. The hydrated 10 
sponges were collected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh after immersion 
in water for 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days and 
then returned to a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm). These hydrated sponges were 
frozen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum drying to obtain dry 
sponges. The weight of 10 dry sponges was measured and compared with the 
original weight before immersion in water. Each experiment was performed us-
ing 8 containers. The average value was calculated by measuring the weight of 10 
dry sponges collected from each container. 
2.5. Weight Change of Cylindrical Sponge when Immersed   
in Water 
The weight change of cylindrical sponge was measured by immersing 5 cylin-
drical sponges in a plastic container filled with distilled water (200 mL) and 
placing it in an incubator at 37˚C for a predetermined time. The hydrated 5

sponges were collected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh after immersion 
in water for 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days and then returned 
to a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm). These hydrated sponges were frozen at 
−85˚C overnight, and followed by freeze-vacuum drying to obtain dry sponges. 
The weight of 5 dry sponges was measured and compared with the original 
weight before immersion in water. This experiment was performed using 4 con-
tainers. The average value was calculated by measuring the weight of 5 dry 
sponges collected from each container. 
2.6. Enzymatic Degradation of Sponge by Collagenase 
Collagenase powder was purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Cor-
poration (Osaka, Japan). The enzymatic degradation of sheet-shaped sponge by 
collagenase was investigated using Sponge-CC’21-15x2, Sponge-CC’11-15x2 and 
Sponge-CC’12-15x2 as typical samples. Collagenase (32 mg) was dissolved in 
distilled water (1600 mL). The enzyme concentration was adjusted to 0.002 
w/v%. The weight change of each sheet-shaped sponge was measured by im-
mersing 10 sheet-shaped sponges in each plastic container filled with distilled 
water containing collagenase (200 mL) and placing it in an incubator at 37˚C. 
The hydrated sponges were collected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh 
after immersion for 1 day and then returned to a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm). 
These hydrated sponges were frozen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze- 
vacuum drying to obtain dry sponges. The weight of 10 dry sponges was meas-
ured and compared with the original weight. Each experiment was performed 
using 8 containers. The average value was calculated by measuring the weight of 
10 dry sponges collected from each container. 
In addition, the enzymatic degradation of cylindrical sponge by collagenase 
was measured using cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 in a similar way. The weight change 
of this cylindrical sponge was measured by immersing 5 cylindrical sponges in 
each container filled with distilled water containing collagenase (200 mL) and 
placing it in an incubator at 37˚C. The hydrated sponges were collected using a 
10-mesh size stainless steel mesh after immersion for 1 day and then returned to 
a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm). These hydrated sponges were frozen at −85˚C 
overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum drying to obtain dry sponges. The 
weight of 5 dry sponges was measured and compared with the original weight. 
This experiment was performed using 8 containers. The average value was 
calculated by measuring the weight of 5 dry sponges collected from each con-
tainer. 
2.7. Statistical Evaluation 
Data were expressed as means ± standard error. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Student’s t-test for comparison between two groups. Each experi-
ment was performed 8 times to examine statistically significant differences in the 
measured values (n = 8).

3. Result 
3.1. Manufacture of Sheet-Shaped Sponge to Cover   
Mucosal and Gingival Defect Wounds 
As a preliminary experiment, the change in viscosity of Col aqueous solution 
due to temperature change was measured. Col dissolves in water under acidic 
conditions of pH 3 or less. However, precipitation occurs when pH value reaches 
4 or higher under 25˚C conditions. Such a phenomenon can be considered as 
follows. The positively charged state of the side chains of Col molecules weakens 
at pH 4 or higher. As a result, it is thought that the binding force between the 
side chains of the Col molecules and the surrounding water molecules is wea-
kened. Such conditions promote lateral alignment between rod-shaped Col mo-
lecules having a triple helical structure, thereby causing aggregation and precipi-
tation. Once the acidic Col aqueous solution is heated to 40˚C or higher, Col 
molecules undergo a conformational change from triple helical structure to 
random structure. This phenomenon reflects a decrease in viscosity. The viscos-
ity of Col aqueous solution was measured at the range from 20˚C to 60˚C using a 
standard viscometer. This viscometer rotates the cylindrical part in the solution 
and measures the rotating top surface resistance. The results of preliminary ex-
periments showed that the viscosity of Col aqueous solution (1.2 w/v%) was 
10.0, 9.2, 0.1 and 0.1 dPa·s at 20˚C, 30˚C, 40˚C and 60˚C, respectively. Once the 
Col aqueous solution was heated to 60˚C and then cooled to 20˚C, the viscosity 
was 0.4 dPa·s (Figure 1). This phenomenon indicates that the random structure 
does not return to the original helical structure. Such conditions inhibit lateral 
alignment between random-shaped molecules due to mutual steric hindrance. 
As a result, this heat-denatured Col’ aqueous solution does not precipitate even  
 
 
Figure 1. Change in viscosity of Col aqueous solution due to temper-
ature change: 1) Significant decrease in viscosity due to temperature 
change from 30˚C to 40˚C, indicating conformational change from 
triple helical structure to random structure. 2) No increase in viscosity 
due to temperature change from 60˚C to 20˚C, indicating no confor-
mational change from random structure to triple helical structure.

in the neutral pH range. The mixed aqueous solution of Col and Col’ with a 
composition ratio of 1/2 causes partial precipitation at pH 5.5 or higher. The 
mixed aqueous solution of Col and Col’ with a composition ratio of 1/1 or 2/1 
causes partial precipitation at pH 5.0 or higher. For this reason, the pH of these 
mixed aqueous solutions was set to 4.5 to obtain a clear mixture.  
The sheet-shaped sponges were manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying this 
clear mixed aqueous solution of Col and Col’ under the condition of 1.2 w/v% 
collagen concentration at pH 4.5. The both surfaces of sheet-shaped sponge were 
irradiated by UV lamp to introduce crosslinks between collagen molecules. 
Sponge-CC’21 and Sponge-CC’11 are very soft and are suitable for application to 
soft mucosal and gingival defect wounds. On the other hand, Sponge-CC’12 is 
harder than other two sponges and is not suitable for application to soft mucosal 
and gingival defect wounds. The sheet-shaped sponge has a size of 17 mm × 17 
mm and a thickness of 3 mm (Figure 2(a)). 
3.2. Manufacture of Cylindrical Sponge to Fill Tooth   
Extraction Sockets 
The cylindrical sponge was manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying the mixed 
aqueous solution of Col and Col’ under the condition of 2.0 w/v% collagen con-
centration at pH 4.5. The cylindrical sponge shrank slightly after freeze-vacuum 
drying. The sponge could be easily removed from the cylindrical shaped plastic 
bottle container. This cy-Sponge-CC’21 showed sufficient physical properties to 
be used as filler for tooth extraction sockets. A small mark was placed on one 
part of the cylindrical sponge and then UV irradiation was performed on both 
sides to introduce crosslinks between collagen molecules. The cylindrical sponge 
has a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 25 mm (Figure 2(b)). The diameter of

the cylindrical sponge is matched to the diameter of tooth extraction socket. 
This sponge is inserted into the tooth extraction socket and compressed to 
match both size. 
3.3. Water Absorption of Sponge when Immersed in Water 
It is important that the sponge has high water absorption properties. It is a great 
merit to be able to absorb a large amount of exudates containing various cell 
growth factors. For this reason, the water absorption properties of collagen 
sponges were examined. Sheet-shaped sponges showed high water absorption 
when immersed in water at 37˚C for 10 minutes (Figure 3). Sponge-CC’12-15x2 
absorbed 45 times more water than its own weight. Sponge-CC’11-15x2 ab-
sorbed 48 times more water than its own weight. Sponge-CC’21-15x2 absorbed 
46 times more water than its own weight. On the other hand, cy-Sponge-CC’21- 
15x2 absorbed 30 times more water than its own weight. The sheet-shaped 
sponge was manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying the collagen aqueous solu-
tion at the concentration of 1.2 w/v%. On the contrary, the cylindrical sponge 
was manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying the collagen aqueous solution at the 
concentration of 2.0 w/v%. The cylindrical sponge has a denser structure than 
the sheet-shaped sponge. As a result, cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 showed a lower 
water absorption value than Sponge-CC’21-15x2.  
3.4. Weight Change of Sheet-Shaped Sponge when   
Immersed in Water 
It is important that collagen sponge is biodegraded and absorbed by the time

new tissue formation is completed. The weight change of the sponge when im-
mersed in water is related to the degree of crosslinks between collagen mole-
cules. The degree of crosslinks is related to UV irradiation time. For this reason, 
the weight changes of collagen sponges treated by different UV irradiation times 
were examined. The weight change of the sheet-shaped sponge was measured by 
immersing 10 sheet-shaped sponges in water at 37˚C (Figure 4(a)). The weight 
change rate of Sponge-CC’12 when immersed in water was measured. The weight 
change rate of Sponge-CC’12-15x2 was 70% of the original weight when im-
mersed in water for 7 days. On the contrary, the weight change rate of Sponge- 
CC’12-5x2 was 32% of the original weight when immersed in water for 3 days 
(Figure 5). Next, the weight change of Sponge-CC’11 when immersed in water 
was measured. The weight change rate of Sponge-CC’11-15x2 was 71% of the 
original weight when immersed in water for 7 days. On the contrary, the weigh 
change rate of Sponge-CC’11-5x2 was 25% of the original weight when im-
mersed in water for 3 days (Figure 6). Next, the weight change of Sponge-CC’21 
when immersed in water was measured. The weight change rate of Sponge- 
CC’21-15x2 was 76% of the original weight when immersed in water for 7 days. 
On the contrary, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-5x2 was 51% of the 
original weight when immersed in water for 3 days (Figure 7). These results in-
dicate that the degree of crosslinks between collagen molecules depends on the 
UV irradiation time.  
The degree of crosslinks between collagen molecules also depended on the 
composition ratio of Col and Col’. The intermolecular crosslinks was inadequate 
under the condition of UV irradiation time of 5 minutes, and increased in the

CC’11-10x2, Sponge-CC’12-10x2, and Sponge-CC’21-10x2 (Figure 9). There 
was a slight difference in weight change among 3 groups due to sufficient inter-
molecular crosslinks when UV irradiation time was 15 minutes (Figure 10).

3.6. Enzymatic Degradation of Sponge by Collagenase 
It is important that collagen sponge is biodegraded and absorbed by the time 
new tissue formation is completed. As an in vitro experiment, the enzymatic de-
gradation properties of sponge by collagenase were investigated. The enzymatic

degradation of sheet-shaped sponge and cylindrical sponge was determined 
(Figure 12). As a result of comparative experiment, the weight change rate of 
Sponge-CC’12-15x2, Sponge-CC’11-15x2 and Sponge-CC’21-15x2 when im-
mersed in water for 1 day was 79%, 79% and 80% of the original weight, respec-
tively. The weight change rate of Sponge-CC’12-15x2, Sponge-CC’11-15x2 and

w/v%) for 1 day was 70%, 77% and 77% of the original weight, respectively. This 
result suggests that the crosslinks between collagen molecules in these sheet- 
shaped sponges can effectively delay enzymatic degradation by collagenase. In 
addition, the weight change rate of cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 when immersed in 
water for 1 day was 44% of the original weight. On the other hand, the weight 
change rate of cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 when immersed in water containing col-
lagenase (0.002 w/v%) was 34% of the original weight. This result suggests that 
the crosslinks between collagen molecules in this cylindrical sponge also can ef-
fectively delay enzymatic degradation by collagenase. It is expected that collagen 
sponge is biodegraded and absorbed by the time new tissue formation is com-
pleted. 
4. Discussion   
What should be emphasized is the following. Basically, the treatment of small 
and shallow tissue defect wounds in the oral cavity is different from the treat-
ment of extensive and deep tissue defect wounds in burn injury. In the former 
healing process, the function of non-fibrous Col as providing space for cell mi-
gration is considered to be important. In the later healing process, the function 
of fibrous Col as a scaffold is considered to be important. Therefore, a new de-
sign suitable for collagen sponge used in oral surgery is needed. 
This study focused on the following two ideas. The first important idea in the 
manufacturing process is how to prepare a clear mixed aqueous solution of Col 
and Col’. The second important idea in the manufacturing process is how to 
control the crosslinks between collagen molecules. The general method for in-
troducing crosslinks between collagen molecules is to use chemical cross-linking 
agents. This method requires the removal of unreacted cross-linking agents. This 
process is disadvantageous in manufacturing products. One practical method is 
the introducing crosslinks by thermal dehydration in a vacuum at 110˚C for 
several hours. Another practical method is the introducing crosslinks by UV ir-
radiation. We adopted the method of introducing crosslinks by UV irradiation. 
This method has the advantage that the degree of crosslinks can be controlled 
arbitrarily. 
In this study, we investigated the optimum composition ratio of Col and Col’ 
and the optimum conditions for introducing crosslinks between collagen mole-
cules. We examined the weight change of sheet-shaped sponges when immersed 
in water. As typical comparison data, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’- 
21-15x2 when immersed in water for 3 days and 7 days were 80% and 76% of the 
original weight before immersion in water. On the other hand, the weight 
change rate of Sponge-CC’21-5x2 when immersed in water for 3 days was 51% 
of the original weight before immersion in water. It is considered that Sponge- 
CC’21-15x2 was cross-linked sufficiently in the outer layer but insufficiently in 
the intermediate layer of the sponge, whereas Sponge-CC’21-5x2 was cross- 
linked insufficiently in both outer layer and intermediate layer of the sponge.

The sheet-shaped sponge for covering mucosal defect wounds (product-1) 
and the sheet-shaped sponge for covering gingival defect wounds (product-2) 
require different properties. The product-1 needs to protect mucosal defect 
wounds for at least two weeks. Sponge-CC’21-15x2 is the top candidate for 
product-1, since it has very slow elution properties. The product-2 is inserted in-
side the incised gingiva. It is desirable to be mostly biodegraded and absorbed 
within a week. Sponge-CC’21-5x2 is the top candidate for product-2, since it has 
slightly fast elution properties.  
The tooth extraction sockets have less exudate than mucosal and gingival de-
fect wounds. The filler for extraction socket is desirable to be mostly biodegraded 
and absorbed within two weeks. It is considered that cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 has 
a unique structure. The collagen molecules in the outer layer were sufficiently 
cross-linked, whereas the collagen molecules in the central part were insuffi-
ciently cross-linked. When immersed in water, some molecules in the central 
part quickly dissolve into water and then gradually dissolve into water. It is ex-
pected that a sustained outflow of collagen molecules from the sponge can create 
an environment for cell migration. The cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 is a good candi-
date for product-3, since it has initially fast elution properties and subsequent 
very slow elution properties. 
When  the  sheet-shaped  sponge  (product-1  and  product-2)  or  cylindrical 
sponge (product-3) is applied to wounds, it is considered that the internal insuf-
ficiently cross-linked collagen molecules elute first, and then the external suffi-
ciently cross-linked collagen molecules elute with the collapse of the reticulated 
structure due to enzymatic degradation. Such a sustained outflow of collagen 
molecules from the sponge creates an environment that promotes cell migration 
(Figure 13). One of the factors that create such an environment is a physical 
effect of voids created by elution of collagen molecules from the sponge. Anoth-
er is a biological effect that eluted collagen molecules act as chemotactic factors 
to attract surrounding fibroblasts to the wound site. As a basic design, the 
sheet-shaped sponge and the cylindrical sponge should be biodegraded and ab-
sorbed by the time new tissue formation is completed. 
In addition to the above two manufacturing ideas, there is a practical idea for 
clinical use. As mentioned above, the excellent wound dressing is a collagen 
sponge with a silicone film attached to the top surface [4]. In the treatment of 
severe burns, this wound dressing is attached to necrotic tissue excision wounds, 
and fixed easily with a normal bandage. In the treatment of oral mucosal and 
gingival defect wounds, such a wound dressing must be secured by suturing the 
perimeter. Actually, it is difficult to prevent infection from the sutured part. To 
solve this shortcoming, we propose a new fixing method using a tissue adhesive. 
In our previous study, it was demonstrated that PMMA-based tissue adhesive 
has moderate viscosity and instant adhesiveness, and is effective in closing skin 
incisions [20]. This tissue adhesive is a product for oral surgery. An effective 
method is possible by using collagen sponge and PMMA-based tissue adhesive

together. A sheet-shaped sponge is attached to mucosal and gingival defect 
wounds, and then PMMA-based tissue adhesive is coated on it to fix it. Covering 
the outer surface and surroundings of the sheet-shaped sponge with this tissue 
adhesive  has  the  advantage  of  preventing  infection.  Similarly,  a  cylindrical 
sponge is filled into tooth extraction socket, and then PMMA-based tissue adhe-
sive is coated on it to fix it. Covering the top of the cylindrical sponge with this 
tissue adhesive has the advantage of preventing infection.  
Comprehensively, it is important to consider technological progress and prac-
ticality. Tissue-engineering products composed of cells and biomaterials have 
been developed for root coverage [21] [22]. In our previous study, autologous 
cultured gingival dermis substitute composed of gingival fibroblasts and matrix 
has been developed [23]. This autologous cultured product was demonstrated to 
be a beneficial grafting material for root coverage in the treatment of gingival 
recession. This tissue-engineered product has excellent performance but is not 
practical due to high manufacturing cost and long manufacturing time. On the 
contrary, the sheet-shaped collagen sponge developed in this study is more prac-
tical due to its high performance and low manufacturing cost. This sheet-shaped 
collagen sponge is practical because it can be used immediately after being taken 
out of the sterilization bag. 
5. Conclusion 
The sheet-shaped sponge and the cylindrical sponge were manufactured by 
freeze-vacuum drying the aqueous solution of Col and Col’ at a composition ra-

tio of 2/1. The both sides of sponge were treated with UV irradiation for 5, 10, 15 
minutes to introduce crosslinks between collagen molecules. As a basic design, 
the sheet-shaped sponge and the cylindrical sponge should be biodegraded and 
absorbed by the time new tissue formation is completed. Sponge-CC’21-10x2 is 
the top candidate for the mucosal wound dressing. Sponge-CC’21-5x2 is the top 
candidate for the gingival wound dressing. In addition, cy-Sponge-CC’21-15x2 is 
a good candidate for the tooth extraction socket filler.
