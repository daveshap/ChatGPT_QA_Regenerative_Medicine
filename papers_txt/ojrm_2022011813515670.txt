Nppa-CreER; Rosa26 tdTomato mouse was examined during embryonic (E10.5 
- E18.5) and postnatal (P0, P3, P5, P7, P14, P28, P8w) stage. Immunofluores-
cence results revealed that Nppa-positive cells labeled TNNI3-positive cardi-
omyocytes and protruded into the atrial cavity at the beginning of E11.5 - 
E12.0 and during subsequent development to form Nppa-positive myocardial 
trabeculae. Thick comb-shaped myocardium was observed after birth, and we 
suspect that this was particularly important for the normal contractile activity 
and pumping function of the atrium. Additionally, non-single origin of Nppa- 
positive trabecular myocardiocytes were revealed through Tamoxifen-induced 
lineage tracing experiment. Our findings reveal proliferation dynamics and 
non-comprehensive fate decisions of cardiomyocytes that produce the distinct 
architecture of the atrium chamber.

1. Introduction 
Cells continuously differentiate, multiply, and specialize into cells and structures 
during the early development of the heart, with different functions and finally 
form a four-chambered heart with atria and ventricles [1]. The abnormal forma-
tion of structures or structure remodeling in this process due to various reasons 
may lead to congenital heart disease such as atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to reveal the normal process of the heart developing into four ordinary 
chambers, which includes the cell fate and molecular mechanism of the cham-
bers. This article focuses on the fate of atrial cardiomyocytes. 
As the first organ to form and function during embryonic development, the 
heart has gone through the heart tube from the beginning, the stage of looping 
to the final stage of septum formation. The whole process is also affected by mo-
lecular mechanism regulation and intro-environmental factors. In the past few 
years, scientists have used various lineage tracing strategies to study the fate of 
precursor cells or progenitor cells in the early stages of heart development [2] [3] 
[4]. 
On the eighth day of embryonic heart development, the atria are formed by the 
heart mesoderm at the posterior site and the ventricles are formed by the cranial 
heart mesoderm. There have been numerous reports on some fundamental dif-
ferences between atria and ventricles [1] [5] [6]. In particular, humans know 
more about the morphogenesis of the ventricle [7] [8], but how the atrial cham-
ber is built has not been explored at a comparable level. Here, we used a Nppa- 
CreER mouse line for inducible lineage tracing. Our instant lineage tracing ap-
proach identifies Nppa-expressing cardiomyocytes that are labeled during ta-
moxifen treatment. We first revealed the specific pattern of Nppa-positive car-
diomyocytes during morphogenesis of atrial myocardium, which may give im-
petus to understand the cellular mechanism of atrial development to explore the 
causes of common congenital arrhythmia heart diseases. 
2. Results 
Morphology of myocardium revealed by Nppa spatial-temporal expres-
sion 
We used the Nppa-GFP knock-in mouse line where Nppa was a specific mo-
lecular marker for atrial myocardium and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
worked as a surrogate for endogenous Nppa expression [8] [9]. 
E10.5. The stereo fluorescence image showed that green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) was expressed on the outer wall of the atrium edge, and the fluorescence 
intensity was weak. The immunofluorescence image revealed that the left and 
right atriums of the embryonic heart were formed during this period, and the 
thinnest part of the atrium wall was only one cell thick. The thicker part con-
tained 2 - 3 cells. The cardiomyocytes have not yet invaded the heart cavity, the 
atrial wall inner surface was relatively flat, and no myocardial trabeculae were 
detected in the cavity part (Figure 1).

E11.5. GFP immunoreactive cells (hereinafter referred to as GFP-positive cells) 
were distributed on the left and right atrium walls. The atrial wall inner surface 
was basically smooth. While at the uppermost of the right atrium cardiomyo-
cytes were protruding into the cavity. An extremely small amount of myocar-
dium existed in trabeculae. Compared to the previous period the wall of the left 
and right atrium was thicker. 3 - 4 layers of cardiomyocytes constituted of atrium 
wall and the left atrium wall was thicker than the right atrium wall with 3 - 6 
layers of cardiomyocytes (Figure 2). 
E12.0. The GFP-positive cells in the atrium wall invaded into the atrial cavity 
at the top of the right atrium and increase in number (compared to E11.5), while 
the atrial wall cavity surface of the left atrium was still relatively smooth without 
the appearance of myocardial trabeculae (Figure 3).  
E12.5. The number of GFP-positive myocardial trabecular cells in the right 
atrium continued to increase. The GFP-positive cells on the top of the left atrium 
protruded into the atrial cavity and began to form a small amount of trabecular 
myocardium (Figure 4). 
E13.5. The number of GFP-positive trabecular cardiomyocytes in the right 
atrial cavity has increased significantly and was connected to form a network

structure. Although the left atrium has not yet formed a trabecular network 
structure, there were still a small number of trabecular cardiomyocytes from the 
top and lateral sides of the atrium (Figure 5). 
E14.5. GFP principally became visible in the right atrial reticular trabecular 
myocardium. While GFP was relatively rare in the atrial wall, and the GFP- 
positive cells in the atrial wall were close to the side of the atrial cavity or close to 
the endocardium lateral distribution. The number of left atrial trabecular myo-
cardial cells was increasing (Figure 6). 
E15.5. The fluorescence intensity of GFP expressed in the left and right atria 
attained the highest level during this period. GFP-positive cardiomyocytes form 
a directional comb-shaped trabecular meshwork in the right atrium and the post-
erior cavity. The comb-shaped myocardium separated the right atrium into the 
front and rear cavities. There were fewer tangled myocardial trabeculae in the 
lateral of the atrium. In the left atrium, the myocardial trabeculae are mainly 
distributed in the lateral. At the same time, there was a small amount of trabecular 
myocardium protruding from the atrium wall into the cavity at the top (Figure 7). 
E16.5. As the development progresses, the cardiomyocytes in the top, anterior, 
central, and posterior chambers of the right atrium are connected to form a con-
tinuous network of myocardial tissue. The number of trabecular myocardial cells 
in the left atrium continued to increase and formed a small area of continuous

trabecular muscles. While only a tiny trabecular myocardium in the lateral part 
was detected, which seemed to form a pocket-sized cavity here (Figure 8). 
E17.5. GFP-positive cells almost filled the entire right atrium cavity, leaving 
only a small part of the cavity close to the midline of the atrial septum. The left 
atrium had a similar situation as there was still a narrow cavity structure in the 
lateral part (Figure 9). 
E18.5. Compared with the narrow and pointed anterior and triangular whole 
before, the shape of the right atrium was chock-full and three-dimensionally 
trapezoidal, and a continuous layer of GFP-positive myocardial trabeculae was 
formed by the atrial wall at the bottom of the atrium. Thicker myocardial tissue 
was visible as the number of left atrial trabecular myocardial cells increased. But 
the proportion of trabecular muscles did not bourgeon due to the boost in the 
volume of the entire atrium (Figure 10). 
P0. The left atrium was elongated and narrower than the right atrium. GFP- 
positive myocardial cells encircled the left and right atria in a loop or ring shape 
(Figure 11). 
P3. The trabecular muscles were interwoven into a mesh-like myocardium in 
the left and right atriums and continuously thickened. The right atrium was di-
vided into two comparable chambers located in the central and rear part and the 
front part respectively (Figure 12).

P5. The left and right atria were almost filled with GFP-positive cardiomyo-
cytes and formed a directional, thick bundle of muscle (Figure 13). 
P7. The trabecular myocardium evacuated again to form more hollow con-
structions as the cavity volume increased (Figure 14). 
P14. The trabecular myocardium was connected with surrounding cardiomyo-
cytes to form a thick bundled myocardium (Figure 15). 
P28. The fascicular myocardium of the left and right atria continues to thick-
en. The right atrium predominantly formed a larger cavity structure in the cen-
tral and rear. While irregular abundant cavities emerged in distinct areas of the 
left atrium (Figure 16). 
P8w. GFP-positive trabecular myocardium in the right atrium embosomed the 
atrial cavity based on the atrial wall and formed a cavity in the vicinity of the 
atrial septum. While the left atrium had a grander cavity in the central and post-
erior part compared to the right. There were also a few slender apertures bor-
dered by the trabecular myocardium and atrial wall (Figure 17). 
Non-single foundation origin trabecular cardiomyocytes 
To trace the fate of embryonic trabecular cardiomyocytes, we crossed Nppa- 
2A-CreER with R26-tdTomato mice and collected heart samples at different 
time points for analysis.

With the detection of tdTomato positive cells, we could trace the endogenous 
Nppa-positive cells. In the left and right atrium, we detected tdTomato positive 
cells in myocardial walls and myocardial trabeculae, which overlapped with the 
myocardial specific signal TNNI3. The fluorescent protein expression pattern of 
the right atrium was slightly different from the left atrium. The overall situation 
was that the number of tdTomato-positive cells in the right atrium was signifi-
cantly larger than that in the left atrium. However, there were also common 
points that the ratio of tdTomato-positive cells in the upper wall of the left and 
right atria to the number of cardiomyocytes was higher than the inferior wall 
(myocardial wall at the bottom of the atrium) (Figures 18-20). 
E16.5 - E17.5. As the development progressed and the volume of the atrial cav-
ity augmented, the number of tdTomato-positive cardiomyocytes continuously 
increased, restricted both in the atrial myocardial wall and myocardial trabecu-
lae; what remained unchanged was the number of tdTomato-positive myocardial 
cells in the right atrium was still significantly higher than that of the left atrium, 
and the trabecular myocardium populations in the middle, posterior and top of 
the right atrium showed significantly fewer tdTomato-positive cardiomyocytes. 
The anterior part of the left atrium and the posterior part close to the atrial sep-
tum appeared similar results. This indicated that the source of the trabecular 
myocardium protruding into the heart cavity was not a single one, or that the

trabecular myocardial cells in different parts of the atrium had different founda-
tions; However, it might also be due to the difference in the time of administra-
tion of Tamoxifen or the different induction efficiency of the individual samples 
(Figure 21). 
E18.5 - P0. The reticular trabecular myocardium and cell populations of the 
myocardial wall in the left and right atriums were all positive for tdTomato, 
which indicated that the trabecular myocardium protruded into the atrial cavity 
was derived from the early Nppa-positive cardiomyocyte population (Figure 22). 
P3, P5, P7, P14, P28, P8w. Different from the E18.5 - P0 period, for the post-
natal heart, there were considerably more tdTomato positive cells in the right 
atrium than in the left atrium, and tdTomato positive cells were mainly distri-
buted in the lateral and middle of the right atrium. Trabecular myocardium at 
the top of the atrium was less identified while the tdTomato positive cells in the 
left atrium were mainly scattered in the central but less at the anterior and post-
erior top. This phenotype was similar to that at E16.5-E17.5, which indicated 
that the source of trabecular myocardium protruded into the heart cavity was 
not a single origin (Figures 23-25). 
3. Discussion 
Arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation (AF) affecting millions of individuals 
worldwide, which is characterized by very rapid and uncoordinated atrial activi-
ty, and the process and causes of AF can be linked to trigger and substrate. Cel-
lular mechanism of atria development contributes to substrate. Tissue architec-
ture, specifically myocardial framework is the key concept underlying develop-
ment of AF. 
The spatiotemporal expression pattern of Nppa in atrial cardiomyocytes in 
this article showed a relatively complete and dynamic process of atrial develop-
ment. We used Nppa positive cardiomyocytes to trace the fate of trabeculae in 
atria, and they were represented in postnatal trabecular myocardial components. 
In addition, Nppa positive cardiomyocytes labeled at E11.0 - E12.0 protruded 
into atrial cavity and during subsequent development to form Nppa-positive myo- 
cardial architectures. Atrial wall cardiomyocytes retain contacts with laterally 
expanding muscle and these cardiomyocytes cloned to form pectinate muscle 
branches in atrial chmber. The lineage tracing of Nppa-positive cardiomyocytes 
further revealed the non-single cellular origin of the atrial myocardium. We pro-
vided reliable evidence that, with the expansion and coalescence of atrial trabe-
culae, the hybrid postnatal myocardium zone in the atrium developed. These 
data suggested that abnormalities in myocardial structure and function resulting 
from complicated diverse cell or tissue population. Precise mechanism of atrial 
pathology remains further defined. 
Recent reports indicated that the left atrial appendage was closely related to 
thrombosis and arrhythmia [10] [11]. More recent efforts have focused on iden-
tifying the underlying cellular mechanism that lead to atrial remodeling [12]. In

clinical research, advanced structural atrial remodeling has been difficult to 
process. Further mechanical studies are needed to improve understanding arr-
hythmia such as AF. In the follow-up, we may also focus on the research on the 
cellular mechanism of the development of the left and right atrial appendages, 
which is of great significance for revealing the causes of heart diseases such as 
clinical arrhythmia and hitting upon treatment strategies based on this. 
4. Methods 
1) Mice 
All Mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Jinan Univer-
sity. Mice were maintained on a C129/C57BL6/J mixed background. Both male 
and female mice were randomized in different experiment groups in this study. 
The morning of vaginal plug detection was designated as E0.5 [13]. Caesarean 
section was performed on pregnant mice receiving tamoxifen to obtain perinatal 
pups. Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648-5G) was dissolved in corn oil (20 mg/ml) and 
introduced by gavage at indicated time (0.1 - 0.16 mg per gram mouse body 
weight). Nppa-GFP mouse line was generated by homologous recombination 
using Red/ET recombineering as previously described [14]. For Nppa-GFP mouse 
lines and cDNAs-encoding DTRGFP fusion protein were inserted into frame 
with the translational start codon of the Nppa gene [15]. For Nppa-CreER allele, 
a cDNA encoding Cre recombinase fused with a mutant form of the estrogen 
receptor hormone-binding domain (CreERT2) [16] was inserted into the trans-
lational stop codon of Nppa gene (before 3' UTR), with a self-cleaving 2 A pep-
tide sequence linking Nppa and CreER. The process of confirmation of the cor-
rect targeted clones and normal karyotype are as previously described standard 
protocols [17]. For germline transmission, C57B/6 lines were crossed with the 
obtained chimeric mouse lines. Knock-in mice used here were generated by Shang-
hai Biomodel Organism Science & Technology Development Co. Ltd. 
2) Genomic PCR 
Genomic DNA was prepared from embryonic yolk sac or mouse tail. Tissues 
were lysed by incubation with proteinase K overnight at 55˚C, followed by cen-
trifugation for 8 min to obtain supernatant with genomic DNA. DNA was preci-
pitated by adding isopropanol and was washed in 70% ethanol. All embryos and 
mice were genotyped with specific primers that distinguished the knock-in allele 
from the wild-type allele [18]. 
3) Stereo Microscopy 
Caesarean sectioning and cross-fostering of the mouse and heart sampling for 
stereo microscopy was prepared according to previous protocols [19]. Briefly, 
embryonic hearts from timed pregnancies and neonatal hearts of P0, P3, P5, P7, 
P28 and 8W were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 
15 min to 1 hour depending on the size of hearts at 4˚C. After wash with PBS for 
three times, whole mount bright-field and fluorescence view images were cap-

tured under Leica Stereomicroscope (M205 FA/DFC 7000T). 
4) Immunostaining on cryosections 
Immunostaining was performed according to previously described protocols 
[20]. Briefly, after stereomicroscopy processing, obtained fluorescence hearts were 
transferred to 30% sucrose for overnight cryopreservation at 4˚C and embedded 
in OCT (Sakura). Tissues were collected at 10 μm thick on positively charged 
adhesion microscope slides (CITOTEST) on cryotome (Thermo HM525 NX). Sec- 
tions were cryo-sectioned to reveal the coronary plane of atrial. PBS supplemented 
with 0.2% triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
were used for blocking at room temperature for 1 hour, followed by first anti-
body incubation at 4˚C overnight. For endogenous antigens detection, commer-
cial antibodies were used: GFP (Abcam, Invitrogen, Nacalai tesque Inc., 1:500), 
tdTomato (Rockland, 1:5000), TNNI3 (Abcam, 1:200). Fluorescence signals were 
amplified with Alexa fluorescence antibodies. Immunostaining images were pho-
tographed by Olympus fluorescence microscope (FV3000) and Leica stereomi-
croscope (M205 FA/DFC 7000T).
