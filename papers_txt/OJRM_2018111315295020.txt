1. Introduction 
Percutaneous administration of “Orthobiologics” with osteoinductive and osteoin-
tegrative properties offers the advantage of accelerated and functional recovery 
of musculoskeletal disorders. Due to recent advances in molecular and tissue en-
gineering and regeneration, the research on micromolecules has become the 
prime importance in the field of medical sciences. Stem cell offers a greater ad-
vantage of biological healing cascade without any significant morbidity to the 
individuals. The future relies on regenerative medicine called stem cells which 
has the scientific and ethical controversies. This article outlines the cell of inter-
est called mesenchymal stem cells usage in orthopaedics. 
2. Orthobiologics 
“Orthobiologics” are the biological agents which help in healing the muscular 
and skeletal disorders within a micromolecular and natural healing environment.

The bases of orthobiologics are: 
•  Matrix materials—Forms the ground substance and scaffold or frame work 
up-on which the stem cells forms the targeted tissue of interest. 
•  Growth factors—Potent substances to induce the tissue of interest. 
•  Stem cells—Biological cells which are cultured to produce the tissue of inter-
est. 
There are several forms of orthobiologics which are as follows: 
1) Bone grafts. 
2) Bone marrow aspirate. 
3) Demineralised bone matrix. 
4) Synthetic bone grafts. 
5) Autologous blood injection. 
6) Autologous conditioned serum. 
7) Platelet rich plasma. 
8) Stem cells. 
9) Growth factors. 
10) Bone morphogenetic proteins. 
Stem cells 
Stem cells are the naïve cells, blank cells (don’t possess any cell surface mark-
ers) and uncommitted cells which can be differentiated into other cell types and 
can self renew to produce same type of stem cells exponentially in a controlled 
manner (Figure 1). Broadly stem cells are classified into: 
a) Embryonic stem cells (ESC) [1] which are found in the inner mass of blas-
tocyst, 
b) Adult stem cells (ASC) [1] which are found in bone marrow, adipose tissue 
or blood cells, 
c) Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) [1] which are cultured in the labora-
tory to produce the tissue of interest.

•  Obligatory asymmetric replication—Renewal of stem cell from a daughter 
cell. 
•  Stochastic differentiation—Differentiation of one daughter cell into stem cell 
and differentiation of one daughter cell to undergo mitosis to form another 
stem cell. 
B) Differentiation 
 
 
 
Techniques of stem cell application 
a) Direct delivery—The aspirated bone or bone marrow is directly inserted to 
the injury site. This facilitates direct delivery of stem cells to the injury site and 
hastens the healing cascade. 
b) Cell based delivery—Bone marrow is aspirated, and the stem cells are iso-
lated, cultured and differentiated in laboratory media to increase their numbers 
before being applied to the injury site. 
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) 
Embryonic stem cells (ES cells or ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived 
from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, an early stage pre-implantation embryo. 
Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4 - 5 days post fertilization, at which 
time they consist of 50 - 150 cells. Isolating the embryoblast, or inner cell mass 
(ICM) results in destruction of the blastocyst, a process which raises ethical issues. 
Properties of embryonic stem cells 
Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent which are able to differentiate to gener-
ate primitive ectoderm, which ultimately differentiates during gastrulation into 
all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and me-
soderm. Under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of propa-
gating indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Conditions must either prevent 
the cells from clumping, or maintain an environment that supports an unspecia-
lized state. When provided with the appropriate signals, to differentiate (pre-
sumably via the initial formation of precursor cells) into nearly all mature cell 
phenotypes.

Uses of ESC are a) regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury 
or disease and b) pluripotent stem cells are used in the treatment of spinal cord 
injuries, age related macular degeneration, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders 
(such as Parkinson’s disease), AIDS. 
Adult stem cells (ASC) 
Adult stem cells, known as somatic stem cells, are undifferentiated cells, found 
throughout the body after development that multiply by cell division to reple-
nish dying cells and regenerate damaged tissues. ASC have the inherent property 
of self renewal and multidifferentiative potential. The signalling pathways present in 
ASC are a) NOTCH gene pathway for hematopoietic, neural and mammary 
stem cells, b) Wnt signalling pathway for proposed stem cell regulators and c) 
TGF-β to regulate the stemness of both normal and cancer stem cells. 
Types of adult stem cells: 
a) Hematopoietic stem cell—Bone marrow and umbilical cord. 
b) Mammary stem cell—Luminal and myoepithelial cell types of the gland. 
c) Intestinal stem cells—Crypts of Lieberkuhn. 
d) Mesenchymal stem cells. 
e) Endothelial stem cell—Cells that line blood vessels. 
f) Neural stem cell—Present in the subventricular zone, which lines the lateral 
ventricles, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. 
g) Olfactory adult stem cells. 
h) Ocular stem cells—Found in the area of limbus. 
i) Neural crest stem cells—Hair follicles which represents a remnant of stem 
cells of embryonic neural crest. These cells can generate neurons, Schwann cells, 
myofibroblast, chondrocytes and melanocytes. 
j) Testicular stem cells—Spermatogonial progenitor cells found in the testicles 
of laboratory mice by scientists in Germany and the United States. 
Induced pluripotent stem cells 
Induced pluripotent stem cells (also known as iPS cells or iPSCs) are a type of 
pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells. iPSCs are typ-
ically derived by introducing products of specific sets of pluripotency-associated 
genes, or “reprogramming factors”, into a given cell type. iPSC derivation is typ-
ically a slow and inefficient process, taking 1 - 2 weeks for mouse cells and 3 - 4 
weeks for human cells, with efficiencies around 0.01% - 0.1%. Upon introduc-
tion of reprogramming factors, cells begin to form colonies that resemble pluri-
potent stem cells, which can be isolated based on their morphology, conditions 
that select for their growth, or through expression of surface markers or reporter 
genes. The challenges in iPSC are low efficiency, inadequate programming, ge-
nomic insertion and tumorigenic potential. 
Method of induction of cells: 
•  Isolate and culture donor cells. 
•  Transduce stem cell-associated genes into the cells by viral vectors. Red cells 
indicate the cells expressing the exogenous genes.

•  Harvest and culture the cells according to ES cell culture, using mitotically 
inactivated feeder cells. 
•  A small subset of the transfected cells become iPS cells and generate ES-like 
colonies. 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 
Mesenchymal stem cells are the specialized form of adult stem cells which has 
the potential to differentiate into multi-lineage cell lines (Figure 2) such as osteo-
cyte, chondrocyte, adipocyte, neurocyte, myocyte, histiocyte and stromal cells. 
MSCs are found in bone marrow, cord cells, adipose tissue, amniotic fluid and 
molar teeth. 
 
 
Figure 2. Biology of mesenchymal stem cells. 
 
Salient features of MSC [2] [3] 
•  Adherent fibroblast like morphology. 
•  No expression of hematopoietic stem cell markers such as CD34 and CD14. 
•  Expression of matrix markers such as CD44, CD29 and CD71. 
•  Expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers, SH2 and SH105. 
•  Contains extra cellular matrix components such as collagen, proteoglycans 
and fibronectin. 
•  Growth factors and cytokine receptors for TGF-β. 
•  Anti proliferative activity to inhibit T cell proliferation into tumorigenic cells. 
•  Favours immunoprivilege & allogenic preparation. 
Culture of MSC 
Mesenchymal stem cells are cultured in basal medium such as Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine se-
rum (FBS). In culture, MSCs have a fibroblastic morphology. Primary cultures 
are usually maintained for 12 - 16 days, during which haematopoietic cell frac-
tion is depleted. The addition of growth factor supplements such as fibroblast 
growth factor-2 (FGF-2) to primary cultures of human MSCs to lead to an en-

hanced osteogenic potential [2] [3]. 
Immune modulation of MSCs [4] 
a) T lymphocyte system 
MSC-mediated immunoregulation is mediated through nitric oxide and indolea-
mine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which are only released by MSCs after triggering by 
IFNγ produced by target cells. IDO inhibits the proliferation of IFNγ-producing 
TH1 cells and, with PGE, to block NK-cell activity. 
2
b) HLA-G5 system 
MSCs produce soluble HLA-G5 which suppress T-cell proliferation, NK-cell 
and T-cell cytotoxicity, and promotes regulatory T cell production. 
Application of MHCs in Orthopedics 
a) Cartilage 
Cartilage is an avascular and aneural structure which has very limited poten-
tial for regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells are used to provide a scaffold and 
meshwork to rejuvenate the focal chondral defect by autologous chondrocyte 
implantation (ACI). ACI is a two-stage procedure, with assessment of the chon-
dral injury and biopsy to harvest 200 to 300 mg of healthy cartilage, followed by 
an enzymatic digestion and cell expansion in monolayer culture with cryopre-
servation of the cells which is further thawed and expanded to the target cell 
population. During the second stage, a biological reconstruction is performed to 
repair the articular cartilage defects to hasten the recovery with a successful 
functional outcome [5]. 
For osteoarthritis knee, the delivery of ultrasonicated adipose tissue offers a 
great advantage in proliferation of chondrocytes along with growth factors leads 
to better pain relief and functional improvement in quality of life. The dose of 
adipose tissue to be injected depends upon the grade of osteoarthritis and BMI 
of the individual [6]. 
b) Bone 
BMP receptor 1B is required for mesenchymal stem cell to form osteoblastic 
lineage in bone defects. Mesenchymal stem cells are used to enhance the regene-
ration of osseous defect in case of segmental bone loss, established non union 
and regeneration of physeal defect in children [7] [8]. The optimal loading of 
MSC on-to a carrier such as retroviral or adenoviral molecule offers a great ad-
vantage in minimally invasive procedure than conventional open surgical tech-
niques. These MSC should possess the properties of osteoinduction, osteocon-
duction, osteointegration and mechanical stimulation to regenerate osseous de-
fects. In segmental bone loss, calcium carbonate or hydroxyapatite scaffold is 
inserted upon which MSC are delivered to promote osteogenesis and osteointe-
gration [9]. 
c) Tendons 
The chronic and overuse of tendons leads to degenerative conditions such as 
plantar fasciitis, interscapular fibrofasciitis, tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow and ten-
dinopathies. Such degenerated tendon has an inferior potential to regenerate.

Autologous tenocyte injection is performed by a needle biopsy of healthy 
tendon which is subjected for isolation of cell of interest called tenocyte. Then 
tenocyte is amplified in cell cultured media and are injected into the injured or 
degenerated tendon [10]. 
Tendon bioengineering using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold, al-
logenic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells and injection of micro-
RNA with a loss of miR29 which results in increase in the production of type 
collagen 3 [11]. 
d) Ligaments 
Sports injuries will result in concomitant injury to ligaments which has very 
poor potential to regenerate. MSC along with bone morphogenetic protein 2 and 
7 & growth factors enhance neovascularization and regeneration of injured or 
degenerated ligaments. In ACL and meniscal rupture, intra-articular injection of 
MSCs with BMP 2 & 7 offers a biological healing of the ruptured ligaments. The 
scaffold based tissue bioengineering offers a greater advantage in ligamentous 
healing [12] [13]. 
e) Spine 
MSC transplantation into the degenerated disc offers a potential to increase 
proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans and induce degenerated spine & disc for 
regeneration and prevents vertebral collapse. The transported MSC maintain the 
viability of cells and involve in synthesizing micromolecules responsible for 
maintenance of disc shape [14]. 
MSC has the potent ability to form neural tissue and offers a functional life to 
patients with traumatic paraplegia. The injection of MSC along with carrier mo-
lecule to the injured site allows optimized enhancement of remyelination of the 
neural tubes and axons thereby restoring the spinal reflex arcs [15]. 
f) Miscellaneous disorders 
MSC has been tried in osteogenesis imperfecta where the defect lies in type 1 
collagen synthesis. MSC are directed to increase the bone strength & integrity 
and produces type 1 collagen which prevents recurrent fractures with trivial 
trauma. MSC eliminates the need of immunosuppression in patients with osteo-
genesis imperfecta [16]. 
In Duchene muscular dystrophy, the defect is due to mutation of dystrophin 
gene leads to the absence of dystrophin protein. MSC administration offers a 
greater advantage of contractile myotubules differentiation and regeneration of 
damaged myotubular system [17]. 
In avascular necrosis of bone, the primary pathology is idiopathic. Some theo-
ries states avascular necrosis is due to increased intra-osseous pressure. The aim 
of surgery is to decompress the intra-osseous pressure by drilling multiple holes 
in the bone. Delivering of MSCs in the drill holes leads to osteointegration and 
osteogenesis which helps in remodelling of the bony structures [18]. 
Significance of MSC over ESC and iPSC 
•  Mesenchymal stem cells are more advantageous than embryonic stem cells

and induced pluripotent stem cells. 
•  MSC are easily accessible from the donor and to be cultured upon the labor-
atory. 
•  MSC does not raise any ethical or legal concerns when compared to embryo-
nic stem cells. 
•  MSC does not possess any tumorigenic potential when compared to induced 
pluripotent stem cells. 
•  MSC possess immunoprivilege and immunomodulation at every point of cell 
cycle by which it is propagated to produce the tissue of interest. 
3. Conclusion 
MSCs admixed with micromolecules such as growth factors, cytokines & BMPs 
provide a three dimensional structure and biomechanically, structurally and 
functionally compliant to the naïve cells of host origin. Further research on the 
dosage and protocols on MSC for various disorders should be formulated which 
leads to decreased morbidity and improve the functional quality of life.
