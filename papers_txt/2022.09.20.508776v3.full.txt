ABSTRACT
Nucleic acids can act as potent modulators of proteinaggregation,andRNAisabletoeither
hinder or facilitate protein assembly depending on the molecular context. Here we used a
computational approach to characterize the physico-chemical properties of regions involved
in amyloid aggregation. In different experimental datasets weobservedthat,whilethecoreis
hydrophobic and highly ordered, external regions, more disordered, display a distinct
tendency to interact with nucleic acids.
To validate our predictions, we performed aggregation assays with α-synuclein (aS140), a
non-nucleic acid binding amyloidogenic protein, and a mutant truncated at the acidic
C-terminus (aS103) that is predicted to sequester RNA. For both aS140 and aS103 we
observed acceleration of the aggregation upon RNA addition with a significantly stronger
effect for aS103. Due to the favorable electrostatics, we observed enhanced nucleic-acid
sequestration ability for aS103 that entrapped a larger amount of RNA.
Overall, our research suggests that RNA sequestration is a rather common phenomenon
linked to protein aggregation and constitutes a gain-of-function mechanism to be further
investigated.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
Our study indicates that aggregation confers RNA-binding ability to non-RNA-binding
proteins such as alpha synuclein. The sequestration of RNA upon protein aggregation might
alter RNA homeostasis and impact multiple biochemical cascades.
INTRODUCTION
The order and structural robustness of amyloids render them a powerful platform for
attracting other cellular factors and macromolecules1,2. Nucleic acids are embroiled in the
modulation of protein phase transitions3,4, as recent experiments show that they can be
isolated from both physiological condensates and pathological inclusions5,6. RNA in
particularmightaffectaggregateaccumulationrateandnature7.Insupportofthisobservation,
numerous proteins found aggregated in neurological disorders are RNA-binding and form
ribonucleoprotein assemblies4, and their ability to aggregate appears to be at least in part
determined by the type and amount ofRNAfoundintheirproximity1.Yet,onlyafewstudies
have focused on understanding the ability of proteins to interact with nucleic acids after the
transition towards amyloid species has taken place, or whether such transition might confer
the ability to attract nucleic acids to proteins not classified as RNA/DNA-binding8.
Many canonical RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have a modular structure with one or more
RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and at least one prion-like domain able to drive phase
transitions9. Prion regions represent the core of the amyloid fibril structure upon
aggregation10,11 and the RBDs, usually found at least partially folded in the aggregated
species, are external to the core and might retain RNA-binding ability12. This is the case of
hnRNPDL-2, for which a cryo-EM structure of the aggregate shows two RBDs in a
disordered, solvent-exposed portion of fibrils outsideoftheamyloidcore12−the“fuzzycoat”.
hnRNPDL-2 fibrils have a comparable affinity towards oligonucleotides both in the
monomeric and the aggregated form12, confirming that canonical RBP aggregates can retain
their functionality even upon partial refolding into different conformations.
For non-canonical RBPs and for proteins that do not display RNA binding activity the
functional consequences of amyloid formation are less clear. In the case of
microtubule-associated protein tau, it has been shown that fibrils can sequester RNA both in
cell6 and in vitro13, implying the protein conformational changes upon aggregation can
promote RNA binding. This observation is further strengthened by the fact that tau fibrils,
grown in vitro and without any additional cofactors, can sequester RNA14. Tau is not known
as a canonical RBP, however it has been shown thatRNAco-localiseswiththisprotein15and
promotes its aggregation16 into morphologically distinct fibril strains17. A recent cryo-EM
structure has shown that RNA can also trigger the formation of a previously undetected tau
aggregate morphology with a central core spanning residues E391 to A42613. In previously
solved tau fibril structures, this specific segment has been reported to be part of the fuzzy
coat, implying that RNA can actively change the fibril morphology. Moreover, electron
density showedanunknowndensitythatcouldcorrespondtotheactualRNAmoleculesbeing
sequestered in the fibrils.
In this work, we use a computational approach to investigate nucleic acid sequestration in
protein aggregates by considering the physico-chemical properties of their amyloid cores,

hidden within the fibers and occupied in cross-β bonds, and their exterior, available to
establish novel interactions and exert new functions. We validated our model on alpha
synuclein (aS) that represents a particularly suitable case, since its phase transition is
abundantly studied and does not bind RNA in the monomeric state under physiological
conditions. aS is an intrinsically disordered protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking
and machinery assembly, mitochondrial homeostasis and DNA repair18–20. It has been
identified as the primary component of Lewy bodies21, pathological aggregates found in
certain neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Multiple System
Atrophy (MSA)21–23. aS has a modularorganization,withabasicN-terminus(residues1-95),
containing the amyloid central region (NAC, residues 61-95)24, and an acidic, intrinsically
disordered C-terminus (residues 96-140), shown to negatively affect fibrillation and
oligomerization25–27. The C-terminal domain can undergo several post-translational
modifications such as truncations at various residues28,29, which occur naturally in the cell,
presumably as incomplete protein degradation products. However, certain disease-related
C-terminal truncations also boost the protein fibrillation rates and result in diverseaggregate
morphologies, leading to an increase in cellular toxicity26,30–32. In the full length protein,
long-range electrostatic interactions between the N-terminus and C-terminus influence the
partially folded intermediary states of the protein and are highly affected by changes in pH
and ionic strength27,33–35. These factors, as well as the presence of various charged polymers,
strongly affect the aggregation rates, highlighting the role of electrostatic charge in aS
misfolding36–39. In the absence of the acidic C-terminus, such in the case of disease-related
truncations, it is possible that polyanions such as RNA could have an even more significant
impact on aS aggregation.
Based on our calculations, we hypothesize that amyloid-forming proteins, such as aS, can
acquire the ability to sequester RNA upon aggregation. We propose that RNA binding is an
acquired ability of aS aggregates and that this is the crucial contribution recapitulating the
experimental trend in aggregation rate modulation. More in general, our work indicates that
misfolding upon aggregation has the potential to vary the RNA-binding ability of any given
protein, potentially enabling a non-RNA-binding protein to acquire the ability to bind and
sequester RNA in its aggregated form.

RESULTS
Calculations recapitulate experimental results on the ability of tau fibrils to attract
RNA.
We started by assessing the robustness of our Zygregator-based calculations on the known
case of tau. A cryo-EM structure of tau fibrils (PDB 7SP1), grown in the presence of total
RNA, shows that RNA is trapped in a pocket on the external region of the aggregate13. The
binding occurs through cation-π interactions between an arginine residue and the RNA
phosphate backbone, as well as polar contacts between the RNA bases and the histidine
residue of tau13. The 36-amino acid regionoftheC-terminaldisordereddomain(residues391
- 426) is identified in the cryo-EM study as the fibril core13 and another work indicates that
the third microtubule-binding repeat (residues 306 – 335)59,60 contributes to tau aggregation.
Using the Zyggregator algorithm (Materials and Methods), which predicts
aggregation-prone elements in proteins41, we are able to successfully identify both these
regions (Fig. 1A).
More in detail, the cryo-EM structure of aggregated tau revealsthatresiduesR406andH407
on thetaufibrilsurfacedirectlyinteractwithsequesteredRNAandthatresiduesE391-S396,
V398, S400, D402, S404, D421, P423, I425, A426 are exposed to the solvent. In agreement
with this finding, we predict that the surface regions identified experimentally are less
hydrophobic, more disordered and have an increased RNA-binding ability (Fig. 1B;
Materials and Methods).
We note that residues 175-220and230-260,correspondingtotheproline-richregionandfirst
microtubule-binding repeat, have been reported to be directly involved in interactions with
RNA61 and identified as such by our approach (Fig. 1C). Although these disordered regions
arenotcapturedbycryo-EM,asnotinthestableamyloidcore,itcannotbeexcludedthatthey
play a role in sequestering RNAinthecourseofaggregation,asalsoremarkedbytheauthors
of the study13.
Thus, this initial result indicates that regions outside the core of tau amyloid fibrils have the
potential to interact with RNA and we are able to identify them in great detail using our
computational approaches. This finding also suggests that other aggregating proteinsmight
behave as tau. For a number of other disordered proteins, including calcitonin42,43, amylin44,
glucagon45, Aβ4246,47, α-synuclein48–50, hnRNPDL-212 and tau13,Zyggregatorshowsexcellent
performances in identifying the amyloid core of the aggregates, withanoptimalZyggregator
threshold  in the range 0.5-1.5(Fig. 1D).
Internal and external regions of amyloids have different biophysical properties
To further investigate the generaltrendthatregionsabletobindRNAareintheexternalparts
of amyloids, we retrieved a dataset of amyloids available from a recent publication62 and
analyzed their physico-chemical properties (Supplementary Table 1) using the Zyggregator
algorithm to identify regions forming the amyloid core  (Materials and Methods).

As expected, our calculations show that the internal part of an amyloid is more hydrophobic
than the external one (Fig. 2A). There is a significant shift of the RNA-binding propensity
and structural disorder in favor of the external part (Fig. 2B) while the electrostatic charge
distribution does not differ substantially (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). Notably, the trend is
observed with different physico-chemical propensity predictors (Supplementary Fig. 2)
Given the overall negative charge of the phosphate backbone of RNA and no significant
difference in the aggregate charge distribution, we find strong RNA-binding propensity
exclusively for positively charged protein regions.
To better visualize this trend we chose the structure of the amyloid formed by Podospora
anserina protein HET-s (PDB 2RNM) as an example (Fig. 2D-F). The structure was
determined using solid-state NMR and included the flexible external part of the amyloid.
Using different color scales, the distribution trends are clearly visible, especially in the
hydrophobic amyloid core (Fig. 2D). The RNA-bindingpropensityisconsiderablyhigherfor
the unstructured external portion of the fibers, similarly to the structuraldisorder(Fig.2D-F,
Supplementary Fig. 2B). Overall, the analysis of the HET-s amyloid structure shows
excellent agreement with the predicted results from the computational analysis.
Within the set of amyloids (Fig 2A-C), we analyzed proteins that have RNA and DNA
binding domains annotated in Uniprot (SupplementaryTables2and3).Consistentwithour
calculations of RNA-binding abilities, the nucleic acid-binding domains are predicted tobe
external to the aggregate (Fig. 2G). This is well exemplified by hnRNPDL-2, a protein in
which residues 224-280 were found by cryoEM to constitute the core of the fibril (PDB
7ZIR), while two RNA-binding domains are external12.Theaggregationpropensitypredicted
by Zyggregator captures the inner part of the aggregate very well, and the RNA-binding
domains are indeed predicted to be more exposed (Fig. 2H). Further investigating this
phenomenon at the human proteome level, we carried out predictions of prion and
RNA-bindingdomainsrespectivelyusingPLAAC51andcatRAPIDsignature63.Proportionally
to the overall aggregation propensity computed with Zyggregator, we observed that prion
domains are in the core of the fibril while RNA-binding domains tend to be external (Fig. 2
I-K, Supplementary Table 4). In agreement with our analysis of hnRNPDL-2, this finding
indicates thatpriondomainsareinternaltotheamyloidcore,whileRNA-bindingdomainsare
external.
Physico-chemical properties of alpha synuclein aggregates
We next analyzed the aggregation propensity of α-synuclein (aS or aS140), a protein with a
well-characterized amyloid core41. We computed both the overall score of the wild type
sequence (Fig. 3A) and performed a mutational analysis with 10 000 random single point
variations64. In accordance with the data shown in the literature65, the central region of the
protein is crucial for protein aggregation, with a peak coinciding with the NAC region
(residues 61-95) and individual peaks corresponding to the three-repeat region, as shown by
Doherty and colleagues24(Fig. 3A).
Mutations in the NAC region displayastrongimpactonaS140aggregation(Fig.3B)andthe
external regions of aS140 aggregates are predicted to be disordered with low overall

hydrophobicity and able to interact with RNA molecules (Fig. 3C). Amino acids 67-82
appear to be particularly sensitive to change and dramatically affect the propensity of aS to
aggregate, in agreement with previous experimental work66. Random single mutations in the
C-terminus have instead negligible effects. Yet, 14 out of the 24 negatively charged residues
in aS140 (18 Glu and 6 Asp) occur in this region, indicating that thetruncatedform,lacking
all amino acids in positions 103-140 (aS103), could behave differently compared to thewild
type protein in terms of aggregation propensity as well as RNA-binding ability.
Computing the scores of thephysico-chemicalpropertiesforbothaS140 andaS103revealsa
strong difference between the two (Fig. 3D). The removal of the 12 negatively charged
residues in the C-terminal portion results in a net charge increment (Fig. 3D). Accordingly,
the external regions of aS103 and aS140showalowerdegreeofhydrophobicitycomparedto
the average of the dataset and an increase in RNA-binding ability (Fig. 3D) due to the
abundance of charged and polar residues outside the NAC region.Wenotethatremovingthe
C-term slightly affects the predicted structural disorder, which is consistent with the overall
unfolded nature of the whole aS.
We used the catRAPID approach56,58 to estimate the ability of aS140 and aS103 to interact
with RNA (Materials and Methods). While the C-terminus and NAC show low interaction
propensity, the N-terminal domain is predicted to be external to the aggregate and able to
weakly interact withRNA(Fig.3E).Basedonthisobservation,wehypothesizethataSmight
be able to sequester RNA upon aggregation. As we will show in the following sections, this
effect could shape the dynamic of the aggregation propensity, tuningtheconcentrationofthe
RNA in solution.
RNA affects the aggregation of alpha synuclein isoforms in different ways
To study experimentally the effect thatRNAmighthaveontheaggregationkineticsofaS140
and aS103, we performed aggregation assays in the presence of a fluorescent aggregate
intercalator. Both aS103 and aS140 were incubated with increasing concentrations of total
RNA, from 0 to 500 ng/μL, for 24 h (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. 3A-B). Since the
experiments were performed in the presence ofareporterdye,visualizationoftheaggregates
at the end of the experiments with a fluorescence microscope confirmed the presence of
protein aggregates in all samples and in every tested condition (Supplementary Fig. 4A).
As previously reported in literature, aS103 aggregates significantly faster than aS140,
irrespectiveoftheconcentrationofRNA(Fig.3AandB)67,inagreementwithourpredictions
. In the presence of RNA, the elongation phase of aS103 is significantly faster than that of
aS140 (Fig. 4A) and is accompanied by a consistently shorter lag phase (Fig. 4B). Our data
analysis shows that the estimated aggregation rate ofaS103isapproximatelytwo-foldhigher
in the absence of RNA and up to 10-fold higher in the presence of 500 ng/μL total RNA
extract. Importantly, increasing concentrations of RNA lead to varied effects on the
aggregation rate of both proteins. For aS140, the aggregation rate in the presence of RNA
initially scales exponentially, increasing ca. five-fold at a concentration 250 ng/μL. Then the
rate seems toreachaplateauanddoesnotincreasefurther(Fig.4A).Bycontrast,incremental
additions of RNA monotonically increases the aggregation rate of aS103 over ten-fold,
reaching a maximum at 500 ng/μL with no evidence of reaching a plateau (Fig. 4A). RNA
affects the lag time in the oppositeway,withincreasingconcentrationseffectivelydecreasing

the lag time of aS103 until reaching a stable plateau at 1.6 h. The oppositeistrueforaS140,
where higher concentrations only start drastically decreasing the lag time with RNA
concentrationshigherthan250ng/μL(Fig.4B).Theactualmaximumvalueoffluorescenceat
the end of the exponential phase however does not differ much between aS103 and aS140
(Fig. 4C). RNA incrementally increases the level of maximum fluorescence by additions up
to 250 ng/μL when the value stabilizes. These results suggest not only that RNA has a
profound effect on aS aggregation, it also affects aS140 and aS103 in different and dynamic
ways as our computational analysis predicted.
Having observed the effect RNA has on theaggregationkineticsofaS,wethensettotestthe
original hypothesis thataScansequestertheRNAuponaggregation.Firstweverifiedthatthe
monomeric forms of both proteins do not interact with RNA (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
We then quantified the RNA before and after the aggregation assays in the soluble and
insoluble fractions as described (Materials and Methods). The concentration was measured
individually in each well and normalized according to the initial one. Because ofdifferences
in the volumes in different fractions (solubleandinsoluble),concentrationswererecalculated
into RNA mass and the data presented asthepercentageoftotalRNAmassafteraggregation
in different fractions (Fig. 4D and E). TheresultsclearlyindicatethatbothaS140andaS103
are able to sequester RNA through aggregation. Furthermore, there is a clear difference
between theamountofRNAsequesteredbyindividualproteinconstructs.Aspredictedbythe
computational analysis, aS103 aggregates can sequester RNA to a much higher degree than
aS140 (Fig. 4F). The difference is less noticeableatlowerRNAconcentrations,butbecomes
more pronounced at higher concentrations. As the starting concentration of the protein is
always 50 μM,itissafetoassumethedifferenceisduetothehighersequestrationcapacityof
aS103 aggregates formed. This is further supported by the fact that less than 10 % of the
starting amount of RNA is found soluble at the concentration of 50 ng/μL (Fig. 4D). This
sequestration capacity seems to be saturated at250ng/μLforaS103whileitkeepsincreasing
for aS140 (Fig. 4F).
To verify whether thedifferentdistributionofRNAamongthesolubleandinsolublefractions
is specific to protein aggregation, we repeated the experiments in the same conditions with
bovine serum albumin, a non-aggregating, non-RNA-binding protein. The quantification of
RNAinbothconditionsshowedcomparablevaluestothecontrolvaluesoftotalRNAwithout
any protein added (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The wells in both cases were inspected by
fluorescence microscopy and no aggregates were detected (Supplementary Fig. 4A).
We repeated the aggregation of aS103andaS140inthepresenceoftotalcellDNAextract,to
determine whether what we observed is an RNA-specific effect. Since DNA and RNA
degrade at different rates, we adjusted the normalization to account for it (Supplementary
Fig. 5B). aS103 still shows theabilitytosequesterDNAatlowerinitialDNAconcentrations,

aS140 barely sequesters any DNA in the aggregates, with less than 10% extracted from the
insoluble part (Supplementary Fig. 5D).

results further emphasize that protein aggregation is a dynamic process, and that aggregated
species not only display different biophysical features but could also acquire new functional
properties distinct from the ones attributed to the monomers.

DISCUSSION
Aggregates are able to sequester other molecules, including proteins1 and several
metabolites68. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RNA could be trapped by amyloid
aggregates. Our hypothesis was formulated considering that aggregation-prone regions of
proteins are mostly hydrophobic and buried in the core of fibrils41, while external regions,
prevalently hydrophilic and structurally disordered, can interact with nucleic acids, if their
electrostatics are favorable69. Several linesofevidence,bothcomputationalandexperimental,
seemed to confirm our idea. Regions outside the core of amyloids are predicted to interact
with RNA and annotated RNA-binding domains have a strong propensitytobeexternalwith
respect to the amyloid core. The recently reported cryoEMstructuresoftauandhnRNPDL-2
show that RNA can be trapped on the surface of the aggregate13 and the RNA-binding
domains are outside the amyloid core12.
Intriguingly, a number of artificial nucleic acid molecules, RNA and DNA aptamers, have
been designed to impact protein aggregation4,70. For instance, an aptamer called T-SO517,
developed by Ikebukuro and colleagues against oligomeric αS140, bound not only to the
target but also to Aβ40 oligomers71. This findingconfirmsourhypothesisthataggregatescan
bind to nucleic acids, although it indicates that the binding may be non-specific. Thus, it is
possible to speculate that sequestration of RNA material in the cellular context could
contribute to the toxicity of amyloid aggregates, a hypothesis that has been previously
formulated for proteins1.
Here, we reasoned that the formation of the amyloid core of aS fibrils, involving the most
hydrophobic residues (i.e., the NAC region), leaves the chargedaminoacids(i.e.,N-terminal
and C-terminal) available for interactions with other molecules such as RNA. This is
corroborated by a number of experiments such as site-directed spin labeling coupled with
EPR, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and limited proteolysis34,48–50, indicating that the central
part of the protein is engaged in forming the core of the aggregates while therestisexposed
to the solvent. We predicted that removal of the negative charges corresponding to amino
acids 104-140, not included in the core of the aggregate, would sharply increase the
RNA-binding propensity of the regions outside the NAC. Thus, we tested the hypothesis of
RNA-binding gain-of-function upon aggregation.
Our experimental results confirm the computational observation of acquired RNA
sequestration ability and identifyitasawayofmodulatingaSaggregationprocessbydirectly
affecting the aggregation rates. Sequestration is protein-sequence dependent: aS103 shows a
higher sequestration propensity compared to wild type aS140, likely due to the increased
electrostatic attraction. RNA also modifies the aggregation rate of both aS variants.
As previously reported, the key to modulating aS aggregation propensity lies in the
long-range intra and intermolecular interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal
domains of the protein, which shield theNACregionandpreventitsself-assembly34,35. RNA
likely enters in contact with the N-terminal, thus interfering with these interactions. The
truncated aS103 lacks the C-terminal domain and a priori cannot engage in the shielding
effect of the NAC region. Itisplausiblethat,throughtransientinteractionsviatheN-terminal
domain, RNA acts as a molecular bridge between protein molecules, bringing the NAC
regions into closer contacts. As C-terminal truncations of aS are commonly found in brain

samples from patients and aS103 is prevalent in the medial temporal lobe in Lewy body
dementia, we speculate that RNA might play a role in the onset of the disease28.
Very recently, the combined solid-state NMR - cryoEMapproachtostudythefibrilsofaSby
Zhang and colleagues has confirmed our observations regarding the outer disorder of aS
fibrils 72. The structure (PDB 7YK2) however also highlighted the ordering and interaction
between the core of the fibril and the G14 - G25 region intheN-terminalpart.Thissuggests
that additional ordering of the structuremightbepresentintheN-terminusuponaggregation.
It is important to note, however, that the fibrils in the study were grown in the absence of
RNA, which could potentially prevent these additional ordering to occur uponmisfoldingby
shielding the N-terminus.
We note that RNA concentrations in our experiments are near-to-physiological. Indeed, we
considered a mammalian cell has a cell volume between 1,000 and 10,000 μm3 (i.e., 10-6μL
-10-5 μL 73) and an RNA amount of 10 - 30 pg (i.e., 0.01 - 0.03 ng 74), whichindicatesthat
500 ng/μL of RNA are in the expected normal range (i.e., 0.01 ng in10-5μL,whichis1000
ng/μL). Monomeric, physiological aS was found associated with nucleic acids20,75,
nucleosomes76 and processing bodies77. However, no proof of direct and functional RNA
binding by the cytosolic, aggregated aS has ever been discovered. While Siegert and
colleagues have shown RNA has little effect and canactuallyabrogateaSphaseseparation78,
the molecular aspects of the effect of RNA on aS liquid-to-solid phase transition was not
characterized. It should be mentioned that Cohlberg and colleagues have previouslyreported
that negatively charged molecules such as heparindisplayastrongereffectonaSaggregation
compared to 1µg/μL RNA38. Nevertheless, it must benotedthattheauthorsusedthioflavinT
to quantify aS aggregation. It has been reported that this dye can interact also with RNA79,
interfering with the correct quantification of protein aggregation.Forthisreason,weselected
a different aggregation reporter, ProteostatTM, that binds to RNA only weakly80, obtaining
significantly different results. An intriguing aspect is the pathological implication of RNA
sequestration in synucleinopathies.
Overall our study shows that aggregation and the misfolding associated with it can lead to
different biophysical and functional properties compared to the monomeric soluble protein
forms. aS, a non-RNA-binding protein, can acquire the ability to sequester RNA in a
sequence-dependent manner, bringing further emphasis on the dynamic structural and
functional transitions between different protein states.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Amyloid Dataset
Amyloid proteins (Supplementary Table 1) were taken from the PRALINE database40. The
internal and external parts of amyloids were computed using Zyggregator41. In Fig. 1, we
report the comparison of predicted and experimentally validatedinternalandexternalregions
of calcitonin42,43, amylin44, glucagon45, Aβ4246,47, α-synuclein48–50, hnRNPDL-212 and tau13.

Analysis of the inner and outer part of amyloids
For each residueinagivensequence(SupplementaryTable1),weusedtheZyggregatorthat
predicts the individual contribution to aggregation based on predictions of hydrophobicity,
secondary structure and 41. Our previous work indicates that the residues with high
aggregation propensities are buried in the fibril, while those with lowaggregationpropensity
are exposed to the solvent41.
RNA/DNA binding domains and  aggregation
We exploited annotations of RNA/DNA binding domains available from UniProt to
characterize their physico-chemical properties in relation to the aggregation propensity
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 2). Specifically, we computed the fraction of
RNA/DNA domains belonging to the predicted external part of the amyloids. The same
analysis was carried out for prion domains predicted using PLAAC51, asina previouswork9
(Fig. 2).
Random mutagenesis
We performed an in silico random mutation analysis to define the role ofeachresidueofaS
sequence in the aggregation propensity of the protein. We selected random positions in the
sequence and replaced them, one by one, with amino acids from anuniformdistribution.We
used the Zyggregator algorithm41to compute the aggregation propensityoftheproteinbefore
and after the mutation since, for each residue in a given sequence, the method predicts the
individual contribution to aggregation41. We simulated 10000 random mutations and
calculated for each one the difference with the wild type in terms of Zyggregator score,
expressed as a percentage.
Physico-chemical properties of external regions
Calculations of hydrophobicity52, disorder53 and RNA-binding ability54 have been carriedout
through the CleverMachine approach that predicts physico-chemical properties of protein
sequences55.

In the Supporting Information (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2), we show that the particular
scale used is not strictly important, asthebehaviorofthehistogramsofthechemicalphysical
property did not change with the scale change.
catRAPID predictions of protein-RNA interactions
In catRAPID, the interaction propensity between a protein-RNA pair is computed using
secondary structure properties, van der Waals and hydrogen bonding potentials56. The
algorithm is able to separate interacting versus non-interacting pairs with an area under the
curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of0.78(withfalsediscoveryrate
(FDR) significantly below 0.25 when the Z-score values are >2)57. In this work, the
N-terminus of aS (residues 1-25) is predicted to attract RNA, while the C-terminal region
(residues 104-140) shows much poorer propensity. In our calculations58, we used the human
transcriptome and computed the overall interaction propensity (>0.4 corresponding to low
binding affinity) for different aS regions. TDP43, TRA2A and SRSF3 are used as a positive
control. aS103 and aS140 are not predicted to interact as monomers.
Protein production
The cDNA for the aS140 was inserted in a pET21a vector under the control of the T7
promoter. The aS103 cDNA was produced by deletion of the appropriate sequence from the
full length construct with specific PCR primers (aS103for:
5'-TAAGCGGCCGCACTCGAGCAC-3' and aS103rev:
5'-ATTCTTGCCCAACTGGTCCTTTTTGACAAAGC-3').
Competent E.coli BL21 [DE3] cells were transformed with both constructs. 2 L of fresh LB
broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin wereinoculatedwithovernightcultureswitha
100:1 ratio. Cultures were grown at 37 °C up to an optical density of ca. 0.7 at 600 nm.
Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTGandthecultureswereshakenfor4hours.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at4500gat4°Cfor30min,afterwardsthepelletwas
resuspended on ice in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and frozen immediately.
For protein purification the cells were thawed in ice-coldwaterandlysedbyboilingat95°C
for 30 min. The boiled suspension was centrifuged at 18000 g at 4 °C for 30 min, then
streptomycin sulfate was added to the supernatant up to a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The
solution was centrifuged at 18000 g at 4 °C for 30 min and thepelletcontainingprecipitated
impurities was discarded. The protein was slowly precipitated by addition of crystalline

The proteins were purified using heparin affinity chromatography on a HiTrapTM Heparin
column to remove remaining nucleic acids. Proteins were eluted with heparin elution buffer
(20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2, 800 M NaCl) and loaded onto a HiLoadTM 16/600

Protein aggregation assays
A frozen protein aliquote of aS140 or aS103 was quickly thawedandfilteredwitha0.22μm
syringe filter immediately before each assay. Total yeast RNA (totRNA, Roche) was
resuspended in aggregation assay buffer (20 mM potassium phosphatepH7.2,100mMKCl,
5mMMgCl ).ForaggregationassaysinthepresenceofDNA,totalDNAfromherringsperm

a 1000-time diluted ProteostatTM detection dye. For the BSA control, ultra-pure, DNA- and
RNA-free BSA was used (Sigma Merck) and diluted to the final concentrationinthesample
buffer as described above for aS. The samples were distributed in 6 replicates on a 96-well
black plate with transparent bottom and a single borosilicate glass bead was added to each
well to ensure sample homogeneity and reproducibility. Theexcitationwavelengthwassetto

All protein samples were aggregated in parallel to total RNA alone at the same starting
concentrations and conditions for RNA degradation control and the values reported have
already been accounted for degradation.
Aggregation data analysis
Data from the aggregation assays, obtained with ProteostatTM fluorescence dye, were fitted
into a sigmoid curve using the Hill function (1):

where A, h and K are the fitting parameters.
To compute the aggregation rate, we determined the slope ofthefittedcurvesbeforeplateau.
With the previously set parameters and a Taylor expansion of ℎ(𝑥) around 𝐾, we calculated
the slope of the aggregationαcurve as (2):

Nucleic acid quantification and extraction from protein aggregates
After aggregation, individual replicates were transferred from the 96-well platetoEppendorf
tubes and centrifuged at 4 °C, 18.000 g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was transferred to
another tube, RNA found in solution was quantified using Qubit RNA BR, and DNA with
Qubit DNA BR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
For RNA extraction, the insoluble pellet was resuspended in 25 μL of digestion buffer (2 M
urea, 100 μg/mL proteinase K, 3 mM DTT) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min.
125 μL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of 5 M and the
sample was incubated at room temperature for further 30 min. 1 mL of TrizolTM was added
and RNA was extracted using standard protocol by the manufacturer.
DNA was extracted from the insoluble protein pellet with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer protocol for DNA extraction from blood.
The final elution was performed in 50 μL of buffer AE. Extracted nucleic acids were again
quantified using the Qubit fluorescent dyes.

Figure 1. Tau aggregation profile and prediction of physico-chemical properties. A)
Aggregation propensity profile of tau, with the predictions of the filament internal part in
orange, while green and red bars indicate the regions found to be internalexperimentally.B)
Physico-chemical properties ofresidues391-441,withtheinternalandexternalpropertiesof
the region marked in black (in) and red (out), respectively. C) Hydrophobicity, disorder, and
RNA binding propensity of the entire sequence. D) ROC curve computed to determine the
optimal Zyggregator threshold for finding internal and external residues based on
experimental data from various proteins. The optimal Zyggregator threshold is in the range
0.5-1.5.
Figure 2. Physico-chemical properties of internal and external regions of amyloids. A-C)
Distribution score of the amyloid dataset using the Zyggregator method for internal and
external portions of the amyloids (the curves are significantly different with p-value<0.05;
Kolmogorov Smirnov test).. D-F) Molecular structure of the HET-s prion protein (PDB
2RNM) solved by solid-state NMR, depicted by different color scales for hydrophobicity,
RNA-binding propensity, and disorder, respectively. G) Percentage of the RNA and DNA
binding domains belonging to the external part of the fibril. H) Zyggregator profile of
hnRNPDL-2. Black lines mark the RBDs and the red line the internal residues found
experimentally. I-K) Percentage of residues exposed fortheRNA-bindingandpriondomains
for the human proteome at different aggregation propensity scores (see also Supplementary
Table 4).
Figure 3. Aggregation propensity of aS140 and aS103. A) Zyggregator profile of aS140, with
colored bars indicating predicted internal and external parts. The experimentally determined
amyloid core of aS is marked with a red bar. B) Physico-chemical properties of aS140 and
aS103. C) Random mutagenesis analysis shows that the NAC region and N-terminus are
susceptible to significant changes in aggregation propensity. D) Hydrophobicity,
RNA-binding propensity, and disorder of aS relative to its internal and external parts.
Differences with respect to the mean of the amyloid histograms are shown (Fig. 2A-C). E)
RNA-binding predictions of different regions of aS140 and aS103, compared with canonical
RBP (scores > 0.5 indicate non-negligible interaction propensities).
Figure 4. In vitro aggregation assays of aS140 and aS103 in the presence of RNA. A)
Calculated aggregation rates from aggregation data (SupplementaryFig.3)oftimeresolved
Proteostat™ fluorescence.Datashownarecalculatedfromparameters,derivedfromthefitted
curve to 6 technical replicates of 3 separate experiments (see Materials and Methods). The
presence of RNA increases the rate of aggregation for both proteins, with the aS140 rate
reaching a plateau with concentrations higher than 250 ng/µL. aS103 has a significantly
shorter aggregation lag time than aS140. B) The addition of RNA further decreases the lag
phase, however increasing concentrations donotseemtodrasticallyaffectiffurtherwhilethe
opposite is true for aS140. C) Increasing concentration of RNA also elevates the plateau of
fluorescence for both proteins, especially significantly foraS103.DandE)Quantificationof
nucleic acids from aS aggregation assays indicates different behavior for aS140 and aS103.
