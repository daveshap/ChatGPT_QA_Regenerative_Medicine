Abstract 
1  N-acyl amino acids are a large family of circulating lipid metabolites that modulate energy 
2  expenditure and fat mass in rodents.  However, little is known about the regulation and potential 
3  cardiometabolic functions of N-acyl amino acids in humans. Here, we analyze the 
4  cardiometabolic phenotype associations and genetic regulation of four plasma N-fatty acyl 
5  amino acids (N-oleoyl-leucine, N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, N-oleoyl-serine, and N-oleoyl-glycine) in 
6  2,351 individuals from the Jackson Heart Study. N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine 
7  were positively associated with traits related to energy balance, including body mass index, 
8  waist circumference, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, we identify the CYP4F2 
9  locus as a human-specific genetic determinant of plasma N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
10  phenylalanine levels. In vitro, CYP4F2-mediated hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
11  phenylalanine results in metabolic diversification and production of many previously unknown 
12  lipid metabolites with varying characteristics of the fatty acid tail group, including several that 
13  structurally resemble fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs). By contrast, FAAH-regulated N-
14  oleoyl-glycine and N-oleoyl-serine were inversely associated with traits related to glucose and 
15  lipid homeostasis. These data uncover a human-specific enzymatic node for the metabolism of 
16  a subset of N-fatty acyl amino acids and establish a framework for understanding the 
17  cardiometabolic roles of individual N-fatty acyl amino acids in humans.

18  Main 
19  The N-acyl amino acids are a large and structurally diverse family of circulating lipid signaling 
20  molecules. These lipid metabolites are unusual peptide conjugates of fatty acids and amino 
21  acids. In mice, levels of specific circulating N-acyl amino acids are tightly controlled by the 
22  action of two enzymes, PM20D1 and FAAH, which catalyze bidirectional N-acyl amino acid 
23  synthesis from and hydrolysis to free fatty acids and free amino acids1-4. Pharmacological, 
24  genetic, and mechanistic studies in rodents suggest that certain members of the N-acyl amino 
25  acids stimulate mitochondrial respiration and whole-body energy expenditure1. Other 
26  complementary studies have also established roles for N-acyl amino acids in glucose 
27  homeostasis2, adipogenesis5, vascular tone6,7, and bone homeostasis8,9. Importantly, the 
28  functional consequence and enzymatic regulation of each N-acyl amino acid is highly 
29  dependent on the structural properties of the fatty acid tail group and amino acid head group. 
30  For example, even subtle modification of the lipid chain or amino acid moieties can effect N-
31  acyl-amino acid substrate specificity for PM20D1 and ligand potency in mitochondrial 
32  respiration1.   
33  Despite the considerable body of rodent literature on N-acyl amino acids, our knowledge 
34  of the regulation and clinical associations of these lipid metabolites in humans is still lacking.  
35  Two small studies have previously investigated the role of PM20D1 in the regulation of N-acyl 
36  amino acids in human plasma. In one report, plasma N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
37  phenylalanine levels were found to be associated with circulating PM20D1 protein levels and 
38  correlated positively with adiposity and several parameters of glucose homeostasis10. However, 
39  a second study failed to identify any association of serum levels of two N-acyl amino acids, N-
40  oleoyl-leucine or N-oleoyl-glutamine, with genetic variants in the PM20D1 locus though in a very 
41  small cohort11. The conflicting human data, as well as the scope of phenotypes and limited 
42  number of individuals examined in the previous two studies therefore motivate additional 
43  investigations as to the clinical relevance and genetic underpinnings of this class of molecules.

44  Our group recently measured circulating levels of four N-acyl-amino acids (N-oleoyl-
45  glycine, N-oleoyl-serine, N-oleoyl-leucine, and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine) in plasma samples from 
46  2,351 participants of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) using liquid chromatography-mass 
47  spectrometry (LC-MS)12.  In two broad metabolomic-wide association studies in this population, 
48  we identified that levels of N-oleoyl serine and N-oleoyl leucine were among the top metabolites 
49  in human plasma associated with future risk of coronary heart disease13 and heart failure12, 
50  respectively. These observations extend prior studies in murine models and suggest that 
51  additional investigations of N-acyl amino acid biology may provide important new insights into 
52  human metabolism and cardiometabolic disease. 
53  Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the role of the oleic fatty acid tail group and 
54  amino acid head group in driving associations with cardiometabolic disease. We use genome 
55  wide association studies (GWAS) to distinguish between different molecular species of N-acyl 
56  amino acids according to amino acid head group. Further, this analysis identifies a previously 
57  unknown enzymatic regulator of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, CYP4F2, in 
58  humans.  Finally, we use untargeted metabolomics in live cells to map the fate of N-oleoyl-
59  leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine downstream of CYP4F2 hydroxylation and identify 
60  numerous previously unknown lipid metabolites with varying characteristics of the fatty acid tail 
61  group, including several that structurally resemble fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), a 
62  recently-discovered family of bioactive lipids that signal through specific G protein-coupled 
63  receptors to improve glucose-insulin homeostasis and block inflammatory cytokine production14.  
64  Our data integrating mass spectrometry, human phenotyping, genetics, and model systems 
65  provide new insights to this emerging class of molecules.

70  Results 
71   
72  N-acyl amino acids are associated with cardiometabolic disease independent of free 
73  amino acid plasma levels and according to the amino acid head group  
74  We recently measured circulating levels of N-oleoyl-glycine, N-oleoyl-serine, N-oleoyl-
75  leucine, and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine in plasma samples from 2,351 participants of the JHS using 
76  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as described12. Baseline characteristics of 
77  the JHS study participants are detailed in Supplemental Table 1. Age- and sex-adjusted 
78  analyses identified N-oleoyl-serine and N-oleoyl-leucine as top metabolites associated with the 
79  future risk of coronary heart disease13 and heart failure12, respectively. However, prior work did 
80  not examine whether the associations of the intact N-acyl oleic acid conjugate of each amino 
81  acid were independent of the corresponding free amino acid (Fig. 1a). Using age-, sex-, and 
82  batch-adjusted Cox regression models, we determined that the association between N-oleoyl-
83  serine and the future risk of coronary heart disease remained unaffected when further adjusted 
84  for free serine (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81 per 1 SD increment in transformed and normalized 
85  metabolite level; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94; p-value = 7.3x10-3; median follow up 11.6 years).  
86  Similarly, the association between N-oleoyl-leucine and future heart failure remained highly 
87  significant when further adjusted for free leucine (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.91; p-value = 
88  2.1x10-3; median follow up 12.6 years).  These observations may point towards additional 
89  biological mechanisms conferred by the oleic acid tail group of N-acyl serine and N-acyl glycine.    
90  We next investigated how the amino acid head group of each N-acyl amino acid 
91  contributed to associations with cardiometabolic disease. As shown in Fig. 1b, we found that 
92  the associations of measured N-acyl amino acids with cardiometabolic traits in JHS bifurcated 
93  into two classes depending on the characteristics of the head group. Whereas N-oleoyl-glycine 
94  and serine were associated with “protective” traits, showing strong inverse associations with 
95  prevalent diabetes (N-oleoyl-glycine beta = -0.58, p-value = 3.5x10-25; N-oleoyl-serine beta = -

97  2.3x10-4; N-oleoyl-serine beta = -0.17, p-value = 2.7x10-4), and prevalent coronary heart disease 
98  (N-oleoyl-glycine beta = -0.42, p-value = 5.2x10-7; N-oleoyl-serine beta = -0.46, p-value = 
99  8.1x10-8), N-oleoyl-leucine and phenylalanine demonstrated positive associations with 
100  cardiometabolically “disadvantageous” traits, such as body mass index (N-oleoyl-leucine beta = 
101  0.12, p-value = 1.5x10-8; N-oleoyl-phenylalanine beta = 0.10, p-value = 1.9x10-6), waist 
102  circumference (N-oleoyl-leucine beta = 0.10, p-value = 2.5x10-6; N-oleoyl-phenylalanine beta = 
103  0.09, p-value = 5.6x10-6), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (N-oleoyl-leucine beta = 0.10, p-
104  value = 5.6x10-5; N-oleoyl-phenylalanine beta = 0.08, p-value = 6.1x10-4) (Fig. 1b). The inverse 
105  associations between N-oleoyl-glycine and serine with cardiometabolic disease remained highly 
106  significant when further adjusted for BMI (Supplemental Table 2).   
107   
108  Genetic loci associated with levels of N-acyl amino acids in human plasma 
109  In order to determine if the genetic determinants of N-acyl amino acid plasma levels also 
110  differ according to amino acid head group, we leveraged available whole genome sequencing 
111  data (NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog study GCP00023915) in the JHS to compare genome wide 
112  associations between oleic acid N-acyl conjugates of serine, glycine, leucine, and 
113  phenylalanine, as described16.  As shown in Fig. 2A, we identified a strong association between 
114  the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) genetic locus and plasma levels of N-oleoyl-glycine 
115  (sentinel variant rs324420, p-value = 5.7x10-64, beta 0.54, n=2463) and N-oleoyl-serine (sentinel 
116  variant rs324420, p-value = 3.6x10-32, beta 0.38, n=2101). These findings are consistent with 
117  studies in cell- and murine-based systems that have identified FAAH as an intracellular N-acyl 
118  amino acid synthase/hydrolase. Interestingly, the sentinel variant for both metabolites was a 
119  common (observed MAF = 0.21 in JHS and global MAF 0.21 as reported in the NCBI Allele 
120  Frequency Aggregator), missense variant (chr1:46405089C>A; Pro129Thr) that has previously

121  been shown to reduce FAAH stability and enzymatic activity in cell-based model systems and 
122  has been associated with overweight and obesity in human studies17,18.   
123  However, we were interested to find that the FAAH locus was not associated with 
124  plasma levels of N-oleoyl-leucine or N-oleoyl-phenylalanine in humans at genome-wide (p-value 
125  ≤ 5 x 10-8), or even nominal levels of statistical significance (sentinel variant rs324420 
126  association with N-oleoyl-leucine p-value = 0.29 and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine p-value = 0.13). 
127  Additionally, all four N-acyl amino acids demonstrated no significant association with the 
128  PM20D1 locus (p-values ≥ 0.001 for the associations between each N-acyl amino acid and all 
129  variants between the PM20D1 transcriptional start and end sites, chr1:205,828,025-
130  205,850,132).  Instead, we unexpectedly identified a strong association between the CYP4F2 
131  locus on chromosome 19 and N-oleoyl-leucine (sentinel variant rs2108622, p-value = 5.7x10-16, 
132  beta 0.44, n = 2101) and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine (sentinel variant rs2108622, p-value = 2.9x10-
133  19, beta 0.47, n = 2099) (Fig. 2B).  CYP4F2 is a cytochrome P450 that catalyzes the omega-
134  hydroxylation of lipophilic substrates. 
135  Taken together, these human genetic data point to specific pathways that regulate 
136  circulating N-acyl amino acid levels according to the amino acid head group. In particular, the 
137  association of the CYP4F2 locus with circulating N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine 
138  was unexpected, and the role of CYP4F2 in N-acyl amino acid metabolism has not been 
139  explored. 
140   
141  CYP4F2-mediated omega-hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine  
142  Canonically, CYP4F2 catalyzes the omega (e.g., terminal) hydroxylation of specific 
143  lipophilic substrates, including fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid)19 and vitamins (e.g., vitamin E 
144  and K)20,21. The identification of CYP4F2 as a potential enzymatic regulator of N-oleoyl-
145  leucine/phenylalanine was surprising since this enzyme had not been previously implicated in 
146  the metabolism of fatty acid-amino acid conjugates. Nevertheless, we reasoned that CYP4F2

147  might also catalyze the omega hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine 
148  (Fig. 3A). To directly test this hypothesis in vitro, we first generated lysates overexpressing 
149  CYP4F2 by transfection of plasmids expressing human CYP4F2 into HEK293T cells (Fig. 3b, 
150  left). Transfected whole cell lysates were then assayed for the ability to catalyze N-oleoyl-
151  leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine hydroxylation in the presence of NADPH.  As shown in Fig. 
152  3B (right), CYP4F2-transfected cell lysates exhibited a robust hydroxylation activity on both N-
153  acyl amino acids, leading to production of two previously unknown lipid species in vitro, 
154  hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine and hydroxy-oleoyl-phenylalanine.  The absolute rates of CYP4F2-
155  mediated hydroxylation of these N-acyl amino acids were similar to that of a canonical CYP4F2 
156  substrate, arachidonic acid (Supplementary Fig. 1A).  Additionally, we observed increasing 
157  formation rates of hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine and hydroxy-oleoyl-phenylalanine across a range of N-
158  oleoyl-leucine/phenylalanine substrate concentrations (Fig. 3C).  Notably, this range of low-mid 
159  μM concentrations of N-oleoyl-leucine/phenylalanine correlate to prior studies that detected 
160  functional effects of these N-acyl amino acids on energy homeostasis at similar murine model 
161  plasma levels and cell-culture treatment doses.  The use of CYP4F2-transfected lysates 
162  precluded the ability to calculate the catalytic parameters, selectivity, or specificity of this 
163  reaction. .  These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 catalyzes the hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-
164  leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine in vitro and provide a biochemical explanation for the 
165  observed association between the CYP4F2 gene locus and circulating N-oleoyl-leucine and N-
166  oleoyl-phenylalanine levels in humans. 
167  The sentinel variant in the CYP4F2 locus that was associated with N-oleoyl-leucine and 
168  N-oleoyl-phenylalanine plasma levels in our human studies was a chr19:15879621C>T 
169  missense variant that results in a Val433Met substitution (Fig. 2B).  To examine the 
170  consequences of the specific CYP4F2 (V433M) variant on N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
171  phenylalanine hydroxylation activity, we performed similar in vitro hydroxylation activity assays 
172  with CYP4F2 (V433V) or CYP4F2 (V433M) enzymes.  Equivalent transfection for both alleles

173  was confirmed by equivalent mRNA levels (Fig. 3D).  Under these conditions, both the CYP4F2 
174  protein as well as N-oleoyl-leucine, N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, and arachidonic acid hydroxylation 
175  activities of CYP4F2(V433M) were lower than that of CYP4F2(V433V) (Fig. 3D and 
176  Supplementary Fig. 1B).  To determine the relative activity of CYP4F2 (V433V) or CYP4F2 
177  (V433M) under conditions of equal protein loading, we normalized levels of CYP4F2 (V433M) 
178  and CYP4F2 (V433V) protein as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3E).  CYP4F2 (V433M) 
179  exhibited reduced hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-leucine, N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, and arachidonic 
180  acid compared to CYP4F2 (V433V) (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. 1C).  These data 
181  demonstrate that CYP4F2 (V433M) has both lower catalytic efficiency as well as reduced 
182  protein levels relative to CYP4F2 (V433V).  
183  To further characterize the functional consequence of the CYP4F2 on circulating levels 
184  of N-acyl amino acids in human plasma, we analyzed levels of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
185  phenylalanine in participants of the JHS categorized according to carriage of the common 
186  CYP4F2 Val433Met (chr19:15879621C>T) missense variant.  As shown in Fig. 3F, we 
187  identified that heterozygous carriers of the CYP4F2(19:15879621C>T) genotype in the JHS 
188  (N=340) had higher circulating levels of plasma N-oleoyl-leucine (log-transformed and 
189  standardized level = 0.3, p-value 1.9x10-9) and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine (log-transformed and 
190  standardized level = 0.3, p-value 3.3x10-10) compared to non-carriers (log-transformed and 
191  standardized level of N-oleoyl-leucine = 0.0; N-oleoyl-phenylalanine = -0.1; N=1741). Similarly, 
192  homozygote carriers of the CYP4F2 (19:15879621C>T) genotype (N=18) had even higher 
193  plasma levels of N-oleoyl-leucine (log-transformed and standardized level = 1.02, p-value 
194  3.3x10-3) and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine (log-transformed and standardized level = 1.31, p-value 
195  5.6x10-4) compared to heterozygotes.  We therefore conclude that a common missense variant 
196  in CYP4F2 leading to elevated plasma N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine in humans 
197  also reduces CYP4F2 N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine hydroxylation activity in 
198  vitro.

200  N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine are competitive inhibitors of CYP4F2 
201  The ability of CYP4F2 to hydroxylate multiple endogenous lipid substrates raises the 
202  possibility that active site competition might modulate the relative flux of each substrate through 
203  CYP4F2 (Fig. 4A).  To mechanistically examine whether such substrate competition might 
204  occur, we used our in vitro CYP4F2 enzyme activity assay to directly measure substrate 
205  competition between N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine on the canonical CYP4F2 
206  substrate arachidonic acid. At a 1:1 molar ratio, N-oleoyl-leucine efficiently inhibited CYP4F2-
207  mediated conversion of arachidonic acid to 20-HETE (86% suppression, Fig. 4B).  Similar 
208  results were observed with N-oleoyl-phenylalanine (76% suppression, Fig. 4B).  A dose 
209  response curve demonstrated that either N-oleoyl-leucine or N-oleoyl-phenylalanine could 
210  inhibit CYP4F2-mediated arachidonic acid hydroxylation even at substoichiometric levels (10 
211  mol%, Fig. 4B).  To examine the potential generality of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
212  phenylalanine inhibition of CYP4F2, we performed similar in vitro competition experiments with 
213  two additional CYP4F2 substrates, docosanoic acid and 8-HETE.  As shown in Fig. 4C-D, both 
214  N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine competed CYP4F2-mediated hydroxylation of both 
215  8-HETE and docosanoic acid, but with differences in potency.  For instance, even at 
216  substoichiometric levels (10 mol %), both N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine strongly 
217  suppressed CYP4F2-mediated docosanoic acid hydroxylation (87% inhibition by N-oleoyl-
218  leucine and 81% inhibition by N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, Fig. 4C).  In contrast, superstoichiometric 
219  levels (10-fold excess) of either N-acyl amino acid was required to observe similar levels of 
220  competition of 8-HETE hydroxylation (94% inhibition by N-oleoyl-leucine and 84% inhibition by 
221  N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, Fig. 4D).  
222  Conversely, we investigated if the canonical substrates arachidonic acid, docosanoic 
223  acid, and 8-HETE might also compete CYP4F2-catalyzed N-acyl amino acid hydroxylation.  
224  While arachidonic acid was able to compete N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine

225  hydroxylation by CYP4F2 (Fig. 4E), neither docosanoic acid nor 8-HETE exhibited strong 
226  inhibition of either N-oleoyl-leucine or N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, even at superstoichiometric levels 
227  (10:1 competitor:substrate, Fig. 4F-G).  We therefore conclude that N-oleoyl-leucine and N-
228  oleoyl-phenylalanine and other canonical substrates engage in bidirectional competition to 
229  regulate hydroxylation flux at the CYP4F2 enzyme node.  The different dose responses 
230  observed for competition between each substrate pair potentially reflects differences in effective 
231  concentrations and/or substrate affinities at the CYP4F2 active site.  
232   
233  Metabolic diversification of N-acyl amino acids downstream of CYP4F2 
234  CYP4F2-catalyzed substrate hydroxylation can result in either metabolic diversification 
235  (e.g., arachidonic acid to 20-HETE) or oxidative degradation (e.g., vitamin E). To determine 
236  which of these metabolic outcomes was the relevant pathway for the N-acyl amino acids, we 
237  used untargeted lipidomics in live cells to map the fate of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-
238  phenylalanine downstream of CYP4F2.  For these studies, we initially focused on N-oleoyl-
239  leucine.  First, CYP4F2 or mock transfected HEK293T cells were treated with N-oleoyl-leucine 
240  for 4 h.  Total intracellular lipids were extracted by the Folch method and differential peaks were 
241  identified using XCMS22 (Fig. 5A).  Two statistically significant peaks of high fold change 
242  (P<0.05, >20-fold) were enriched in cells overexpressing CYP4F2.  As expected, the top scoring 
243  peak of m/z = 410.3271 matched to ω-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine (expected m/z = 410.3276) (Fig. 
244  5B).  The second peak of mass m/z = 674.5718 was also highly enriched in CYP4F2-
245  transfected cells, but its chemical structure remained initially unknown.  The mass difference 
246  observed between the two peaks (264.2442) as well as the later retention time of the second 
247  peak was consistent with an additional lipidation by oleate (+C H O, expected +264.2453).  
18 32
248  We therefore hypothesized that this second peak represented an unusual and previously 
249  unknown very long chain fatty acid, oleic acid-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine (OAHOL).  We used 
250  chemical synthesis to generate authentic standards for both hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine and OAHOL

251  (see Methods).  As shown in Fig. 5C-D, fragmentation of both synthetic hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine 
252  and the endogenous m/z = 410.33 peak gave an identical daughter ion at m/z = 130.087, which 
253  matched the mass of the leucine anion.  In addition to demonstrating the existence of these 
254  metabolites in cell lysates we confirmed the presence of endogenous hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine in 
255  human plasma as well (Fig. 5C, lower panel).  Similarly, fragmentation of both synthetic 
256  OAHOL and the endogenous m/z = 674.57 mass gave daughter ions at m/z = 130.087 (leucine 
257  anion) and m/z = 281.249 (oleate).  We therefore conclude that m/z = 410.33 and m/z = 674.57 
258  correspond to hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine and OAHOL, respectively.  
259  OAHOL is a novel lipid metabolite that is not found in any public databases23,24.  This 
260  lipid metabolite is presumably formed by enzymatic acylation of hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine with 
261  oleoyl-CoAs.  Based on this metabolic pathway hypothesis, we manually examined our dataset 
262  for additional fatty acyl-derivatives of ω-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine. Beyond OAHOL, we also 
263  identified PAHOL (palmitic acid-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine) and SAHOL (stearic acid-hydroxy-
264  oleoyl-leucine) dramatically elevated in CYP4F2-transfected, but not mock-transfected cells 
265  (Fig. 5E and Supplemental Fig. 3A-B).  To determine if these very long chain lipid derivatives 
266  could also be formed downstream of CYP4F2-mediated hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-
267  phenylalanine, we performed similar untargeted experiments in live CYP4F2-transfected cells 
268  with N-oleoyl-phenylalanine as a substrate.  As shown in Fig. 5F, addition of N-oleoyl-
269  phenylalanine also resulted in the downstream production of ω-hydroxy-oleoyl-phenylalanine 
270  and oleoyl- and palmitoyl- conjugates of hydroxy-oleoyl-phenylalanine (oleic acid-hydroxy-
271  oleoyl-phenylalanine and palmitic acid-hydroxy-oleoyl-phenylalanine, respectively).  For N-
272  oleoyl-phenylalanine, the stearoyl acylation product was not detected.  Taken together, we 
273  conclude that CYP4F2-catalyzed hydroxylation of N-acyl amino acids leads to the metabolic 
274  diversification of a wide array of previously unknown lipids, including several very long chain 
275  lipids that structurally resemble previously reported anti-diabetic fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids 
276  (FAHFAs14, Supplemental Fig. 3C).

278  Discussion 
279  By integrating genetic and clinical data with circulating levels of plasma N-acyl amino 
280  acids from a large human cohort, our study provides several insights of potential importance into 
281  the regulation of N-acyl amino acids in humans. First, individual plasma N-acyl amino acid 
282  levels are associated with cardiometabolic disease endpoints independent of free amino acid 
283  plasma levels and in patterns according to the amino acid head group. Second, the underlying 
284  genetic architecture and biological pathways that may regulate plasma levels of N-acyl amino 
285  acids also differ according to the amino acid head group. Finally, CYP4F2 functions as a 
286  human-specific enzyme node that catalyzes the metabolic diversification of N-acyl amino acids 
287  into a much larger family of lipids with varying characteristics of the fatty acid tail group, 
288  including several that structurally resemble FAHFAs. 
289  Our large-scale human study revealed novel associations between the N-acyl amino 
290  acids and specific cardiometabolic diseases in participants of the JHS. Notably, we identified 
291  that the associations between fasting baseline levels of N-oleoyl-serine and future coronary 
292  heart disease, as well as N-oleoyl-leucine and future heart failure, were independent of the 
293  plasma levels of free serine and leucine, respectively. This suggests that these associations are 
294  driven by the intact N-acyl oleic acid conjugate of each amino acid, rather than levels of the free 
295  amino acid themselves. This may suggest that N-acyl amino acids affect cardiometabolic 
296  outcomes through distinct biological mechanisms from those mediated by circulating levels of 
297  the corresponding free amino acid.   
298  Interestingly, when analyzing associations of N-acyl-amino acids with prevalent 
299  cardiometabolic disease at baseline, we detected a bifurcation in associations according to 
300  amino acid head group, with N-oleoyl-glycine and serine associated with cardiometabolically 
301  “advantageous” traits (such as prevalent diabetes), and N-oleoyl-leucine and phenylalanine 
302  associated with “disadvantageous” cardiometabolic traits (such as obesity).  This division

303  mirrors positive associations between branched chain (e.g. leucine) and aromatic (e.g. 
304  phenylalanine) free amino acids with obesity and insulin resistance, and inverse associations 
305  between glycine and serine with impaired glucose tolerance and risk of diabetes25-33. The 
306  mechanisms linking these free amino acid species to cardiometabolic traits and risk of disease 
307  remain to be fully elucidated, but may involve various opposing effects on regulatory pathways 
308  upstream of pancreatic islet β-cell insulin secretion25,34-38.  Whether the N-oleoyl species of 
309  these amino acids – as well as the CYP4F2-mediated derivatives of these metabolites – act 
310  through the same or different pathways adds a potential additional layer of complexity to this 
311  regulatory balance.   
312  Our studies of human N-acyl amino acid metabolism highlight the utility of integrating 
313  metabolomic profiling data with genetic data for pathway discovery. In mice, FAAH and PM20D1 
314  are two major enzymes that catalyze the bidirectional N-acyl amino acid synthesis and 
315  hydrolysis from free amino acids and free fatty acids. Human-based studies have established 
316  FAAH as the primary degradative enzyme of the structurally-related N-acyl ethanolamines39.  
317  Therefore, the association between the FAAH locus and plasma levels of N-oleoyl-glycine and 
318  N-oleoyl-serine in participants of the JHS was expected. However, the absence of an 
319  association of N-acyl amino acids to the human PM20D1 locus, as well as the identification of 
320  the CYP4F2 gene as a novel and human-specific association, were both unexpected. We 
321  validated the novel genetic association between N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine 
322  with the CYP4F2 locus by demonstrating that these two N-acyl amino acids are both bona fide 
323  substrates and inhibitors of the human CYP4F2 enzyme in vitro and in cell-based models. The 
324  top association for both N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine was with a missense 
325  variant (chr19:15879621C>T; Val433Met) that has previously been shown to result in reduced 
326  CYP4F2 protein levels and enzymatic activity in cell-based model systems, but that has not 
327  previously been tied to N-acyl amino acid metabolism20,40,41. This variant is common with a

328  global MAF of 0.29 and a subgroup MAF of 0.09 in African Americans, as reported in the NCBI 
329  Allele Frequency Aggregator.     
330  While it is possible that our study did not detect an association between the PM20D1 
331  locus and N-acyl amino acids due to cohort-specific characteristics or sample size, we note that 
332  none of the measured N-acyl amino acids demonstrated even a modest association (nominal p-
333  value ≤ 0.001) with a genetic variant between the PM20D1 transcriptional start and end sites.  
334  This finding will require validation in additional cohorts, however may suggest that human 
335  PM20D1 controls local, and possibly tissue-specific extracellular paracrine pools of N-acyl 
336  amino acids that do not interact with the levels found in the circulation. 
337  It is notable that we detected very strong associations between the CYP4F2 locus on 
338  chromosome 19 and N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine with no appreciable 
339  association signals between this locus and either N-oleoyl-glycine or N-oleoyl-serine (p > 0.001 
340  for all variants between the CYP4F2 transcriptional start and end sites).  Importantly, the 
341  biochemical basis for this genetic specificity remains the subject of future study.  We have 
342  previously found that subcellular location, and even organ-specific substrate accessibility can 
343  contribute to the regulation of specific N-acyl amino acids by FAAH and PM20D14.  Future 
344  detailed enzymology studies of CYP4F2 may uncover additional fundamental biochemical 
345  characteristics of this enzyme that underlie these specific genetic associations. 
346  Our data suggest that CYP4F2 appears to be a key enzymatic node at the center of a 
347  complex lipid network that contains classical bioactive lipids, such as arachidonate and 20-
348  HETE, with more novel lipid species, including N-acyl amino acids, hydroxylated N-acyl amino 
349  acids, and very long chain fatty acyl derivatives of N-acyl amino acids that structurally resemble 
350  FAHFAs. Notably, we detect that examples of these, including hydroxylated oleoyl-leucine, are 
351  present in human plasma. Currently, the precise biochemical and functional relationship 
352  between all of these lipid species, especially in a complex tissue environment such as a human 
353  liver, remains unknown. For instance, it may be possible that hydroxy N-acyl amino acids exhibit

354  similar vasoactive effects as 20-HETE, and fatty acylated hydroxy-N-acyl amino acid derivatives 
355  might also function in a similar manner to that of the anti-diabetic FAHFAs. Alternatively, N-acyl 
356  amino acids may indirectly modulate the levels of other CYP4F2-regulated lipids via substrate 
357  competition. An important area of future work will be to understand the relative fluxes of each 
358  lipid class through CYP4F2 as well as the potential functional roles of these new N-acyl amino 
359  acid derivatives.  
360  The integration of human functional genomics with untargeted lipidomics studies of 
361  cultured cells further allowed for the discovery of a novel class of very long chain lipids. These 
362  compounds structurally resemble FAHFAs, although instead of containing a characteristic 
363  branched hydroxyl linkage, contain a terminal ester linkage between a fatty acid and a hydroxy 
364  N-acyl amino acid. A similar terminal linkage has been described in O-acyl-ω-hydroxy fatty 
365  acids (ωOAHFAs), however these unusual species have only recently been detected in human 
366  skin42 and meibum43, and not to our knowledge in human plasma. Further, we are not aware of 
367  a previous report of fatty acyl-derivatives of hydroxy N-acyl-amino acids. FAHFAs are a diverse 
368  family of bioactive lipids that have recently been shown to signal through specific G protein-
369  coupled receptors and other pathways to improve glucose-insulin homeostasis and block 
370  inflammatory cytokine production14. Our data provide new insights to this emerging class of 
371  molecules and raise the intriguing possibility that ω-hydroxy-oleoyl amino acid species may also 
372  serve as signaling effectors in human metabolism. 
373  Finally, we note that the CYP4F2 locus has been associated with several 
374  cardiometabolic phenotypes in large-scale, consortium-based GWAS meta-analyses, including 
375  blood total cholesterol levels (z-stat 5.24, p-value=8.1 x 10-8), LDL cholesterol levels (z-stat 
376  4.77, p-value=9.2 x 10-7), diastolic blood pressure levels (z-stat 3.75, p-value=8.8 x 10-5), and 
377  coronary artery disease in subjects without diabetes (z-stat 3.28, p-value=5.3 x 10-4)44. Notably, 
378  the rs2108622 variant, which results in the CYP4F2 V433M substitution that abrogates CYP4F2 
379  hydroxylation activity (Fig. 3D-E), is associated with several cardiometabolic phenotypes,

382  disease (OR 1.02, p=1.92x10-5)45.  How this locus contributes to these human phenotypes 
383  remains the subject of future investigations, and the link with N-acyl amino acid biology may 
384  provide new insight to these studies.

385  Methods 
386  Human Cohort 
387  JHS is a prospective population based observational study designed to investigate risk factors 
388  for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Black individuals, as previously described46. In 2000-2004, 
389  5306 Black individuals from the Jackson, Mississippi tri-county area (Hinds, Rankin and 
390  Madison counties) were recruited for a baseline examination.  Of the original cohort, 2351 
391  individuals had metabolomic profiling of N-acyl amino acids performed from baseline samples 
392  and were included in the analyses. Details in regard to the collection and calculation of clinical 
393  data included in Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 1 have been previously described13. All 
394  clinical data were collected during the baseline exam (Exam 1), except visceral adipose tissue 
395  (Exam 2), subcutaneous adipose tissue (Exam 2), coronary artery calcium score (Exam 2), and 
396  abdominal aorto-iliac calcium score (Exam 2). 
397   
398  Study Approval 
399  The Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the University of 
400  Mississippi Medical Center approved the human study protocols, and all participants provided 
401  written informed consent. 
402   
403  N-Acyl amino acid metabolite profiling in human plasma 
404  Methods for metabolomics profiling in human plasma have been described12. In brief, to 
405  measure N-oleoyl-leucine/phenylalanine/glycine/and serine, chromatography was performed 
406  using an Agilent 1290 infinity LC system equipped with a Waters XBridge Amide column, 
407  coupled to an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. To measure endogenous 
408  hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine, chromatography was performed using a Waters UPLC BEH Amide 
409  (1.7um, 1.0x150mm) column. Metabolite transitions were assayed using a dynamic multiple 
410  reaction monitoring system. LC-MS data were analyzed with Agilent Masshunter QQQ

411  Quantitative analysis software. Isotope labeled internal standards were monitored in each 
412  sample to ensure proper MS sensitivity for quality control. Pooled plasma samples were 
413  interspersed at intervals of ten participant samples to enable correction of drift in instrument 
414  sensitivity over time and to scale data between batches. A linear scaling approach was used to 
415  the nearest pooled plasma sample in the queue. 
416   
417  Genotyping 
418  Whole genome sequencing (WGS) in JHS has been described47. Briefly, participant samples 
419  underwent >30× WGS through the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project at the Northwest 
420  Genome Center at University of Washington and joint genotype calling with participants in 
421  Freeze 6; genotype calling was performed by the Informatics Resource Center at the University 
422  of Michigan.

424  Whole Genome Association Studies  
425  Summary statistics from whole genome association studies of metabolite levels in plasma 
426  samples of participants of the JHS are available on the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue 
427  (Accession GCP000239)15 and GWAS methods have been previously described16. Briefly, 
428  metabolite LC-MS peak areas were log-transformed and scaled to a mean of zero and standard 
429  deviation of 1 and subsequently residualized on age, sex, batch, and principal components 
430  (PCs) of ancestry 1-10 as determined by the GENetic EStimation and Inference in Structured 
431  samples (GENESIS)48, and subsequently inverse normalized. The association between these 
432  values and genetic variants was tested using linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, 
433  the genetic relationship matrix, and PCs 1-10 using the fastGWA model implemented in the 
434  GCTA software package49.  Variants with a minor allele count less than 5 in JHS were excluded 
435  from analysis.

493  temperature. After removal of the solvent, the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate (EtOAc); 
494  washed with KHSO4, brine, NaHCO3, and brine; and then concentrated under reduced 
495  pressure. The crude ester was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and 2 N of LiOH was added. The 
496  resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction was acidified to pH 2-3 
497  by the addition of 1 M of HCl and then extracted with DCM and concentrated. The resulting 
498  crude product was used directly for LC-MS/MS analysis.   
499   
500  Synthesis of oleic acid-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine. To a solution of oleic acid in dichloromethane 
501  (DCM) was added oxalyl chloride (one drop) and one drop of DMF at 0 C. The mixture was 
502  stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The mixture was concentrated and dissolved in DCM 
503  then added to a suspension of ω-hydroxy-oleoyl-leucine and DIPEA (1 drop) in DCM. The 
504  reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours then acidified to pH 4 with 1 M 
505  HCl. The resulting mixture was extracted with DCM and washed with brine then the solvent was 
506  removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was analyzed directly by LC-MS/MS.

508  Lipid analysis by LC-MS/MS in cell culture samples. To acquire tandem mass (MS2) spectra for 
509  N-oleoyl-leucine and its derivatives, lipid samples were first dried by a SpeedVac and then 
510  reconstituted in acetonitrile:isopropanol:water mixture at a ratio of 13:6:1 (v/v/v). Samples were 
511  injected at 4µL into an Acsentis Express C18 2.7 µm HPLC column (L × I.D. 15 cm × 2.1 mm, 
512  Millipore Sigma 53825-U) preceded by an Acsentis Express C18 2.7 µm guard column (5 x 2.1 
513  mm guard (L × I.D. 5 mm × 2.1 mm, Millipore Sigma 53501-U). Flow rate was set to a constant 
514  rate 0.26 mL/min. Additional chromatographic details are as follow:  
515  Mobile phases: A, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in 60% and 40 water and 
516  acetonitrile, respectively; B, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in 90% and 10%

(A) Age- and sex-adjusted associations between plasma levels of N-oleoyl-serine and future risk 
of coronary heart disease13 (top) and N-oleoyl-leucine and future risk of heart failure12 (bottom) 
in JHS were unaffected by further adjustment for circulating levels of the corresponding free 
amino acid using cox regression models.  (B) The relationship between plasma levels of each 
N-acyl amino acid (log transformed and standardized) and cardiometabolic traits (standardized) 
was analyzed using age- and sex-adjusted mixed linear regression models for continuous 
variables measured in the JHS (top) and age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models for 
categorical variables in the JHS (bottom). Estimated beta coefficients are represented by a color 
scale from red to blue (red represents positive and blue represents negative association). The 
area of each node corresponds to -log10(p-values). Bonferroni-adjusted P-value = 6.0x10-4 
(0.05/21 tested traits/4 analytes).

(A) Circulating levels of N-oleoyl-glycine and serine in plasma samples from participants from 
the Jackson Heart Study were associated with the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) locus on 
chromosome 1, whereas levels of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine were associated 
with the Cytochrome P450 Family 4 Subfamily F Member 2 (CYP4F2) locus on chromosome 
19.  Manhattan plots represent the location of each genetic variant across each chromosome 
(alternating colors; chromosomes 1 and 19 labeled) along the x-axis with the statistical 
significance of association with the measured metabolite on the y-axis.  The genome-wide level 
of statistical significance (p=5x10-8) is marked with a red dashed line. (B) Locuszoom plots of
