ABSTRACT 
31 
32  C/EBP  homologous  protein  (CHOP),  also  known  as  DNA  damage-inducible  transcript  3 
33  (DDIT3), is a member of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family. The expression of 
34  CHOP is upregulated during unfolded protein response (UPR), and sustained CHOP activity 
35  plays an important role in UPR-induced apoptosis. MicroRNA-616 is localized in an intron of 
36  the CHOP gene. However, regulation of miR-616 expression during UPR and its function in 
37  breast cancer is not clearly understood. We show that miR-5p/-3p arms of miR-616 are 
38  expressed  with  levels  of  5p  arm  higher  than  3p  arm.  During  conditions  of  UPR,  the 
39  expression  of  miR-5p  and  miR-3p  arms  of  miR-616  and  its  host  gene  (CHOP)  was 
40  concordantly  increased  primarily  in  a  PERK-dependent  manner.  We  show  that  ectopic 
41  expression of miR-616 significantly suppressed cell growth and colony formation, whereas 
42  knockout of miR-616 increased it. We identified that MYC proto-oncogene (c-MYC) gene is 
43  repressed during the UPR and targeted by miR-616. Further, we show that expression of 
44  miR-616 and CHOP is downregulated in human breast cancer, where expression of miR-616 
45  was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in luminal A subtype and better OS HER2 
46  subtype of breast cancer. In summary, our results suggest a dual function for the DDIT3 
47  locus, where CHOP protein and miR-616 can co-operate to regulate cancer progression.

INTRODUCTION 
56 
57  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial cellular organelle that plays important role in 
58  folding and maturation of proteins that transit through the secretory pathway. Stimuli that 
59  compromise the protein handling capacity of the ER activate an evolutionarily conserved 
60  pathway known as unfolded protein response (UPR). Three major sensor molecules that 
61  initiate the UPR are activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α 
62  (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (1). During resting 
63  state the activity of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 is kept under control by interaction with ER 
64  chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78); however, upon accumulation of misfolded 
65  proteins in ER, GRP78 dissociates from these molecules, leading to their activation (2). Upon 
66  dissociation  with  GRP78,  IRE1  auto-phosphorylates  and  oligomerizes  leading  to  the 
67  activation of its endoribonuclease domain present in the cytosolic domain. Active IRE1 
68  catalyses the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA and regulated IRE1-dependent decay of 
69  transcripts (RIDD) (3). While splicing of XBP1 mRNA is an adaptive response to UPR, RIDD 
70  has many context dependent outcomes (3). ATF6 is a transmembrane protein located in the 
71  ER membrane with an N-terminus cytoplasmic domain containing a DNA-binding motif and 
72  a C-terminus ER-luminal domain that interacts with GRP78 (4). During UPR, ATF6 is relocates 
73  from the ER to the Golgi compartment. In the Golgi, ATF6 is processed by intramembranous 
74  proteolysis causing the release of the transcriptionally active N-terminal cytosolic domain, 
75  p50ATF6 (5). During UPR, active PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), 
76  causing reduced translation initiation for a majority of cellular proteins and preferential 
77  translation of a subset of mRNAs including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (6, 7). 
78  Phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to general translational block and preferential translation of

79  a subset of mRNAs including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (7). Phosphorylation of 
80  NRF2 by PERK attenuates Keap1-mediated degradation of NRF2 and promotes expression of 
81  NRF2-target genes through the antioxidant response elements (ARE) (6). The increased 
82  protein handling capacity of the ER and degradation of unfolded proteins induced by UPR 
83  attempts to restore the protein homeostasis and increase cell survival. However, if UPR-
84  induced mechanisms fail to alleviate ER stress, UPR activates apoptosis.  
85   
86  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~20–23 nucleotide) single-stranded RNA molecules that 
87  regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner (8). The increased expression of 
88  miR-616 has been reported in androgen-independent prostate cancer (9, 10), gastric cancer 
89  (11), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (12), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  (13) and 
90  gliomas (14). MiR-616 targets tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-2) in prostate cancer (9); 
91  PTEN in HCC and gastric cancer (15); SOX7 in glioma and NSCLC (14). However, miR-616-3p 
92  has been reported to reduce XIAP expression and potentiate apoptosis in HUVECs (16). 
93  LINC01614 promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression via PI3K/AKT 
94  signalling  pathway  and  miR-616-3p  can  inhibit  cancer  progression  by  downregulating 
95  LINC01614 expression (17). Ye et al. reported that miR-616-3p inhibited cell growth and 
96  mammosphere  formation  of  breast  cancer  cells  by  suppressing  GLI1  (18),  while  Yuan 
97  reported that miR-616-3p promoted breast cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting 
98  TIMP2 and regulating MMP signalling (19). Overall, these observations suggest that miR-616 
99  exhibits  both  oncogenic  and  tumour  suppressor  functions  in  context-  and/or  tissue-
100  dependent manner. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate the role of miR-
101  616 in human cancers.

103  During the past few years, work from several groups has revealed that all three branches of 
104  the UPR regulate specific subsets of miRNAs (20, 21, 22, 23). The modes of regulation 
105  include both increase and decrease in expression by UPR-regulated transcription factors 
106  such as ATF6, XBP1, ATF4 and NRF2 as well as degradation by RIDD activity. The key feature 
107  of UPR-dependent miRNA expression is fine tuning of the ER homeostasis to modulate 
108  cellular adaptation to stress and regulation of cell fate. The gene encoding miRNA-616 is 
109  located in the second intron of CHOP/DDIT3. This genomic co-location of miR-616 with 
110  CHOP/DDIT3 suggests a role for miR-616 in UPR. Indeed, increased expression of miR-616 
111  has been reported during conditions of UPR (24, 25). Hiramatsu et al., focused on the 
112  expression of miR-616-5p  (24) while Arabkari focused on the expression of miR-616-3p (25). 
113  Here we have evaluated the expression of both miR-5p/-3p arms of miR-616 as well its host 
114  gene (CHOP) during conditions of UPR. 
115   
116  We show that expression level of miR-616-5p was higher than miR-616-3p in human cancer 
117  cells and tissues. During conditions of UPR, the expression of both miR-5p/-3p arms of miR-
118  616 and CHOP was increased in a PERK-dependent manner. Our results show that miR-616 
119  regulates cell  growth and proliferation along with regulation of c-MYC expression. We 
120  identified that MYC proto-oncogene (MYC) gene is repressed during the UPR and targeted 
121  by miR-616. Finally, we show that expression of miR-616 and CHOP (host gene of miR-616) 
122  is  reduced  in  human  breast cancer.  In summary,  our  results  suggest that  CHOP  locus 
123  generates  two  gene  products,  where  CHOP  protein  and  miR-616  can  act  together  to 
124  regulate cancer progression.

Results  
188 
Expression of miR-616-5p is higher than miR-616-3p  
189 
190  Several miRNAs are located within the introns of either protein coding or non-coding genes, 
191  and are referred to as intronic miRNAs (27). The genes which harbour these miRNAs are 
192  embedded are called host genes. MiR-616 is an intronic miRNA localized in the first intron of 
193  DDIT3 gene (Fig 1A). Both the 5’ and 3’ arms of the precursor duplex can generate mature 
194  miRNAs,  and  are  referred  to  as  miRNA-5p  and  -3p  (27,  28).  The  miRBase 
195  (http://www.mirbase.org) (29) has discontinued the use of miRNA/miRNA* nomenclature 
196  and use of miR-5p and miR-3p nomenclature (30), based solely on 5’- or 3’-arm derivation of

197  the mature miRNA is now recommended. The sequences of mature miR-616, accession 
198  numbers  and  the  previous  names  of  miR-616-5p  and  -3p  as  per  miRNA/miRNA* 
199  nomenclature are shown in Fig 1B. Indeed, both 5p and 3p arms of miR-616 have been 
200  shown to be expressed in human cancers (11, 31). Next we evaluated the expression of miR-
201  616-5p and miR-616-3p in human cancers. Initially expression of miR-616-5p and miR-616-
202  3p was determined in various human cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. We observed that 
203  endogenous expression of miR-616-5p was higher than miR-616-3p in all the cell lines tested 
204  (Fig 1C). Next we analysed the expression of miR-616-5p and miR-616-3p in the TCGA 
205  dataset from different human cancers using OncomiR (http://www.oncomir.org), a web-
206  based tool for miRNA expression analysis. We observed a higher expression of miR-616-5p 
207  as compared to miR-616-3p in all the cancer types evaluated (Fig 2). Of note the ratio of 
208  miR-616-5p  and  miR-616-3p  expression  varied  considerably  across  the  different  tissue 
209  types. These results suggest that both 5p and 3p arms of miR-616 are expressed where miR-
210  616-5p accumulates at higher levels than miR-616-3p but their ratio is controlled in tissue-
211  specific manner.

Increased expression of miR-616-5p and miR-616-3p during UPR 
242 
243  It was initially proposed that intronic miRNAs are derived from the same primary transcript 
244  as  their  host genes  thereby  leading  to  co-expression  and co-regulation  of  miRNA  and 
245  cognate host gene (27). Analysis of expression of 175 miRNAs and their host genes across 
246  twenty four different human organs reported a significantly correlated expression profile 
247  (32). Recent evidence however, shows significant discordant expression between intronic 
248  miRNAs and host genes. Two likely explanations for this discordant expression are:  (i) 
249  miRNAs have their own independent promoters and (ii) crosstalk between microprocessor 
250  cleavage and mRNA splicing (33, 34). Next, we evaluated the co-regulation of miR-616 and 
251  its host gene (CHOP) during conditions of UPR. MCF7, BT474 and HCT116 cells were either 
252  treated or untreated with thapsigargin (TG) or Brefeldin A (BFA) for 24 hours and expression 
253  of CHOP, miR-616-5p and miR-616-3p was determined. The expression level of CHOP, miR-
254  616-5p and miR-616-3p was upregulated in all three cell lines tested, during ER stress (Fig. 
255  3A-C). Next we investigated the role of ATF6, PERK and IRE1, three key mediators of the UPR 
256  in upregulation of miR-616 expression. For this purpose, we used MCF7 control (MCF7 
257  PLKO) and knockdown of UPR  sensors (MCF7 XBP1-KD, MCF7 PERK-KD and MCF7 ATF6-KD) 
258  sub-clones of MCF7 (35). We found that BFA-induced increase in the expression of CHOP,

259  pri-miR-616, miR-616-5p and miR-616-3p was attenuated in PERK-knockdown sub-clones of 
260  MCF7 (Fig 4A), whereas knockdown of ATF6 or XBP1 had no significant effect (Fig 4B-C). 
261  These results suggest that miR-616 is co-transcribed along with the CHOP transcript and 
262  attenuated PERK signalling compromised the induction of CHOP mRNA, pri-miR-616, miR-

MiR-616 targets c-MYC and reduces cell proliferation of breast cancer cells 
279 
280  Ye et al. reported that ectopic expression of miR-616-3p inhibited growth of MDA-MB231 
281  cells while Arabkari did not find any effect of miR-616 overexpression in MDA-MB231 cells 
282  (18) (25). Further, Yuan reported that miR-616-3p promoted growth and migration of MCF7 
283  cells in contrast to Arabkari, who reported a decrease in growth and migration of miR-616 
284  expressing  MCF7  cells    (19)  (25). This could  be  due  to  different  approaches  used  for 
285  overexpression of miRNAs. Next, we used gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss-of-
286  function (CRISPR-Cas9 KO) approaches in MCF7 cells to study the role of miR-616 in breast 
287  cancer. To better mimic the in vivo scenario we decided to use a lentiviral system for 
288  modulating the expression of both miR-616-5p and -3p concurrently. For this purpose,

289  MCF7 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing GFP along with miR-616 or Cas-9 
290  along with gRNAs targeting miR-616. The expression of pri-miR-616, miR-616-5p and miR-
291  616-3p  was  determined  in  miR-616-overexpressing  (MCF7-miR-616-OE)  and  miR-616-
292  knockout (MCF7-miR-616-KO) sub-clones of MCF7. As expected, the levels of pri-miR-616, 
293  miR-616-5p and miR-616-3p were increased in MCF7-miR-616-OE sub-clone (Fig. 5A) and 
294  decreased  in  MCF7-miR-616-KO  sub-clone  (Fig.  5E).  The  MCF7-miR-616-KO  sub-clone 
295  displayed hypomorphic phenotype with partial reduction in expression of pri-miR-616, miR-
296  616-5p and miR-616-3p. The miR-616 overexpressing (MCF7-miR-616-OE) sub-clone showed 
297  significantly decreased cell growth (Fig. 5B), while the miR-616 knockout (MCF7-miR-616-
298  KO) sub-clone showed increased cell growth (Fig. 5F). This observation was further validated 
299  by colony formation assay. The miR-616 overexpressing (MCF7-miR-616-OE) sub-clone of 
300  MCF7 cells showed decrease in the number and size of the colonies (Fig. 5C-D) but miR-616 
301  knockout (MCF7-miR-616-KO) sub-clone showed an increase in the number and size of the 
302  colonies (Fig. 5G-H).  We found that expression of c-MYC mRNA and protein was reduced 
303  miR-616 overexpressing (MCF7-miR-616-OE) sub-clone of MCF7 cells (Fig. 6 A and C) and 
304  increased in miR-616 knockout (MCF7-miR-616-KO) sub-clone (Fig. 6 B and C). Our results 
305  are in agreement with an earlier report where ectopic expression of miR-616 was shown to 
306  inhibit growth of MCF7 cells accompanied by reduced expression of c-MYC (25). Since an 
307  inverse  relationship  between  the  levels  of  expression  of  a  miRNA  and  its  target  is 
308  anticipated, we evaluated expression of c-MYC during conditions of UPR. We found the 
309  expression of c-MYC mRNA was decreased in MCF7 (Fig. 7A) and BT474 (Fig. 7B) cells 
310  treated either with TG or BFA. Furthermore, expression of c-MYC protein was decreased in 
311  MCF7 and BT474 cells upon treatment with BFA (Fig. 7C). These results suggest a role for 
312  miR-616 in regulation of c-MYC expression during conditions of UPR.

351  picked an identical, non-canonical miR-616-3p binding site in the protein-coding region 
352  (364-1728 bp) of c-MYC at position 1525 bp (Fig. 8A-B). To test whether miR-616 down-
353  regulates  c-MYC  via  this  site  in  coding  region,  we  co-transfected  293T  cells  with  an 
354  expression vector containing the ORF of c-MYC and miR-616 plasmid. Cell lysates were 
355  collected after 24 h and  analysed by immunoblotting. Our results showed that c-MYC 
356  protein level was strongly down-regulated by co-expression of miR-616 (Fig. 8C). Under 
357  similar conditions, co-expression of miR-616 had no effect on protein level of ERα (protein 
358  coding region of ERα has no predicted binding sites for miR-616) (Fig. 8D). Further, co-
359  expression of miR-4726 (miRNA that lacks binding sites in the protein coding region of c-
360  MYC) and c-MYC had no effect on c-MYC protein level (Fig. 8E). Taken together these results 
361  suggest  that  miR-616  regulates  the  expression  of  c-MYC  most  likely  via  the  miR-616 
362  response elements present in its protein coding region.

382  used TNMplot to determine the expression of CHOP and miR-616 in normal and tumour 
383  tissue samples of breast. We found that expression of CHOP and miR-616 was reduced in 
384  tumour samples as compared to tumour adjacent normal tissue (Fig 9A-B). Further, the 
385  expression of miR-616 was associated with poor OS in luminal A subtype and better OS 
386  HER2 subtype of breast cancer (Fig 9C).

DISCUSSION 
395 
396  MiRNAs regulate the wide range of cellular processes because of their ability to alter post-
397  transcriptional gene expression (37). We have evaluated the role of UPR regulated miRNA-
398  616 in cell growth and proliferation. We have shown that expression of miR-616 and its host 
399  gene (CHOP) is upregulated during ER stress in a PERK-dependent fashion (Fig 4). ER stress 
400  and UPR activation contributes to the initiation and progression of human diseases, such as 
401  cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease (2, 38). We observed concordant 
402  expression of the CHOP and the mature miR-616 which suggests their transcriptional co-
403  regulation (Fig 3, 4).   Our results suggest a mechanism for increased expression of miR-616 
404  in patho-physiological conditions where role of UPR is implicated.

406  Several studies have reported that miR-616 acts as a tumour promoting miRNA in human 
407  cancers (11, 31, 39). However, our results show that miR-616 expression attenuates the 
408  proliferation of MCF7 cells while reduced expression of miR-616 increases it (Fig 5). 
409  Furthermore, we observed that expression of miR-616 was reduced in human breast 
410  cancers as compared to tumour adjacent normal tissue (Fig 9). In agreement with our 
411  results miR-616-3p has been shown to potentiate apoptosis in HUVECs (16),  inhibit head 
412  and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression (17) and inhibit cell growth and 
413  mammosphere formation of breast cancer cells (18, 25).  Any small RNA having G-rich 6mer 
414  seed sequence (nt 2-7 of the guide strand) can reduce viability of cells when associated with 
415  RNA-induced silencing complex. G-rich seed sequence mediates toxicity by targeting C-rich 
416  seed matches in the 3] UTR of genes critical for cell survival referred to as Death Induced by 
417  Survival gene Elimination (DISE) (30). A systematic study to evaluate DISE activity of all 4096 
418  possible 6mer seed sequences in six cell lines (three human and three mouse) revealed the 
419  mechanism underlying this toxicity and a web-based algorithm (https://6merdb.org) can 
420  predict the activity of an RNA with a known 6mer seed (40). Analysis of seed sequences 
421  from both 5p and 3p strands of miR-616 revealed that both strands can exhibit opposing 
422  effects on viability in a cell-type dependent manner (S3 Fig). Interestingly, several miRNAs 
423  belonging to miR-371-373 Cluster (hsa-miR-371a-5p, hsa-miR-371b-5p, hsa-miR-372-5p and 
424  hsa-miR-373-5p) that share seed sequence with miR-616-5p, have been shown to reduce 
425  the progression and metastasis of colon cancer (41) as well as induction of cell cycle arrest 
426  (42). Taken together, these observations indicate the presence of context-dependent 
427  oncogenic and tumour suppressive effects of miR-616 in human cancers. Indeed context-
428  dependent tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressive role has been documented for 
429  several miRNAs such as miR-17-92 cluster (43, 44). This cluster maps to a region frequently

430  amplified in Burkitt’s lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and 
431  lung cancer (26, 43). The expression of miR-17-92 is reduced in prostate cancer (17)  and 
432  miR-17-92 expression in intestinal epithelial cells inhibited colon cancer progression by 
433  suppressing tumour angiogenesis (17).  
434   
435  Studies on target recognition by miRNAs have shown that sequence complementarity at the 
436  5' end of the miRNA, the so-called "seed region" at positions 2 to 7, is a main determinant 
437  for target recognition (36). However, a perfect seed match of its own is not a good predictor 
438  for miRNA regulation and a number of studies have shown that miRNA can regulate the 
439  expression of target genes via the sites with a G: U wobble and/or mismatch in the seed 
440  region (36). Further, a study using a cross-linking and immunoprecipitation method to 
441  experimentally identify microRNA target sites in an unbiased manner has reported a 
442  significant number of non-canonical sites (45, 46). Hence, presence of perfect seed 
443  complementarity is not essential for regulation of target genes by miRNA. In addition, target 
444  sites for endogenous miRNAs have been reported in ORFs and 5] UTRs, but they are less 
445  frequent than those in the 3’ UTR (47, 48). We found a non-canonical miR-616-3p binding 
446  site in the protein coding region of c-MYC transcript (Fig 8). Several studies have reported 
447  the presence of miRNA-binding sites in the protein coding sequence of the genes. Indeed 
448  miRNAs have been shown to regulate embryonic stem cell differentiation, DNA methylation, 
449  regulation of apoptosis, aortic development, and tumour suppression via the functional 
450  miRNA-binding sites in the protein coding sequence of the target genes (47, 48, 49). Several 
451  studies have reported the upregulation of c-MYC in different cancer cells and tumours such 
452  as neuroblastomas, lung, and breast cancer (50). The expression of c-MYC was 
453  downregulated in miR-616 expressing and upregulated in miR-616 knockout MCF7 cells (Fig

454  6). These observations suggest that effects of miR-616 on cell growth are primarily mediated 
455  by downregulation of c-MYC.  
456   
457  PERK has been shown to act as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor, where the nature of 
458  its function is determined by gene dose (51, 52). Transient pause in protein synthesis due to 
459  eIF2α  phosphorylation  by  PERK  is  beneficial  by  reducing  secretory  load  in  the  ER. 
460  Phosphorylation of NRF2 by PERK attenuates Keap1-mediated degradation of NRF2 and 
461  promotes expression of anti-oxidant enzymes through the antioxidant response elements 
462  (53, 54). PERK signalling can upregulate the CHOP/DDIT3 transcription factor, which inhibits 
463  expression of the gene encoding anti-apoptotic BCL-2 to hasten cell death, in addition to 
464  enhancing the expression of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 members such as BIM (54). Studies in both 
465  cellular and animal models with CHOP gene deficiency have shed light on the pro-apoptotic 
466  role of CHOP during cellular stress (54). Further, ectopic expression of CHOP was reported to 
467  induce a G1 cell cycle arrest (55). CHOP maintains the integrity of the human hematopoietic 
468  stem cell (HSC) pool by eliminating HSCs harbouring oncogenic mutations, and decrease the 
469  risk  of  leukaemia.  CHOP  induction  triggers  apoptosis  of  premalignant  cells  to  prevent 
470  malignant progression in a mouse lung cancer model. Hepatocyte-specific CHOP ablation 
471  increased  tumourigenesis  in  high  fat  diet-induced  steatohepatitis  and  Hepatocellular 
472  carcinoma (56, 57). CHOP has been shown to promote cancer progression, when fused with 
473  FUS/TLS or EWS protein by genomic rearrangement (58, 59). The FUS-CHOP oncoprotein has 
474  been shown to induce metastasis in in vivo model of sarcoma (58). Accumulating data 
475  suggest that CHOP impinges upon several aspects of cancer including initiation as well as 
476  progression of tumours (54). Our results show that miR-616 supressed cell growth of cancer 
477  cells through suppressing c-MYC expression. Our results establish a new and unexpected
