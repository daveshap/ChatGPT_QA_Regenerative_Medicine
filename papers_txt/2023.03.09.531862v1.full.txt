33  Abstract 
34   
35  SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated extraordinary ability to evade antibody immunity by 
36  antigenic drift. Small molecule drugs may provide effective therapy while being part of a 
37  solution to circumvent SARS-CoV-2 immune escape. In this study we report an α-ketoamide 
38  based peptidomimetic inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), RAY1216. Enzyme 
39  inhibition kinetic analysis established that RAY1216 is a slow-tight inhibitor with a Ki of 8.6 
40  nM; RAY1216 has a drug-target residence time of 104 min compared to 9 min of PF-
41  07321332 (nirmatrelvir), the antiviral component in Paxlovid, suggesting that RAY1216 is 
42  approximately 12 times slower to dissociate from the protease-inhibitor complex compared to 
43  PF-07321332. Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro:RAY1216 complex demonstrates that 
44  RAY1216 is covalently attached to the catalytic Cys145 through the α-ketoamide warhead; 
45  more extensive interactions are identified between bound RAY1216 and Mpro active site 
46  compared to PF-07321332, consistent with a more stable acyl-enzyme inhibition complex for 
47  RAY1216. In cell culture and human ACE2 transgenic mouse models, RAY1216 
48  demonstrates comparable antiviral activities towards different SARS-CoV-2 virus variants 
49  compared to PF-07321332. Improvement in pharmacokinetics has been observed for 
50  RAY1216 over PF-07321332 in various animal models, which may allow RAY1216 to be 
51  used without ritonavir. RAY1216 is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials 
52  (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05620160) to test real-world therapeutic efficacy 
53  against COVID-19.

55  Introduction 
56   
57  SARS-CoV-2 has become established in the human population through the coronavirus 
58  disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and is likely to remain in circulation. Owing to 
59  multinational efforts, vaccines were rapidly rolled out in the early stage of the pandemic and 
60  proved successful in saving lives. However, likely due to population immune pressures 
61  established by infections and vaccinations, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants with highly 
62  mutated spike proteins quickly emerged (Tian et al., 2022). Rapid emergence of highly 
63  mutated variants has demonstrated the virus's extraordinary capacity to escape humoral 
64  immunity, representing a great challenge to vaccines and therapeutic antibodies (Cox et al., 
65  2022; Harvey et al., 2021). 
66   
67  A number of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics have been developed (Fenton 
68  and Keam, 2022). This therapeutic strategy may be part of a solution to combat SARS-CoV-2 
69  immune escape. Of note, the orally available drugs molnupiravir and Paxlovid have been 
70  approved for COVID-19 treatment after being validated through clinical trials. Molnupiravir 
71  (LAGEVRIO, also known as EIDD-2801) is a prodrug of N-hydroxycytidine; this mutagenic 
72  ribonucleoside is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent targeting the viral RNA polymerase by 
73  lethal mutagenesis. However, this molecule has also been shown to be mutagenic to the host 
74  (Zhou et al., 2021). Paxlovid is a combination of PF-07321332 (nirmatrelvir) and ritonavir. 
75  PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic that selectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 
76  (Mpro, also known as 3C-like (3CL) protease) (Owen et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022), while 
77  ritonavir is a cytochrome P450 inhibitor that functions to slow down cytochrome P450-
78  mediated metabolism of PF-07321332 to improve bioavailability. However, the usage of 
79  ritonavir limits the clinical application range of Paxlovid due to the drug-drug interaction, 
80  which may cause potential safety issues. Therefore, our original goal is to aim for a drug 
81  candidate endowed with a longer half-life while maintaining good enzyme inhibitory potency 
82  as demonstrated by PF-07321332. We expect that such a newly designed Mpro inhibitor may 
83  possess prolonged pharmacokinetic stability in human, which can hopefully avoid the usage 
84  of ritonavir. The drug target of PF-07321332, Mpro, plays a role in the viral polyprotein pp1a 
85  and pp1ab processing that is essential in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). 
86  The Mpro gene has been observed to be relatively conserved among various SARS-CoV-2 
87  variants, therefore Mpro represents a promising target for drug development for SARS-CoV-2.

89  Other than PF-07321332, multiple series of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have been 
90  developed or discovered (Boras et al., 2021; Breidenbach et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2020; 
91  Drayman et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2020; Kitamura et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2020; 
92  Ma et al., 2021; Owen et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2021; Quan et al., 2022; Unoh et al., 2022; 
93  Zaidman et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b). With a few exceptions 
94  (Breidenbach et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2020; Unoh et al., 2022; Zaidman et al., 
95  2021), the majority of these molecules are peptidomimetics which often exhibit poor 
96  pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In this study, we report a further peptidomimetic Mpro 
97  inhibitor - RAY1216 currently in phase III clinical trial. Inspired by the successful HCV 
98  protease inhibitor discovery program reported for telaprevir (Chen and Tan, 2005; Kwong et 
99  al., 2011; Yip et al., 2004a; Yip et al., 2004b), RAY1216 was developed to feature an α-
100  ketoamide warhead and incorporates chemical moieties known to confer selectivity towards 
101  coronavirus Mpro. Here we characterize in detail the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition 
102  by RAY1216 and determine the crystal structure of the covalent adduct with SARS-CoV-2 
103  Mpro. Further, the antiviral activity, protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants in animal 
104  models, and PK properties are reported, and compared to those of PF-07321332. 
105   
106  Structure of RAY1216  
107   
108  RAY1216 (Fig. 1) was developed via multiple rounds of optimization conducted at P1, 
109  P2, P3, and P4 moieties and finally the covalent warhead was changed from nitrile to α-
110  ketoamide moiety. The details of the structure–activity relationship (SAR) optimizations will 
111  be further disclosed in a separate report. RAY1216 was chemically synthesized (Fig. S1) and 
112  the identity of the product is confirmed by NMR (Fig. S2-S4). The inhibitor features a 
113  cyclopentyl substituted a-ketoamide warhead, a pyroglutamine with a pyrrolidinone 
114  sidechain at P1 (this moiety is known to mimic glutamine, which dominates in the P1 
115  position of coronavirus Mpro recognition sequences (Xiong et al., 2021)), a P2 
116  cyclopentylproline, a P3 cyclohexylglycine and a P4 tri-fluoroacetamide (Fig. 1). The 
117  absolute configuration of synthesized RAY1216 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography 
118  (Fig. S5). 
119   
120  In vitro inhibition of Mpro by RAY1216 compared to PF-07321332 
121   
122  We used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based peptide cleavage assay 
123  (Grum-Tokars et al., 2008) to monitor SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity (Fig. S6-7) and we

124  estimated a K  of 31 μM and a k  of 0.12 s−1 for Mpro (Fig. S6-8 and Table S2-S3). To 
M cat
125  compare inhibition by RAY1216 and PF-07321332, Mpro (final concentration 80 nM as 
126  determined by the Bradford assay) was added to a solution of substrate (20 μM) and inhibitor 
127  (maximum concentration 444 nM, 2:3 dilution series down to 17 nM) in the assay buffer. The 
128  increase in fluorescence intensity was monitored in real time over a period of one hour. 
129  Representative replicates for RAY1216 or PF-07321332 are shown in Fig. 2 (also see Fig. S8 
130  and S9). Both compounds displayed a gradual onset of inhibitory activity; an initial relatively 
131  uninhibited phase in product formation is followed by a gradual approach to pseudo-
132  equilibrium (“slow binding” inhibition (Morrison, 1982; Morrison and Walsh, 1988)). 
133  Compound concentrations significantly lower than the nominal enzyme concentration caused 
134  a prominent inhibitory effect (“tight binding” inhibition (Cha, 1975; 1976; Cha et al., 1975)). 
135  The time course of the assay in the absence of inhibitors ([I] = 0) was markedly nonlinear due 
136  to substrate depletion. Under these particular experimental conditions, the classic algebraic 
137  “k ” methods of enzyme kinetic analysis (Copeland, 2013) cannot be utilized. Instead, 
obs
138  combined progress curves obtained at various inhibitor concentrations were fit globally to a 
139  system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) solved by the software package 
140  DynaFit (Kuzmic, 1996; 2009). 
141  The data vs. model overlay plots in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b illustrate that the overall 
142  inhibitory potencies of RAY1216 and PF-07321332 are very similar. Note that at the three 
143  highest inhibitor concentrations ([I] = 444, 296, and 198 nM) the reaction progress curves 
144  become nearly horizontal at the end of the assay both in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. However, also 
145  note that the approach to the quasi steady-state is markedly slower for RAY1216 when 
146  compared with PF-07321332. This fundamental difference between the two compounds is 
147  made most clearly visible in the instantaneous rate plots shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, 
148  respectively. For example, at the highest inhibitor concentration ([I] = 444 nM, bottom curve 
149  shown in red in Fig. 2c) it takes approximately 20 minutes for the enzyme to become fully 
150  inhibited by RAY1216. In contrast, it takes less than one minute for the enzyme to become 
151  fully inhibited by PF-07321332 under identical conditions. Note in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d that 
152  the reaction rate does not decrease to zero even at inhibitor concentrations significantly 
153  higher than the enzyme concentration. This demonstrates the effective kinetic reversibility of 
154  the observed enzyme–inhibitor interactions despite the fact that the crystal structure shows a 
155  covalent binding mode (see below). Thus, RAY1216 appears to be an example of a 
156  “reversible covalent” inhibitor (Bradshaw et al., 2015). Since the equilibrium dissociation 
157  constants K = k  / k  for the two compounds are similar (Table 1), while it takes very much

158  longer for RAY1216 to fully associate with the enzyme, it necessarily means that not only the 
159  association rate constant but also the dissociation rate constant is very much lower for 
160  RAY1216, in comparison with PF-07321332. In that sense, RAY1216 could be described as 
161  a "slow-on, slow-off" inhibitor, whereas PF-07321332 inhibition of Mpro is "fast-on, fast-off". 
162  The results of a comprehensive kinetic analysis using multiple replicates (n = 3, for each 
163  inhibitor) are summarized in Table 1 (see Table S3-S4 for detailed analysis), where k  is the 
a
164  association rate constant and k  is the dissociation rate constant. The inhibition constant Ki 
d
165  and the drug-target residence time (t ) were computed from these primary regression 
res
166  parameters using the usual formulas (Copeland et al., 2006), while assuming that both 
167  inhibitors are kinetically competitive with the fluorogenic peptide substrate (see Methods for 
168  details). The results summarized in Table 1 indicate that RAY1216 has a more than an order 
169  of magnitude (12×) lower dissociation rate constant in comparison with PF-07321332. Thus, 
170  the drug-target residence time for RAY1216 is measured in hours (1.7 hr), instead of in 
171  minutes (9 min) in the case of PF-07321332. At the same time, the equilibrium binding 
172  affinity of RAY1216 (8.4 nM) measured by the inhibition constant K is only approximately 
i
173  two-fold lower than that of PF- 07321332. Note that K = (3.8 ± 0.2) nM reported here for PF-
i
174  07321332 is in good agreement with K = 3.1 (1.5−6.8) nM previously reported by Pfizer 
i
175  (Owen et al., 2021). The observed enzyme inhibition kinetics, in particular the drug-target 
176  residence time results listed in Table 1, is consistent with slow-tight inhibition of Mpro by 
177  RAY1216, suggesting that RAY1216 forms a more stable enzyme-inhibitor complex (E-I) 
178  than that formed by PF-07321332. 
179   
180  Structure of RAY1216 bound to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro 
181   
182  To further understand the activity of RAY1216, we soaked SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystals 
183  with 6 mM RAY1216 in crystallization solution and the structure of RAY1216 bound to Mpro 
184  at 2.0 Å resolution was determined by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3a and Table S5). We 
185  identified unambiguous electron density consistent with RAY1216 molecules in both active 
186  sites of Mpro dimer (Fig. 3a and Fig. S10) and the dimer appears to be largely symmetric 
187  (Fig. 3a and Fig. S11). The electron density shows that RAY1216 is covalently attached to 
188  Mpro via a thiohemiketal bond formed between the Sg sulfur of the catalytic Cys145 and the 
189  α-keto carbon of the RAY1216 warhead (Fig. 3b and Fig. S10). The α-ketoamide warhead at 
190  the inhibitor P1’ position is able to interact with the Mpro active site through a number of 
191  potential hydrogen bonds: the oxyanion (or hydroxyl) group of the thiohemiketal accepts a

192  hydrogen bond from His41; and the warhead amide oxygen is within hydrogen bond 
193  accepting distance of the backbone amides of Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 which form the 
194  canonical cysteine protease “oxyanion hole” (Fig. 3c). These interactions are consistent with 
195  the proposal that the a-ketoamide represents a superior warhead through its ability to engage 
196  two hydrogen bonding interactions to the target protease catalytic center, rather than just one 
197  (Zhang et al., 2020), as seen for aldehyde (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2011) or Michael 
198  acceptor (Tan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2020) warheads. The cyclopentyl substituent on the 
199  warhead amide is well defined by the electron density (Fig. 3b and Fig. S10) and is situated 
200  4.2 Å from the sidechain of Mpro Leu27, demonstrating a hydrophobic contact between the 
201  cyclopentyl moiety and the aliphatic Leu27 sidechain (Fig. 3c). 
202   
203  In the P2 position of RAY1216, the peptide bond is stabilized within the 
204  cyclopentylproline moiety previously utilized at the P2 position of telaprevir (Lin et al., 2006; 
205  Qiao et al., 2021). Electron density shows that the hydrophobic cyclopentyl ring slots snugly 
206  into the groove between M49 and M165 (Fig. 3b-c and Fig. S10). Plasticity has been 
207  observed for the S2 substrate binding pocket which accommodates the P2 moiety upon 
208  inhibitor binding (Fig. S11) (Kneller et al., 2020). It has been shown that S2 pockets in 
209  coronavirus Mpro have a strong preference towards hydrophobic amino acids, particularly 
210  leucine (Rut et al., 2021; Sacco et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021). It has also been shown in a 
211  separate study that dimethylcyclopropylproline and cyclopentylproline, used in boceprevir 
212  and telaprevir respectively (Fig. 1), when incorporated in a-ketoamide inhibitors, can each 
213  occupy the S2 pocket with similar potencies (Qiao et al., 2021). 
214   
215  The P3 moiety of RAY1216 features a cyclohexyl group that extends towards the 
216  exterior of the active site without making any direct contacts with Mpro (Fig. 3c). The density 
217  for the cyclohexyl para-carbon positioned furthest from the active site cavity is weak (Fig. 
218  3b), suggesting that the cyclohexyl group remains relatively flexible within the inhibitor-
219  enzyme complex. Nevertheless, it has been reported that substituents at P3 position can affect 
220  both drug potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Owen et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2021). 
221   
222  RAY1216 and PF-07321332 share the same γ-lactam and tri-fluoroacetamide moieties at 
223  P1 and P4 respectively. The P1 γ-lactam is known as an optimal fragment for viral protease 
224  inhibition as it mimics glutamine and has been proven to be responsible for potent inhibitory 
225  activity against a variety of enzymes with specificity towards native substrates with a P1 
226  glutamine (Dragovich et al., 1999; Owen et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2021). In the RAY1216:

227  Mpro complex, the γ-lactam nitrogen donates potential hydrogen bonds to the backbone 
228  carbonyl oxygen of Phe140 (3.19 Å), to the carboxylate of Glu166 (3.17 Å), and to the 
229  sidechain hydroxyl of Ser1 from the second monomer of the MPro dimer (Fig. 3c). The γ-
230  lactam carbonyl oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond (2.54 Å) from the imidazole of His163 
231  (Fig. 3c). These interactions have also been observed in the complex formed between PF-
232  07321332 and Mpro (Fig. 3d) (Owen et al., 2021). Clear electron density is observed for the 
233  P4 tri-fluoroacetamide capping moiety in the RAY1216:Mprocomplex structure (Fig. 3b and 
 
234  Fig.S10), it contacts Leu167 sidechain and accepts a hydrogen bond from Gln192 amide 
235  (Fig. 3c). Equivalent interactions have been observed in the PF-07321332:Mprocomplex 
 
236  structure (Fig. 3d) (Owen et al., 2021). In summary, despite differences in the P1’ warhead, 
237  P2 bicycloproline and P3 substituent structures, interactions mediated by the P1 γ-lactam and 
238  P4 tri-fluoroacetamide moieties are largely maintained between RAY1216 and PF-07321332. 
239   
240  Antiviral activities of RAY1216 in cell culture and mouse models 
241   
242  Based on the encouraging in vitro activity of RAY1216, we next sought to investigate 
243  inhibitory activity of RAY1216 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell and mouse model. 
244  The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC ) of RAY1216 was determined to be 511 μM for 
50
245  VeroE6 cells (Fig. S12). In virus inhibition assays the half-maximal effective concentration 
246  (EC ) values for RAY1216 against different SARS-CoV-2 variants are 95 nM (WT), 130 
50
247  nM (Alpha), 277 nM (Beta), 97 nM (Delta), 86 nM (Omicron BA.1) and 158 nM (Omicron 
248  BA.5), respectively (Fig. 4a). The corresponding selectivity indices (SI, CC /EC ) are

252  We further characterized the protective effect of RAY1216 against virus infection in a 
253  human ACE2 transgenic mouse model (Bao et al., 2020). Mice were intranasally challenged 
254  with lethal doses (105 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) and the protective effect of 
255  RAY1216 was assessed. The mortality of the mice in the untreated virus-infected group was 
256  100% at 5 days post-infection. RAY1216 administered at three different doses (600 
257  mg/kg/day, 300 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day) was able to protect mice infected with 
258  SARS-CoV-2 by 100%, 43% and 14%, respectively (Fig. 4b). This result suggests that 
259  treatment with RAY1216 effectively prolonged survival of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice (Fig. 
260  4c). To examine effect of RAY1216 on lung virus titre and pathology, a separate set of 
261  experiments was performed with a non-lethal dose of virus inoculum (103.5 PFU). RAY1216

262  (600 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) decreased viral titres in lungs significantly compared 
263  with the infection-only group (Fig. 4d). Compared to the infection-only group, RAY1216 
264  (600 mg/kg/day) was able to reduce lung virus titre by more than 1 Log unit. This effect may 
265  be slightly weaker for RAY1216 compared to PF-07321332 under the same experimental set-
266  up (Fig. 4d and e), but the difference is not statistically significant. Lung histopathology of 
267  infected mice, compared to that of infected mice treated by RAY1216, shows that RAY1216 
268  administered at 600 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day reduced virus induced pathology (Fig. 4f). 
269  RAY1216 administered at a dose of 600 mg/kg/day provided a similar level of protection 
270  against lung tissue inflammation injury to that observed with PF-07321332 (Fig. 4f). 
271   
272  Pharmacokinetics of RAY1216 
273   
274  Pharmacokinetics (PK) can significantly influence drug therapeutic efficacy. We next 
275  examined pharmacokinetics of RAY1216 and PF-07321332 in head-to-head experiments. 
276  RAY1216 and PF-07321332 show comparable in-vitro stabilities in plasmata of various 
277  different animal species (Table S6), based on this result, we investigated in-vivo PK 
278  properties of RAY1216 and compared with those of PF-07321332 in mice, rats and 
279  cynomolgus macaques (Table 3). Following intravenous (IV) administration, RAY1216 has 
280  plasma clearance (Cl) rates in the range of 10 – 22.5 mL/min/kg (compared to 23.4 – 30.2 
281  mL/min/kg for PF-07321332) and elimination half-lives in the range of 0.9 - 3.8 h (compared 
282  to 0.3 – 0.7 h for PF-07321332) among different animals. Following oral (PO) 
283  administration, RAY1216 has elimination half-lives ranging between 2.6 – 14.9 h (compared 
284  to 1.1-1.4 h for PF-07321332) among the different animal models. These characteristics 
285  represent an improvement over PF-07321332, which demonstrates faster plasma clearance 
286  and shorter elimination half-lives under equivalent conditions across all the animal models 
287  tested. These in vitro and in vivo data indicate that RAY1216 may have promising human PK 
288  profile. Indeed, it has been noted in a number of studies that α-ketoamides appear to possess 
289  superior chemical and metabolic stability, particularly comparing to aldehyde based 
290  peptidomimetics (Robello et al., 2021). 
291   
292  In mouse pharmacokinetics experiments, RAY1216 also exhibits improvements when 
293  compared to PF-07321332, in area under the curve from time 0 extrapolated to last 
294  (AUC ) for serum drug concentration (Fig. 5). Based on EC /EC  values determined 
0~last 50 90
295  using VeroE6 cells, a single IV dose of 3 mg kg–1 maintained the RAY1216 plasma 
296  concentration above EC  and EC  for 4 hours and 8 hours respectively. A single PO dose of

301  Discussion 
302   
303  In this study, we characterized inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by RAY1216, a 
304  peptidomimetic inhibitor. This compound features a cyclopentyl-substituted α-ketoamide 
305  warhead, a P1 pyroglutamine (known to confer selectivity towards CoV Mpro), a P2 
306  cyclopentylproline as originally utilized in the anti-HCV drug telaprevir (Yip et al., 2004a), a 
307  P3 cyclohexylglycine, and finally a P4 tri-fluoroacetamide as utilized in PF-07321332. We 
308  found more extensive interactions between the covalently attached drug and the SARS-CoV-
309  2 Mpro enzyme in the crystal structure of the RAY1216:Mpro acyl enzyme complex, compared 
310  with that of PF-07321332. In enzyme inhibition assays we found that RAY1216 inhibits Mpro 
311  via a slow-tight mechanism, with an approximately 12-fold longer drug-target residence time. 
312  These inhibition characteristics suggest that RAY1216 forms a more stable acyl-enzyme 
313  adduct when compared with PF-07321332. It has recently emerged that drug-target residence 
314  time is an important parameter to optimise for drug efficacy (Copeland et al., 2006; Dahl and 
315  Akerud, 2013; Lu and Tonge, 2010). In pharmacokinetic studies, RAY1216 showed 
316  improved elimination half-lives compared to PF-07321332. This may allow its use without 
317  ritonavir which is known to have significant unwanted drug-drug interactions.  
318   
319  In summary, RAY1216 possesses superior drug-target residence time and 
320  pharmacokinetic properties when compared with PF-07321332 (nirmatrelvir), the active anti-
321  viral component in Paxlovid. On the other hand, PF-07321332 is slightly favoured over 
322  RAY1216 in reducing mouse lung viral titre. The real-world efficacy of RAY1216 as a 
323  potential therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans will be revealed by phase III 
324  clinical trial, which is currently ongoing.

839  syringe needle. The MS vial was placed in a closed brown bottle which contained 0.1 - 0.2 
840  cm level of n-hexane. Solutions were let stand at 20 - 30 °C for 48 hours. After granular 
841  white crystals were observed in the MS vial, the isopropyl acetate was removed, and a single

854  Recombinant protein production 
855  Based on a previous study (Zhang et al., 2020), a construct encoding SARS-CoV-2 Mpro 
856  (ORF1ab 3264-3569, GenBank code:MN908947.3）was subcloned into the pGEX-6p-1 
857  vector between the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites with extra C-terminal extension 
858  GPHHHHHHHHHH. The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The 
859  construct plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells (Vazyme, #C504-02/03) 
860  and scale-up expression (~ 6 L) was started from a single colony in LB medium 
861  supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C. The cells were induced with 0.5 mM 
862  IPTG when the OD600 reached 0.8. Cells were allowed to grow post induction for 20 h at 
863  16 °C.  
864  The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellet was lysed in the lysis buffer 
865  (20mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150mM NaCl, 10mM imidazole) by sonication on ice. Cell lysate was 
866  cleared by high-speed centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4°C for 1h). The supernatant was mixed 
867  with Ni-NTA resin for ~ 2 h at 4 °C on a shaker. The Ni-NTA resin was washed with two 
868  buffers of different imidazole concentrations (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM/50 
869  mM imidazole) each for over 30 resin volumes to remove contaminants. The target protein 
870  was eluted by the elution buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). 
871  400U Human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C enzyme was added into the eluted protein to remove the 
872  C-terminal histidine tag and the mixture was dialysed at 4 °C overnight in dialysis buffer (20 
873  mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1m M DTT) using a dialysis bag with MWCO (Molecular 
874  Weight Cut Off) of 10 kDa. The dialysed mixture was reloaded onto the Ni-NTA resin and 
875  His-tag-free target protein was collected from the flow-through. 
876  Since the expressed Mpro contains the native Mpro cleavage sequence “SAVLQ/SGFRK” 
877  found between Nsp4 and Nsp5 (Mpro) in the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp polyprotein (slash indicates 
878  the Mpro cleavage site) near the N-terminus, Mpro auto-cleaving activity generates an authentic 
879  N-terminus during protein expression. The HRV 3C enzyme recognition site has the 
880  sequence (LEVLFQ/GP, slash indicates the HRV 3C enzyme cleavage site) after HRV 3C 
881  cleavage, it will generate an authentic Mpro C-terminus (LEVLFQ/SAV, native Mpro C-
882  terminal recognition sequence, slash indicates the cleavage site). Purified Mpro with authentic 
883  N- and C-termini was concentrated by a 10 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra 50 centrifugal filters

885  crystallization without freezing or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored under -80 °C. 
886  Enzyme activity assay 
887  The enzyme assays were performed in enzyme kinetics assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 150 
888  mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) using Dabcyl-
889  KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME-Edans (Beyotime, #P9733, ‘/’ indicates the Mpro cleavage site) as the 
890  substrate. Florescent signal by enzyme cleavage of the substrate was monitored on a 
891  Molecular Devices FlexStation 3 reader with filters for excitation at 340 nm and emission at 
892  490 nm at 20 °C. 
893  Molar response coefficient of fluorescent product 
894  Mpro at a relatively high concentration (1.0 μM) was assayed with 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 
895  80 μM substrate at 37 °C. Under these experimental conditions the substrate was completely 
896  converted into the fluorogenic product over a course of 20 minutes. The total observed 
897  change in fluorescence intensity (∆F), when plotted against the starting concentration of 
898  substrate ([S]), displayed a significant involvement of the frequently seen Dabcyl-Edans 
899  inner-filter effect (Liu et al., 1999). The dependence of ∆F on [S] follows a non-linear 
900  quadratic function as illustrated in Fig. S6a. However, within the restricted range of substrate 
901  concentrations (1.25 - 20 μM, Fig. S6b) the dependence of ∆F on [S] is approximately linear, 
902  with the slope equal to the differential molar response coefficient of the product r  = (88.1 ± 
P
903  3.5) rfu/μM. Thus, in all the following enzyme kinetic analyses we constrained the substrate 
904  concentration accordingly ([S] ≤ 20 μM) and treated the molar response coefficient as a fixed 
905  parameter, set to the best-fit value of r  = 88 rfu/μM.

909  the Michaelis-Menten equation were found to be inaccurate due to the Dabcyl-Edans inner-
910  filter effect (Liu et al., 1999). Thus, substrate kinetic parameters were determined by the 
911  global fit of reaction progress curves recorded at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μM to the first-order 
912  ordinary differential-equation (ODE) model corresponding to the reaction mechanism shown 
913  in Scheme 1, using the software package DynaFit (Kuzmic, 1996; 2009). The DynaFit script

917  The mathematical model for the reaction progress curves is auto-generated by DynaFit

963  The results listed in Table S3 show that all adjustable model parameters were obtained with 
964  better than 11% reproducibility. The enzyme was approximately 61% active. The turnover 
965  number k  = 0.12 s−1 compares well with k  = 0.16 s−1 previously reported (Ma et al., 
cat cat
966  2020). Similarly, the inhibition constant K ≡ k /k  = (3.8 ± 0.2) nM determined here 
i d a
967  compares well with the previously reported value of K = 3.1 (1.5 − 6.8) nM (Owen et al.,

969  bimolecular association rate constant equal to k  = 4.9 × 105 M−1s−1. The drug-target

971  Inhibition kinetics of RAY1216  
972  Preliminary analysis of RAY1216 inhibition data revealed that it is possible to reliably deter- 
973  mine either the turnover number k  ≡ k , or the active enzyme concentration [E], but not 
cat dP
974  both. However, the precise values of these model parameters and in particular the active 
975  enzyme concentration strongly influence the best-fit values of the inhibition rate constants k  
a
976  and k . For this reason we have analysed the RAY1216 datasets while treating the 
d
977  microscopic rate constant k  as a fixed parameter determined in the fit of the PF-07321332 
dP
978  data above (The RAY1216 and PF-07321332 experiments were carried out in parallel on the 
979  same day using the same Mpro prep). (The “??” notation is deleted on the “kdP” line in the 
980  provided DynaFit script to fix “k ” for fitting the RAY1216 datasets.)

981   
982  Thus, the complete list of globally optimized parameters (shared by all progress curves) 
983  consists of k , k , and [E]; the ten baseline offset values, F , each specific to a particular 
a d 0
984  progress curve, were again treated as locally adjustable model parameters. The overlay of 
985  experimental data on the best-fit model curves and the corresponding plots of instantaneous 
986  reaction rates are shown in Fig. S9. Note that, in comparison with Fig. S8, the instantaneous 
987  rate plots show significantly longer time that is required for near-equilibrium to be 
988  established, even at the highest inhibitor concentrations. This graphically illustrates that 
989  RAY1216 is a “slow-on, slow-off” inhibitor of Mpro, while PF-07321332 is a “fast-on, fast-
990  off” inhibitor. Numerical results of fit are summarized in Table S4. 
991  The results listed in Table S4 show that all adjustable model parameters were obtained with 
992  better than 5% reproducibility. The enzyme was apparently 66% active. This value differs 
993  slightly from the 61% enzyme activity determined in the analysis of PF-07321332 data (see 
994  Table S3). We observed that, throughout the working day, the enzymatic activity of Mpro 
995  decreased slightly but systematically over time. RAY1216 associates relatively slowly with 
996  the target enzyme, with bimolecular association rate constant equal to k  = 1.9 × 104 M−1s−1

997  The inhibition constant of RAY1216, K = 8.4 nM, is 2.2 times higher than the K for PF-

999  11.5 times longer.

1000  Crystallization and crystal soaking with RAY1216 inhibitor 
1001  Apo Mpro crystals were crystallized by mixing 1 μl of freshly purified Mpro (without freezing) 
1002  at 10 mg/ml with 1 μl crystallization solution (0.1 M MES monohydrate pH 6.5, 12% w/v 
1003  Polyethylene glycol 20,000) using hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. 
1004  Crystals normally grew overnight. The apo crystals were flash frozen in cryoprotection 
1005  solution (0.1 M MES monohydrate pH 6.5, 12% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000, 40% 
1006  glycerol) using liquid nitrogen. To obtain RAY1216 soaked crystals, apo crystals were 
1007  transferred into the crystallization solution supplemented with 6.6 mM RAY1216 and 3% 
1008  DMSO (from the RAY1216 solution). The crystals were soaked for ~10 min at 16 °C. 
1009  Finally, crystals were briefly soaked in cryoprotection solution (0.1 M MES monohydrate pH 
1010  6.5, 12% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000, 40% glycerol) supplemented with 6.6 mM 
1011  RAY1216 before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
1012  Data collection and structure determination 
1013  Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline BL19U1 at Shanghai 
1014  Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at 100 K using an Eiger X 16M hybrid-photon-
1015  counting (HPC) detector. Data integration and scaling were performed using the XDS 
1016  software (BUILT 20220220) (Kabsch, 2010). Structures were determined by molecular 
1017  replacement (MR) using the Phaser MR 2.8.3 (McCoy et al., 2007) program in CCP4 7.1.018 
1018  (Winn et al., 2011), with a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure (Zhao et al., 2022) (PDB code: 
1019  7VH8) as the search model. Iterative manual model building was carried out in Coot 0.9.6 
1020  (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), Final structures were refined with Refmac 5.8.0267 (Murshudov 
1021  et al., 1997) . The data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 
1022  S5. 
1023  Cell lines and virus strains 
1024  African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero E6) cells were purchased from the American 
1025  Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
1026  (DMEM, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA), 100

1034  Cytotoxicity and cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays-SARS-CoV-2 
1035  The 50% toxicity concentration (CC ) for RAY1216 in Vero E6 cells was determined using 
50
1036  the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthazolk-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay (Park et al., 
1037  2011). Different dilutions of RAY1216 and PF-07321332 were incubated with Vero E6 (5 × 
1038  104 cells/well) cells in 96-well plates for the cytotoxicity assay, and the concentration of 
1039  RAY1216 and PF-07321332 causing 50% cell death were determined as the CC  value. The 
50
1040  50% inhibition concentration (EC ) of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was used to 
50
1041  investigate the efficacy of RAY1216 and PF07321332 against SARS-CoV-2. A monolayer of 
1042  Vero E6 cells was inoculated with 100 TCID  of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype or variant strains at 
50
1043  37 °C for 2 h. The cells were incubated with different concentrations of RAY1216 and PF-
1044  07321332 after removal of the inoculum. Infected cells were observed under a microscope 
1045  after 72 h of incubation to assess CPE. Dose response curves were plotted as CPE vs Log 
1046  inhibitor concentrations. The selectivity indices (SI) were determined using the ratio of CC
50 
1047  to EC .

1048  Antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of RAY1216 in mouse model 
1049  Antiviral studies using animals were approved by the Guangzhou Medical University Ethics 
1050  Committee of Animal Experiments (IACUC certificate No.: GZL0008). All antiviral 
1051  experiments using animals passed the ethical review and were performed in strict accordance 
1052  with the National Research Council Criteria and the Chinese Animal Protection Act. Five-to 
1053  six-week-old female ACE2 transgenic C57BL/6 mice (Bao et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2022) 
1054  weighing 18–22 g were acquired from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China) and housed 
1055  under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at Guangzhou Customs District Technology 
1056  Center Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Laboratory. Mice were randomly divided into six groups 
1057  (n = 7): the control group; SARS-CoV-2 virus (Delta variant (B.1.617.2)) infected group; 
1058  treatment groups of three different RAY1216 concentrations (600 mg/kg/day, 300 mg/kg/day, 
1059  150 mg/kg/day); and a PF-07321332 treatment group (600 mg/kg/day). Mice were 
1060  anesthetized by inhalation of 5% isoflurane and each mouse was inoculated with 50 μl PBS 
1061  containing a lethal dose of 105 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) for the infected groups. For 
1062  the control group, 50 µl PBS was administered intranasally. 2 hr after infection, the infected 
1063  mice were intragastrically administered with RAY1216 (600 mg/kg/day, 300 mg/kg/day, 150 
1064  mg/kg/day), PF-07321332 (600 mg/kg/day) or PBS daily for 5 days. Weight change and

1067  grouping and conditions except that each mouse was inoculated with a non-lethal dose of 
1068  103.5 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) for the infected groups. At 3 and 5 days post 
1069  infection, mice were sacrificed, and lung tissues were collected to measure virus titres and to 
1070  examine lung pathology. 
1071  In-vitro plasma stability analysis 
1072  To assess in-vitro plasma stabilities of RAY1216 and PF-07321332, 2 µM of the tested 
1073  compounds  were  incubated  in  plasma  from  different  CD-1  mouse,  SD  rat,  beagle  dog, 
1074  cynomolgus monkey and human at 37 ℃ for 2 hr. 40 μL of samples were added into 160 μL 
1075  of internal standard working solution (200 ng/mL tolbutamide in MeOH). The mixed solutions 
1076  were vortex and centrifuged at 16000 g for 10 min at 2-8 °C. The supernatant was analysed by 
1077  LC-MS/MS. 
1078  Pharmacokinetic studies 
1079  The pharmacokinetic (PK) studies using animals were approved by the WuXi AppTec Ethics 
1080  Committee of Animal Experiments (IACUC certificate No.: NJ-20220531). All animals used 
1081  in this study were male and chosen randomly. Pharmacokinetic properties of RAY1216 and 
1082  PF-07321332 following a single intravenous injection (IV) or gavage (PO) administration 
1083  were examined. Briefly, two groups were assigned for each animal species, male CD-1 
1084  mouse (2 mice/group), male SD rat (3 rats/group) and male cynomolgus macaque (2 
1085  cynomolgus macaques /group), respectively. The test compound was administered to each 
1086  group at the indicated dose, orally or intravenously. The specific doses administered are 
1087  shown in Table 3. Plasma samples of animals in IV groups were collected before 
1088  administration (0), 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after administration; samples of 
1089  animals in PO groups were collected before administration (0), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 
1090  hours after administration. 
1091  LC-MS/MS analysis of plasma samples 
1092  Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation and concentrations of the compounds in the 
1093  serum were assessed by LC-MS/MS. On an ACQUITY UPLC System, ACQUITY UPLC
