StudyDesign:Cohortstudy;Levelofevidence,3.
Methods:Includedwere31active-dutymilitarypatientsaged<40yearswhounderwentsimultaneousmicrofractureofchondral
lesionsoftheglenoidandlabralrepairforshoulderinstabilitybetweenJanuary2011andJanuary2017(microfracturegroup)and
209 patients without chondral defects who underwent shoulder stabilization during the same time period (instability group).
Preoperativeand5-yearpostoperativeoutcomes(rangeofmotion[ROM],visualanalogscale[VAS]forpain,SingleAssessment
Numeric Evaluation [SANE] score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] shoulder score, and Rowe instability score)
were compared within and between groups, and separate subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether variant of
instabilityanddominant-shoulderinvolvementwereassociatedwithworseoutcomes.
Results: The mean follow-up was significantly longer for the microfracture group versus the instability group (95.58 ± 23.12 vs
83.38±25.93months;P¼.014).Ageandsexdistributionsweresimilarbetweengroups.Inbothgroups,therewassignificantpre-
