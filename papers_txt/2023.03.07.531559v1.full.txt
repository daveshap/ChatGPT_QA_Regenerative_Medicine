ABSTRACT 
 
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most frequent form of paediatric soft-tissue sarcoma and 
remains a medical challenge, holding in failure current therapeutic strategies. RMS shares 
histological features with cells of the muscle lineage and this cancer is thought to arise from 
malignant  transformation  of  myogenic  precursors.  It  has  been  proposed  that  RMS  and 
myogenesis could represent the “Jekyll and Hyde” of skeletal muscle. The underlying idea is 
that some early steps of myogenic differentiation are blocked in RMS, and that understanding 
how the normal process has gone awry could help to decipher the biological underpinnings of 
tumorigenesis and tumor escape.  
 
It is widely agreed that extracellular matrix (ECM) interferes in skeletal muscle regeneration 
and that defects in ECM components are clinically significant. The challenge is now to decipher 
actors and mechanisms responsible for the transmission of signals to muscle cells and the 
subsequent alterations that could be associated with RMS.  
 
Using an original transgenic mice model, we show here that ADAMTSL1 is involved in skeletal 
muscle regeneration. As previously reported for other members of its family, ADAMTSL1 is 
part of the TGF-b-ECM-sequestering complex and likely positively regulates TGF-b-pathway 
activity. Last, we observed that ADAMTSL1 expression behaves as a strong prognostic factor 
in the aggressive fusion-positive RMS and correlates with a neural-like phenotype of tumor 
cells, resulting from gain of SMAD2/3/4 targets.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS)  is  the  most  frequent  form  of  pediatric  soft-tissue  sarcoma, 
accounting  for  5%  of  solid  pediatric  tumors1.  Two  major  histological  subtypes  are 
distinguished: alveolar RMS (ARMS) driven by PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 translocations in 
80% of cases, and embryonal RMS (ERMS), which are genetically heterogeneous. RMS shares 
histological features with cells of the skeletal muscle lineage and high expression levels of 
myogenic proteins such as MyoD, Myogenin, and Desmin are also observed in tumors. RMS 
are thought to arise, at least in part, from malignant transformation of skeletal muscle 
precursors2. The notion that the molecular pathogenesis of myogenic cancers, and notably 
RMS,  may  share  similarities  with  muscular  dystrophies  has  begun  to  emerge3.  Indeed, 
increased  propensity  to  develop  RMS  has  been  reported  in  some  murine  models  of 
dystrophies4. This is thought to result notably from the induction of inflammation, fibrosis and 
oxidative stress that accompany both tumor development and muscular dystrophies. Some of 
the molecules described as deregulated in dystrophies have also been connected to RMS 
occurrence  and  reciprocally.  Intragenic  deletions  in  dystrophin,  mutated  in  Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy, are one of the underlying causes of tumor escape in RMS5. Proteins 
related to DUX4, whose gain of expression is now pointed to be largely responsible for Facio-
Scapulo-Humeral  Dystrophy  (FSHD),  are  also  expressed  in  human  RMS  cell  lines6,7. 
Reciprocally, significant enrichment of cancer-related genes has been observed among genes 
altered in FSHD muscle cells, thereby suggesting that pathogenesis of dystrophies and cancers 
may indeed be driven by modifications of a common set of genes and associated-signaling 
pathways. 
 
Among these signaling pathways, figures Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) one.  TGF-
β is a polypeptide that regulates several aspects of cells physiology in different tissues and has 
multiple  effects  in  pathological  conditions.  In  skeletal  muscle,  it  has  been  involved  in 
regulation of muscle growth/size, myogenesis and possibly even stemness8. This cytokine 
affects skeletal muscle function in diseases, as exemplified with fibrosis in dystrophic muscles9 
and recently with muscle cachexia observed in some cancers8,10,11. TGF-β also plays a complex 
role in tumor progression, since it is considered as a tumor suppressor in the early steps of 
tumorigenesis, and as an oncogene in advanced tumors11. It has notably been shown to inhibit

tumor cells differentiation and to promote proliferation in RMS12. TGF-β is secreted as a latent 
cytokine that is further sequestered by extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Indeed, the 
three TGF-β isoforms are synthetized as pro-proteins. After proteolytical cleavage, the pro-
domain, called LAP (Latency-Associated Peptide (LAP)), remains non-covalently associated to 
the mature TGF-β moieties, forming a complex called Small Latent Complex (SLC)13. In the 
endoplasmic  reticulum,  this  SLC  complex  covalently  interacts  with  Latent-Transforming 
Growth Factor-b binding proteins (LTBP) to form the Large Latent Complex (LLC). Since LTBP1, 
2, 3 and 4 are microfibril-associated proteins that bind to fibrillin, the LLC is incorporated to 
the ECM and TGF-β is stored in this latent form that is unable to bind to cell-surface 
receptors13. Once released from the LAP pro-domain, TGF-β binds to TβRI and TβRII receptors, 
which trigger the so-called non-canonical and canonical SMAD signaling pathway that leads to 
changes in gene expression.  
 
The regulation of TGF-β bioavailability within the ECM is therefore crucial for appropriate 
mobilization and activation of this cytokine. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying the 
mobilization of latent TGF-β from this local reservoir could shed new light on the role exerted 
by ECM on skeletal muscle homeostasis on one hand, and on alterations associated to 
tumorigenesis in RMS on the other hand. Very little is known about alterations of ECM in RMS, 
but some ECM proteins have been characterized as biomarkers14.  
 
Here, we decided to study the role of ADAMTSL1 [a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 
with thrombospondin motifs)-like 1] in these processes. ADAMTSL1 is the first identified 
member of a family of ECM-associated proteins that are closely related to ADAMs and 
ADAMTS metalloproteinases, but devoid of enzymatic activity15. The role of ADAMTSL1 in 
mammals  remains  unknown.  Interestingly,  high  expression  levels  of  ADAMTSL1  were 
detected/described in skeletal muscle15. Moreover, 3 of the 7 members of the ADAMTSL 
family,  namely  ADAMTSL2,  3  and  6,  are  part  of  the  ECM  complex  regulating  TGF-β 
bioavailability16–18. In line with these issues, we show here that ADAMTSL1 contributes to 
skeletal muscle homeostasis by modulating TGF-b bioavailability, and that the subsequent 
impairment of its function is involved in RMS phenotype, and notably behaves as a prognostic 
factor in the most aggressive fusion-positive ones.

RESULTS 
 
Loss of ADAMTSL1 induces mild spontaneous muscular phenotype during ageing but is 
involved in muscle regeneration as a FAP-secreted protein. 
Since ADAMTSL1 was described as mostly expressed in skeletal muscles15, we analysed its 
function in this tissue by characterizing an original Adamtsl1 KO mice, generated via MMRRC 
repository, through constitutive excision of exon 1 (Figure 1A). We validated the deletion of 
Adamtsl1 exon 1 in progeny using specific primers (Figure S1A). Adamtsl1+/- and Adamtsl1-/- 
mice were born at expected mendelian frequencies, healthy and fertile.  
We confirmed that the transcription of Adamtsl1 is significantly turned off in skeletal muscles 
of homozygous KO animals as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (Figure 1A). Of 
note, ADAMTSL1 KO mice are identifiable by a kink at the end of the tail (Figure S1B). Loss of 
ADAMTSL1 is not associated with obvious changes in skeletal muscle organization in young 
animals (data not shown). However, defects can be observed in KO animals from 6 months of 
age, with a 20% decrease in mean muscle fiber diameter, especially in fast contraction type 
IIb fibers (Figure 1B). This muscle fiber hypotrophy is associated with a slight atrophy of the 
Gastrocnemius+Soleus assembly at 12 months only (Figure S1C). Consistent with progressive 
muscle weakening during ageing, a typical hunchback is observable in one-year Adamtsl1-/- 
animals (Figure S1D). These changes were not associated with any difference in the number 
of Pax7+ cells nor in the percentage of centronucleated fibers, suggesting that the defects may 
likely result in part from alterations of muscle cell differentiation (Figure S1E-F). We then 
wondered what its contribution in muscle regeneration could be. To do so, we compared 
skeletal muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin (CTX) injection in adult KO mice and their wild-
type counterparts. As shown on Figure 1C, ADAMTSL1 loss is associated with defects in muscle 
regeneration characterized by lipid droplets accumulation. These defects are not due to 
intrinsic failure of Adamtsl1 KO satellite cells to differentiate and fuse, as shown by their ability 
to do so when isolated in vitro (Figure 1D). Of note, the number of Pax7+, a readout of satellite 
cell self-renewal, are similar in KO and WT animals 28 days post-CTX injection (Figure S1G). 
Since satellite cells phenotype does not seem to be intrinsically affected by ADAMTSL1 loss, 
we sought to identify whether this matrix protein was secreted by a specific skeletal muscle 
cell population. Using single-cell analysis, we observed that ADAMTSL1 is mostly expressed by

Fibro-Adipogenic Precursors (FAP, Figure 1E) and that its expression is increased during 
regeneration in this population (Figure 1F). 
 
Then, loss of FAP-produced ADAMTSL1 is associated with muscular defects during ageing and 
regeneration. 
 
ADAMTSL1 belongs to the FBN1 matrix complex regulating TGF availability. 
To clarify the role of ADAMTSL1 in muscle homeostasis, we decided to study it in the context 
of muscular dystrophy. Indeed, repeated lesions of muscle fibers in patients suffering from 
Duchenne  dystrophy  trigger  permanent  regeneration  cycles,  finally  leading  to  muscle 
fibrosis19. By integrating public transcriptomic data from the analysis of muscles’ biopsies of 
Duchenne patients at different stages of the disease, we observed that ADAMTSL1 expression 
increases sequentially at the three stages of the disease, i.e. mild, moderate and severe (Figure 
2A). The same trend is observed for ADAMTSL3 and 4, although less significantly, but not for 
ADAMTSL2 (Figure S2A). On the contrary, the expression of ADAMTSL5 decreases under the 
same conditions. Interestingly, ADAMTSL2, 3 and 6 have been described as matrix proteins, 
associated with the TGF-β-fibrillin sequestering complex16–18, and TGF-β is one of the main 
contributors to the muscle fibrosis observed in the context of muscular dystrophy20. Thus, it 
was tempting to speculate that ADAMTSL1 could play a role in muscle homeostasis by 
regulating TGF-β bioavailability. As shown on Figure 2B, ADAMTSL1 colocalizes with LTBP1 and 
FBN1 in the muscle ECM of patients with dystrophy. In addition, we used the PROGENy 
method to infer downstream apoptotic-response footprint from perturbation-response genes 
indicative of the TGF-β activity21. This score is significantly increased in moderate grade 
dystrophic muscle samples as compared to mild grade, and even more significantly between 
severe and mild grades (Figure S2B), consistent with the activation of this pathway in this 
pathological context22. As shown in Figure 2C, TGF-β pathway activity is significantly correlated 
with ADAMTSL1 expression notably in the group of patients with mild dystrophy (Figure 2C). 
These data suggest that ADAMTSL1 may play a positive role in the regulation of TGF-β 
bioavailability in muscles and are consistent with analyses performed in mice showing that 
the expression of 18% of the major target genes of the TGF pathway is significantly altered in 
muscles from KO mice as compared to wild-type mice (Figure 2D).

Altogether, these data indicate that ADAMTSL1 likely replays a role in muscle regeneration via 
regulation of TGF-β bioavailability. 
 
ADAMTSL1  expression  positively  correlates  with  prognosis  in  fusion-positive 
rhabdomyosarcoma and with expression of SMAD3/4 neural-like targets.  
RMS are thought to result at least in part from defects in the process of myogenesis, with a 
premature  arrest  of  muscle  cell  differentiation1,23,24.  Considering  the  role  of  TGF-β  in 
tumorigenesis and its impact on muscle differentiation in RMS12,25,26, we then wondered 
whether alterations in ADAMTSL1 expression might play a role in RMS. Integration of RNAseq 
data indicates that ADAMTSL1 expression is significantly lower in RMS than in skeletal muscle 
samples, in two independent cohorts (Figure 3A and Figure S3A). To go further, we analyzed 
the clinical value of ADAMTSL1 expression. Interestingly, the integration of transcriptomic 
data indicates that ADAMTSL1 expression is positively correlated with the prognosis in the so-
called fusion-positive RMS (FP-RMS), expressing the Pax3/7-FOXO1 translocation, but not in 
the fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS), which lack it (Figure 3B-C). Similarly, a high level of 
methylation of the ADAMTSL1 locus is associated with a poor prognosis in FP-RMS, but not in 
FN-RMS  (Figure  S3B-C).  To  clarify  the  molecular  identity  and  origin  of  the  prognostic 
differences observed between tumors with high and low levels of ADAMTSL1, we performed 
a differential expression (DE) analysis between these two subgroups. Of the 270 DE genes 
corresponding to the intersection of two independent cohorts (Figure S3D), we observed that 
64.7%  are  more  expressed  in  the  ADAMTSL1-high  tumors  group  as  compared  to  the 
ADAMTSL1-low group, as shown on heatmaps (Figures 3D and S3E). Functional gene set 
enrichment indicate that the ADAMTSL1-high tumors group is robustly defined by neural-
related pathways, especially some involved in regulation of cell migration/adhesion (Figure 
3E).  Accordingly,  but  counterintuitively  to  the  positive  prognostic  value  of  ADAMTSL1, 
ADAMTSL1 expression by 3T3 fibroblasts promotes migration of rhabdomyosarcoma cells of 
the RH30 fusion-positive line in Boyden chamber experiments (Figure 3F). Last, RMS tumors 
expressing high level of ADAMTSL, but not those with low levels of this gene, are significantly 
enriched  in  target  genes  of  SMAD2/3/4,  which  are  the  transcription  factors  activated 
downstream of TGF-β (Figure 3G).

Then, ADAMTSL1 behaves as a prognostic factor in FP-RMS and likely interfere with tumor cell 
properties through regulation of TGF-β pathway activity. 
 
DISCUSSION 
RMS account for 5% of all pediatric tumors. Intensive therapeutic management has improved 
their 5-year survival from 25% in 1970 to 60-70% since 20002. However, outcome has reached 
a plateau since that time, despite many randomized chemotherapy trials. Moreover, 2/3 of 
cured children suffer from long-term side effects of both disease and treatments2,27. This 
underscores the need to elucidate molecular mechanisms of these malignancies to develop 
new  therapeutic  strategies,  both  beneficial  for  patients  in  therapeutic  failure  and  with 
reduced toxicity. 
 
It has been proposed that RMS and myogenesis could represent the “Jekyll and Hyde” of 
skeletal muscle1. The underlying idea is that some early steps of myogenic differentiation are 
blocked in RMS: understanding how the normal process has gone awry could help to decipher 
the biological underpinnings of tumorigenesis and of tumor escape. 
Here, we show that ADAMTSL1, whose function was yet undefined, likely plays a role in muscle 
regeneration as a matrix protein, through regulation of the TGF-β pathway, and that alteration 
of its expression has a direct impact on FP-RMS aggressiveness. 
 
The role of ECM in skeletal muscle regeneration is not well understood, but it is widely agreed 
that alterations in ECM components are clinically significant. Along this line, two other 
members of the ADAMTSL family, namely ADAMTSL2 and 6, have been linked to genetic 
diseases of the Marfanoid spectrum, with mutations identified respectively in geleophysic 
dysplasia and thoracic aortic aneurysm16,28. Although not related to skeletal muscular defects, 
both proteins were also shown to be part of the FBN1 complex regulating the bioavailability 
of  TGF-β17.  Moreover,  ADAMTSL2  was  directly  identified  as  a  negative  regulator  of 
myofibroblast differentiation through inhibition of TGF-β29. Similarly, KO of ADAMTSL3 is 
associated with severe cardiac defects in mice, which result from an increase in TGF-β 
signalling, subsequently impairing myofibroblasts differentiation upon heart failure18. While 
these data suggest a conserved role of the 6 members of the ADAMTSL family in the regulation 
of TGF-β release, our results indicate that ADAMTSL1 may play the opposite role, by acting as

a positive regulator of the TGF-β signalling pathway: ADAMTSL1 could thus promote TGF-β 
release rather than its sequestration in the matrix. Consistently, fatty deposits similar to those 
observed  in  ADAMTSL1  KO  mice  after  injury  were  observed  in  transgenic  mice  that 
overexpress the human TGF-β-sequestering LTBP4 protein30, suggesting that ADAMTSL1 and 
LTBP4 may have antagonistic function on TGF-β pathway. Moreover, ADAMTSL1 expression 
correlates with TGF-β activation level in patients with Duchenne dystrophy, and its expression 
increases with disease severity: it remains however to be determined whether gain of 
ADAMTSL1 is causally involved in muscle degeneration observed in this pathology, or if it is a 
consequence of muscle fibrosis. 
 
Presence of a regenerative microenvironment in skeletal muscle, coupled with oncogenic 
alterations in cells, was shown to be sufficient to favor FN-RMS tumorigenesis in mice31. FBN2 
was also shown to have a prognostic value in FN-RMS, although through a yet undefined 
mechanism, but further highlighting the clinical relevance of ECM defects in RMS14. In contrast 
to the gain of ADAMTSL1 observed in dystrophic muscle samples, we show that the loss of 
ADAMTSL1 is highly significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness but solely in FP-RMS, 
which are the most resistant to treatments2. Of note, this prognostic value is not only visible 
at the transcriptomic level, but also at the DNA methylation one, suggesting that the alteration 
of ADAMTSL1 expression in tumors may result from epigenetic modifications. Bioinformatic 
analyses  indicate  that  ADAMTSL1  expression  is  positively  correlated  with  a  neural-like 
phenotype,  which  has  been  previously  described  by  others  in  FP-RMS24.  It  had  been 
established  that  the  neuronal  guidance  activity  of  MADD-4,  the  C.  elegans  ortholog  of 
ADAMTSL1, was dependent on the presence of the netrin-1 receptor, DCC32. Interestingly, DCC 
is one of the neuronal genes significantly enriched in the ADAMTSL1-high tumor group, 
suggesting that some mechanisms of action may be conserved across species. The oncogenic 
valence of the FP-RMS neural state has not been described so far, but we have shown here 
that it could be associated with a higher migratory ability. Further analyses are however 
needed to understand how this observation may be compatible with the better prognosis of 
FP-RMS with the highest ADAMTSL1 expression. Along this line, it was previously shown that 
ADAMTSL1 may play an oncogenic role in chondrosarcoma through positive regulation of 
proliferation33, suggesting a pleiotropic role of this protein on tumor cell phenotype, which is

probably an indirect consequence of the complex role of TGF-β in tumor initiation and 
escape11. 
 
If the precise role of ADAMTSL1 in muscular dystrophies and RMS remains to be fully 
established, our work makes it a protein worth studying to understand how deregulations of 
the  skeletal  muscle  matrix  composition  can  create  a  deleterious  microenvironment, 
particularly conducive to tumor escape.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
Design of an ADAMTSL1 knock-out model 
The B6;129S5-Adamtsl1tm1Lex/Mmucd mouse strain presenting a constitutive deletion of the 
first exon of ADAMTSL1 was obtained from MMRRC. In brief, targeting vector was constructed 
using a fragment of ADAMTSL1 gene around exon 1 (NCBI accession: AK045085). Embryonic 
stem cell electroporation, selection, and culture, as well as generation of chimaeric mice and 
Southern blot analysis were performed in the MMRRC according to classical procedures 
(https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=32134). Heterozygous mice were then 
backcrossed at least 10 times in a C57BL/6 background. Double heterozygous ADAMTSL1+/- 
mice of the offspring were interbred to generate mice homozygous for the ADAMTSL1 exon 1 
deletion. Routine genotype analysis of mice was performed by PCR assay on DNA purified from 
tail biopsies (Extract N-Amp Tissue PCR kit, Sigma Aldrich). Wild-type and KO mutant alleles 
were distinguished using primers available on request. CT-Scan was performed on the animal 
imaging platform of CRCL. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant 
guidelines and regulations of the animal ethics committee (Authorization no. CLB-2015-024; 
accreditation of laboratory animal care by CECCAPP, ENS Lyon-PBES). 
 
Quantitative RT–PCR 
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) and 1 µg was 
reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time quantitative RT–
PCR was performed on a LightCycler 2.0 apparatus (Roche) using the Light Cycler FastStart 
DNA Master SYBERGreen I kit (Roche). Oligonucleotide sequences are available on request. 
Profiling of TGF-β targets was performed using the RT² Profiler™ PCR Array Pig TGF-β Signaling 
Targets kit from Qiagen following manufacturers’ instructions. 
Skeletal muscle injury 
Prior  injection  of  CTX  (12 mM  in  saline,  Latoxan#L8102),  mice  were  anesthetized  by 
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine at 0.1 mg/g body weight and xylazine at 0.01 mg/g body 
weight diluted in saline solution. 50 μl of CTX was then injected into Tibialis Anterior muscles 
to induce injury, and mice were euthanized 0, or 28 days after the injury.

Satellite cell cultures – in vitro model of adult myogenesis 
Skeletal muscle myoblasts derived from WT and KO ADAMTSL1 mice were isolated using the 
Satellite Cell Isolation Kit MACS protocol (Miltenyi Biotec), as described previously34. 
MACS isolated Satellite cells were seeded onto Gelatin (Sigma #G1393) coated supports at 
3000 cells/cm2 and amplified ≤3 passages in proliferation medium. After amplification, MuSC 
progeny (i.e., myoblasts) were trypsinized and plated at indicated densities onto Matrigel 
coated supports. To induce differentiation, proliferation medium was removed and replaced 
by differentiation medium (DMEM F12, 2% Horse serum (HS) (Gibco #16050130), and 1 % PS).  
 
Histological and immunohistochemistry analyses on muscle cryosections and cell cultures 
For  immunohistochemical  analyses,  muscles  of  interest  were  isolated,  embedded  in 
tragacanth gum (VWR #ICNA0210479280), frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane, and 
stored at -80°C until use. 10 µm-thick cryosections were prepared for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) 
staining and immunolabeling. HE staining was used to assess the efficiency of CTX injections, 
and muscles were only kept for further analyses if ≥75% of the muscle area consisted of 
centrally nucleated fibers. 
For lipid coloration, sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 4°C during 30 min, and then 
stained with Sudan Black (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 60 minutes. Light 
microscopy was performed using an upright microscope (Leica and Olympus), and pictures 
were captured using a monochrome camera (DS-Ri1, Nikon).  
For immunohistochemistry, muscle cryosections were stained with ADAMTSL1 (Invitrogen 
MA1-41249), LTBP1 (Abcam ab78294), FBN1 (Abcam ab53076), Laminin (Abcam ab11575) and 
MHCIIA (DSHB SC-71) antibodies as described previously36. They were mounted in Vectashield 
DAPI (Vectorlabs) and observed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). Images were captured 
using the MetaView software (Ropper Scientific). For identification of satellite cells, sections 
were  fixed  for  20  min  in  4%  paraformaldehyde  (PFA)  at  Room  Temperature  (RT),  and

#FP-483331). 
 
For fusion assay, cultured cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% PFA at RT, permeabilized for 10 
min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and saturated in 4% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). 
Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies directed Desmin (Abcam 
#Ab32362; 1:200) in 2% BSA. Secondary antibodies were coupled to FITC, Cy3 or Cy5 (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Inc.; 1:200) and incubated for 45-60 min at 37°C. Nuclear counterstain was 
performed by 10 sec incubation with Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich #14533; 2 µM), and cells were 
covered with Fluoromount G (Interchim, #FP-483331).  
Randomly chosen fields of view from sections or cells cultured on removable chamber slides 
were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 connected to a Coolsnap Myo camera. For each 
condition of each experiment, at least 5-10 randomly chosen fields of view were counted. The 
fusion index was calculated as the percentage of nuclei within a cell containing ≥2 nuclei.  
 
RT-qPCR analysis in various cell populations FACS-sorted from Tibialis Anterior muscle 
Muscle cell populations were FACS-sorted as previously described37. Briefly, TA muscles were 
dissociated and digested in DMEM/F12 medium (GIBCO) containing 10 mg/ml of collagenase 
B and 2.4 U/ml Dispase II (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min at 37°C under agitation and passed 
through a 30 µm cell strainer (Myltenyi Biotec). CD45pos and CD45neg cells were separated after 
incubation with mouse CD45 MicroBeads (Myltenyi Biotec) using a MS column (Myltenyi 
Biotec) on a MiniMACS Separator (Myltenyi Biotec). CD45pos cells were incubated with mouse 
FcR Blocking Reagent (Myltenyi Biotec) for 20 min at 4°C in PBS 2% FBS and stained with PE-
Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45 (25-0451-82, eBioscience), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD64 
(139322, Biolegend) and PE-conjugated anti-Ly6C (12-5932-82, eBioscience) antibodies for 30 
min  at  4°C.  CD45neg  cells  were  stained  with  PE-Cy7-conjugated  anti-CD45,  PerCP-Cy5.5-
conjugated anti-Sca-1 (45-5981-82, eBioscience), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-a7-integrin 
(AB0000538, AB lab, University British Columbia), PE-conjugated anti-CD31 (12-0311-82, 
eBioscience) and FITC-conjugated anti-CD34 (11-0341-82, eBioscience) antibodies for 30 min 
at 4°C. After addition of DAPI (BD Biosciences) to exclude dead cells, live cells were sorted 
using a FACS Aria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

is the housekeeping gene Cyclophilin A. Sequence of primers used were as follows: 5’- 
TGGCTCAGAATGAAGCAGGG-3’ (Adamtsl1 fwd), 5’- AGTAAACACCTGAGTCGCGG-3’ (Adamtsl1 
rev),  5’-  GTGACTTTACACGCCATAATG  -3’  (Cyclophilin  A  fwd)  and  5’- 
ACAAGATGCCAGGACCTGTAT -3’ (Cyclophilin A rev). 
 
Cell culture and Migration Assays 
3T3 and RH30 were cultured according to manufacturers’ instructions. 3T3 stably expressing 
the short isoform of ADAMTSL1 tagged with GFP (available on request) were established using 
JetPrime and selected on the basis of their resistance to puromycin. 
Transwell migration assay was used to evaluate the migration capacity of the cells. 3× 104   3T3 
fibroblasts, stably overexpressing, or not, ADAMTSL1, were seeded in 24 well plate. After 3 
days,  Boyden  chambers  (8 µm  pore  size,  Corning  #353097)  were  added  in  3T3  wells. 
5 × 104 FP-RMS RH30 were seeded in the insert chamber. After 24 hours, RH30 cells were 
washed with PBS1x, then methanol-fixed for 15 min and stained with crystal violet (0.1%) for 
20 min. The quantification of cell migration was determined using ImageJ software. 
 
Public scRNA-seq data of muscle tissue 
UMAP of cell types and ADAMTSL1 expression were made using harmony integrated data 
collected by the Single-Cell Muscle Project (scMuscle)38, which is available for download at

transformed.  Raw  CEL  files  of  ETABM-1202  dataset39  (cohort  4)  were  downloaded  on 
ArrayExpress  (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-TABM-1202),  and 
were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) algorithm (oligo R library v 
1.58.0)40. The GSE167059 methylation dataset (cohort 5) used for survival analysis was 
downloaded on R2 Cancer (https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi).  
 
Generation and processing of RNA-seq datasets 
St Jude RMS 
HTseq count files of St Jude’s RMS tumors (cohort 6) were downloaded on the St Jude Cloud 
platform (https://www.stjude.cloud) and generated as described41. 
 
Inhouse RMS cohort (cohort 2) 
Tissue banking and research were conducted according to national ethics guidelines, after 
obtaining the written informed consent of patients. For RNA-seq library construction of cohort 
3, total RNAs from tissues were isolated using the AllPrep® DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 
80224) following manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were prepared with Illumina Stranded 
mRNA Prep (Illumina, cat. no. 20040534) following recommendations. Quality was further 
assessed using the TapeStation 4200 automated electrophoresis system (Agilent) with High 
Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent). All libraries were sequenced (2×100 bp) using Agilent 
SureSelect RNA XTHS2 All Exon V8 (Agilent, cat. no. G9991A) according to the standard Agilent 
protocol. 
Quality control of reads was performed using FastQC (v.0.11.9)42, followed by trimming of 
Illumina adapter sequences with Cutadapt (v.3.4)43 using the -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT and 
-A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT parameters. Reads were mapped to the GRCh38 human genome 
using “two-pass” mode STAR (v.2.7.9)44, with Ensembl v104 annotations. Gene counts were 
then computed using HTseq-count (v.0.13.5)45 with the following parameters: “--order pos” 
and “--stranded reverse”. 
 
Data normalization of both datasets 
HTseq count files were then loaded in R (v 4.2.0) and two filtration steps were applied using 
the annotations of org.Hs.eg.db (v 3.15.0)46: genes with low counts (less than 10 reads across 
samples) were removed; non-protein-coding genes were removed. Filtered gene counts were

converted into a DESeq247 object with the design parameter set to account for the sample 
type (RMS/embryonal muscle/fetal muscle) in the case of the Inhouse cohort, and for the 
fusion status (FNRMS/FPRMS) in the cohort 6. Counts were then normalized with vst using 
“blind = FALSE”. 
To  remove  unwanted  variability  driven  by  technical  factors  in  the  cohort  6,  the 
removeBatchEffect function (limma R library v 3.50.3)48 was used with the original dataset 
specified as the variable to consider in the linear model. 
The package ggplot2 (v 3.3.5)49 was used for graphical representation. 
 
Comparison of ADAMTSL1-High and ADAMTSL1-Low samples 
Definition of ADAMTSL1 expression groups 
In both cohorts 4 and 6, patients were stratified according to ADAMTSL1 expression level: 
samples with ADAMTSL1 levels > 3rd quartile (Q3) formed the high expression group, while 
samples with ADAMTSL1 levels < 1st quartile (Q1) formed the low expression group. For cohort 
5,  the  KaplanScan  method  implemented  by  R2  was  used  to  identify  the  cutoff  of  the 
ADAMTSL1 probe cg14523394, separately for each histology (eRMS/aRMS). 
 
Survival analysis 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was run on cohorts 4 and 5 (ETABM-1202 and GSE167059) for 
which clinical data were available, using the R packages survminer (v 0.4.9)50 and survival (v 
3.3-1)51. Log-rank test was used to assess significance between the survival probability of 
ADAMTSL1 High samples and ADAMTSL1 Low samples, in FNRMS and FPRMS separately, for 
all survival analysis. 
 
TGF-β pathway activity 
The R package PROGENy (v 1.18.0)21 was used to assess the activity of the TGF-β pathway 
using default parameters. Boxplots were made with ggplot2 (v 3.3.5)49. 
 
Differential expression analysis and enrichment 
Differential expression analysis on cohort 4 was run with the R package limma (v 3.50.3) based 
on previously defined ADAMTSL1 expression groups, separately for FNRMS/FPRMS. Genes a 
with a raw p-value cutoff of 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed (DE), yielding

1095 DE genes. For RMS cohort 6, DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes 
between ADAMTSL1-high and ADAMTSL1-low samples, separately in FNRMS and FPRMS. The 
alpha parameter of the “results” function was set to 0.05, and DE genes were identified with 
an adjusted p-value (FDR) cutoff of 0.05. 
The EnrichR package (v 3.0)52 was used separately on DE genes upregulated in ADAMTSL1-
high  samples  and  DE  genes  upregulated  in  ADAMTSL1-low  samples,  with  the  following 
databases: Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process 2021, GO Molecular Function 2021, GO 
Cellular Compartment 2021, KEGG 2021 Human, MSigDB Hallmarks 2020, Reactome 2016 and 
ChEA 2016. 
 
Correlation analysis 
Correlations between ADAMTSL1 and all other genes in each fusion subtype (FPRMS/FNRMS) 
were assessed using Pearson’s coefficient. Genes were considered significantly correlated 
when unadjusted p-value < 0.05. Venn diagram representation of the significantly correlated 
genes identified was made with ggvenn (v 0.1.9)53. 
 
Statistical analyses 
For in vitro experiments, replicates signify independent experiments. For in vivo experiments, 
replicates signify individual muscles. All results were analysed using unpaired parametric 
analyses. Statistical significance was determined using two-sided Student’t t tests, or Welch t 
test in case of unequal variance.  
 
Data availability 
GSE109178  (cohort  1)  and  GSE28511  (cohort  3)  datasets  were  downloaded  on  GEO 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Cohort  5  data  was  downloaded  on  R2  Cancer 
(https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi). Raw CEL files of cohort 4 (accession code 
ETABM-1202)  were  downloaded  on  ArrayExpress 
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress). St Jude dataset (cohort 6) was downloaded 
on the St Jude Cloud platform (https://www.stjude.cloud). Newly generated RNA-seq data of 
the Inhouse cohort will be made available on GEO (cohort 2).
