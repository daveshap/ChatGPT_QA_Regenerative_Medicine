26  Abstract 
27  Mutations in the well-known Myostatin (MSTN) produce a “double-muscle” 
28  phenotype, which makes it commercially invaluable for improving livestock meat 
29  production and providing high-quality protein for humans. However, mutations at 
30  different loci of the MSTN often produce a variety of different phenotypes. In the 
31  current study, we increased the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from the 
32  traditional 1:2 to 1:10, which improves the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of 
33  biallelic gene. Here, a MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep, in which the 
34  MSTN and FGF5 dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations were produced via the 
35  deletion  of  3-base  pairs  of  AGC  in  the  third  exon  of  MSTN,  resulting  in 
36  cysteine-depleted at amino acid position 273, and the FGF5 double allele mutation 
37  led to inactivation of FGF5 gene. The MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout 
38  sheep  highlights  a  dominant  “double-muscle”  phenotype,  which  can  be  stably 
39  inherited.  Both  F0  and  F1  generation  mutants  highlight  the  excellent  trait  of 
40  high-yield meat with a smaller cross-sectional area and higher number of muscle 
41  fibers per unit area. Mechanistically, the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout 
42  mediated the activation of FOSL1 via the MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis. The activated 
43  FOSL1 promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and inhibits myogenic 
44  differentiation by inhibiting the transcription of MyoD1, and resulting in smaller 
45  myotubes.

49  1 Introduction 
50  Myostatin  (MSTN)  has  been  well-known  as  a  negative  regulator  of  muscle 
51  growth and development. Its mutation produces a “double-muscle” phenotype, which 
52  shows its inestimable commercial value in improving meat production of livestock 
53  and poultry, and providing high-quality protein for humans (Fan et al., 2022; Chen et 
54  al., 2021b). Due to its role in promoting muscle atrophy and cachexia, MSTN has been 
55  recognized as a promising therapeutic target to offset the loss of muscle mass (Lee, 
56  2021; Baig et al., 2022; Wijaya et al., 2022).  
57  MSTN is highly conserved in mammals, and mutations in the MSTN gene, either 
58  artificially or naturally, will result in increased skeletal muscle weight and produce a 
59  “double-muscle” phenotype, which has been reported in many species, including 
60  cattle, sheep, and pigs, rabbits, and humans (Grisolia et al., 2009; Dilger et al., 2010; 
61  Kambadur et al., 1997). However, mutations at different loci of the MSTN often 
62  produce variety of different phenotypes, and its molecular mechanism of skeletal 
63  muscle growth and development remains controversial (Hanset and Michaux, 1985; 
64  Grobet et al., 1997; Wegner et al., 2000; Kambadur et al., 1997; Marchitelli et al., 
65  2003). More than 77 natural mutation sites of MSTN have been reported in various 
66  sheep breeds, most of these mutations were found to be located in the non-coding 
67  regions, and did not affect MSTN activity (Kijas et al., 2007; Sjakste et al., 2011; Han 
68  et al., 2013; Dehnavi et al., 2012). In addition to introns, it is still possible that 
69  mutations  in  regulatory  regions  and  exons  may  not  affect  the  sheep  phenotypes 
70  (Pothuraju et al., 2015; Kijas et al., 2007; Boman and Vage, 2009; Boman et al., 
71  2009). 
72  Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) belongs to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
73  family and is a secretory signaling protein. FGF5 played an inhibitory effect on 
74  mouse hair growth (Hebert et al., 1994), and its natural mutation can lead to a 
75  significant increase in hair growth in angora mice (Sundberg et al., 1997). Subsequent 
76  studies have also successively confirmed the inhibitory effect of FGF5 on mammalian 
77  hair growth and is recognized to be a negative regulator of hair growth (Kehler et al., 
78  2007; Dierks et al., 2013; Yoshizawa et al., 2015; Legrand et al., 2014; Higgins et al., 
79  2014).

80  FOS-like 1 (FOSL1), also named Fos-related antigen 1 (FRA1), is a member of 
81  the Fos subfamily of activator protein 1 (AP-1) superfamily. The Fos family proteins 
82  are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. FOSL1 and even 
83  AP-1 family members are generally recognized to be related to various cancers. 
84  However, accumulating evidence indicate that AP-1 family proteins play a critical 
85  role in skeletal muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and muscle development 
86  (Puntschart et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2010). FOSL1 has also been characterized as an 
87  important component of the response of skeletal muscle during aging and a lipid 
88  biosynthesis-related factor (Mathes et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2017). Furthermore, 
89  FOSL2 and c-Jun, another member of the AP-1 family, were found to inhibit myoblast 
90  differentiation (Alli et al., 2013; Bengal et al., 1992). In all, it is foreseeable that the 
91  role of FOSL1 in myogenesis will increasingly emerge. 
92  In this study, to increase both meat and wool production, we first produced the 
93  MSTN and FGF5 dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations sheep by the increased 
94  delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA targeting MSTN and FGF5. The MSTNDel273C 
95  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  sheep  highlights  a  dominant  “double-muscle” 
96  phenotype by decreasing the muscle fiber cross-sectional area and increasing the 
97  number of muscle fibers per unit area. Then, we used the MSTN and FGF5 dual-gene 
98  biallelic homozygous mutations sheep to unravel the molecular mechanism of the 
99  “double-muscle” phenotype and myofiber hyperplasia. 
100  2 Materials and Methods 
101  2.1 Tissue sample collection and preparation 
102  Gluteus medius and longissimus dorsi were harvested from WT and MSTNDel273C 
103  mutation with FGF5 knockout (MF-/-) sheep, and three WT sheep and four MF-/- F1 
104  generation sheep (half-sib) were used for feeding and slaughter. All samples were 
105  immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until analysis. All 
106  sheep are raised by the national feeding standard NT/T815-2004. All procedures 
107  performed for this study were consistent with the National Research Council Guide 
108  for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental animal protocols in this 
109  study were approved and performed following the requirements of the Animal Care

110  and  Use  Committee  at  China  Agricultural  University  (AW02012202-1-3).  All 
111  surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were 
112  made to minimize any suffering experienced by the animals used in this study.  
113  2.2 Cell isolation, culture, and transfection 
114  Sheep skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated and cultured as previously 
115  described (Chen et al., 2021a). In brief, the muscle tissues of the hind limbs from 
116  3-month-old sheep fetuses were cut into small pieces, digested with 0.2% collagenase 
117  type II (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at 37℃ for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 
118  for 10 min. The precipitates were continued digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gbico, 
119  Grand Island, NY) at 37℃ for 30 min, and digestion was terminated with serum 
120  containing medium. The cell suspension was successively filtered through 100, 200 
121  and 400 mesh cell sieves. After this, the cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min, 
122  resuspended in growth medium (GM) containing DMEM/F12 (Gbico, Grand Island, 
123  NY) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin 
124  liquid  (Gbico,  Grand  Island,  NY),  and  cultured  for  2-3  times  with  differential 
125  adhesion. To induce differentiation, the cells were cultured to 70% confluence in GM, 
126  and followed by an exchange to differentiation medium (DM) containing DMEM 
127  high glucose (Gbico, Grand Island, NY) with 2% horse serum (HS, Gibco) and 1% 
128  penicillin-streptomycin liquid to culture 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. To produce viral 
129  solution for over-expression of the target gene, it was subcloned into the XbaI and 
130  BamHI sites of the lentiviral vector by seamless cloning. HEK 293T cells were 
131  co-transfected with the envelope plasmid pMD2.G, the packaging plasmid psPAX2 
132  and  the target  plasmid  at a  mass  ratio of 1:2:4.  Then,  the  culture  medium  was 
133  collected at 48h and 72h after transfection, and the cell debris was removed by 
134  filtration. Then, the sheep skeletal muscle satellite cells were infected with packaged 
135  lentivirus when they were cultured to 60%-70% confluence in 96-well, 24-well or 
136  6-well plates. Finally, cells were collected for analysis after infection at 24 h or 48 h. 
137  All the primer sequences of gene cloning were listed in Table S1.

138  2.3 Total RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR (RT- qPCR) 
139  The total RNA of tissues and cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Sangon 
140  Biotech,  Shanghai,  China)  following  the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  In  short,  after 
141  tissues  or  cells  were  lysed,  chloroform  was  added  to  separate  the  organic  and 
142  inorganic phases, followed by precipitation with isopropanol and ethanol in turn, and 
143  finally, the RNA was dissolved in DEPC water. Then, the first strand cDNA was 
144  prepared using PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Beijing, China). 
145  qPCR  was  performed  using  2×  SYBR  Green  qPCR  Mix  (Low  ROX)  (Aidlab 
146  Biotechnologies, Beijing, Chian) in a Stratagene Mx3000P (Agilent Technologies, 
147  SUA). With GAPDH mRNA as endogenous control, the relative expression level of 
148  genes was calculated by the 2-ΔΔCt method. All primers used were listed in Table S2. 
149  2.4 Western blot 
150  Tissue or cell samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) 
151  supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime, Beijing, 
152  China) for total protein extraction. Then, equal amounts of tissue or cell lysate were 
153  resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF  membranes (Millipore, 
154  USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 1h, incubated with primary 
155  antibody at 4℃ overnight, then incubated with secondary antibody for 1h before 
156  detection. The fold change of protein was normalized to GAPDH for quantitative 
157  analysis by ImageJ software. The antibodies information was listed in Table S3.  
158  2.5 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay 
159  At 24 h after transfection, sheep skeletal muscle satellite cells were incubated at 
160  37℃ for 2 h in 96-well plates with 50 µM EdU (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China). Then, 
161  fixed the cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and neutralized using 2 mg/mL 
162  glycine solution. The Apollo® staining solution which contains EdU was added and 
163  incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark to label the DNA in the 
164  synthesis stage, the nuclear was then counterstained with DAPI. The number of EdU 
165  positive cells was counted from the images of five random fields obtained with an 
6 

NEW PAGE

166  inverted fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 100×. EdU labeling index was 
167  expressed as the number of EdU-positive cell nuclei/total cell nuclei. 
168  2.6 Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell cycle detection 
169  Skeletal muscle satellite cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 
170  appropriate time according to different experimental treatments. Then, 10 μL CCK-8 
171  solution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO  incubator for 2 h, 
2
172  and then the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. 
173  The  cultured  skeletal  muscle  satellite  cells  were  digested  with  trypsin, 
174  centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min to collect the cell pellet, washed once with ice-cold 
175  PBS, and then 1 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol was added to fix the cells overnight at 
176  4°C. The next day, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS again, and the cells were 
177  incubated with 0.5 mL PI staining solution at 37°C for 30 min and collected by flow 
178  cytometry at low speed. 
179  2.7 Immunofluorescence staining 
180  Sheep skeletal muscle cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, 
181  permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocked with 5% normal goat 
182  serum for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibody at 4℃ 
183  overnight. Next, the fluorescent secondary antibody was added and incubated at 37℃ 
184  for  1  h  in  the  dark,  and  the  nuclear  was  then  counterstained  with  DAPI.  The 
185  immunofluorescence images from five random fields were captured with an inverted 
186  fluorescence microscope. 
187  2.8 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
188  The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, then 
189  neutralized with 1× glycine solution for 5 min, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. 
190  Then, the cells were collected with a cell scraper and resuspended in 0.5 mL cell lysis 
191  buffer  (10  mM  HEPES,  0.5%  NP-40,  1.5  mM  MgCl2,  10  mM  KCl,  pH  7.9) 
192  containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime, Beijing, China) and incubated on ice 
193  for 15 min to release the cytoplasm. Next, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation 
7 

NEW PAGE

194  at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspended in 0.5 mL nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 
195  10 mM EDTA, 0.3% SDS, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitor cocktail. After the 
196  DNA was  fragmented  by  ultrasonication,  the  suspension  was  centrifuged  at  4°C 
197  12000g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. And 50 μL supernatant of each 
198  sample was diluted with 450 μL of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X- 
199  100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 167 mM NaCl), then 5 μg primary 
200  antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. The next day, 20 μL 
201  protein A/G magnetic beads were added to each sample and incubated at 4°C with 
202  rotation  for  2h.  Then,  the  magnetic  beads  were  respectively  washed  once  with 
203  low-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl 
204  pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl), high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM 
205  EDTA, 500mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% 
206  NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0), and TE 
207  buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C, and the supernatant was 
208  discarded. Next, 100 μL ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaHCO ) containing 
3
209  proteinase K was added to each sample, then incubated at 62°C overnight, and the 
210  DNA was finally purified by a purification column. 
211  2.9 RNA-seq 
212  The rRNA was removed from each total RNA sample of the gluteus medius to 
213  construct  a  strand-specific  transcriptome  sequencing  library,  and  the  Illumina 
214  Novaseq 6000 sequencing platform was used to perform high-throughput sequencing 
215  with a paired-end read length of 150 bp. Raw data were transformed into clean reads 
216  by removing reads containing adapter, ploy-N and low-quality reads from raw data. 
217  At the same time, Q20, Q30, GC-content, and sequence duplication levels of the clean 
218  data were calculated. The genome index was constructed using Hisat2 software and 
219  the clean reads were mapped to the sheep reference genome (Oar Rambouillet v1.0), 
220  the  featureCounts  software  was  used  for  expression  quantification,  and  DESeq2 
221  software was used for differential expression analysis based on P-value < 0.05 and | 
222  log2 Fold Change | > 1.

224  All results are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses of differences 
225  between groups were performed using a two-tailed Student's t-test or chi-square test 
226  and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and 
227  ***P<0.001. 
228  3 Results 
229  3.1  Elevated  molar  ratio  of  Cas9/sgRNA  can  efficiently  generate  biallelic 
230  homozygous mutant sheep 
231  The sgRNAs for targeting were designed in the third exon of the MSTN and 
232  FGF5  genes,  respectively,  to  generate  mutant  MSTN  gene  for  quality  trait 
233  improvement  and  mutant  FGF5  gene  for  yield  trait  improvement  sheep  by 
234  CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology (Figure 1A, B). Both MSTN and FGF5 PCR 
235  products could be cleaved by T7E1 and the fragment sizes were also as expected, and 
236  grayscale  analysis  showed  that  the  editing  efficiency  was  14.6%  and  11.4%, 
237  respectively (Figure 1C), which indicates that the designed sgRNAs can achieve more 
238  efficient gene targeting. 
239  The microinjection was performed according to the injection molar ratio of Cas9 
240  mRNA:sgRNAs (1:2, 1:10, and 1:15), respectively. The number of embryos injected, 
241  recipients of nuclear transfer, pregnancy, and alive lambs per group were listed in 
242  Table S4. The subsequent gene mutation detection showed that a total of 3 lambs were 
243  mutated in the MSTN and FGF5 genes at a Cas9 mRNA:sgRNAs injection molar 
244  ratio of 1:2, with a gene editing mutation rate of 14.3% (4/28). However, all 3 lambs 
245  were chimeric, that is, there were both mutant and wild-type after editing, and the 
246  biallelic mutation rate was 0% (Table S4，Figure 1D). When the injection molar ratio 
247  of Cas9 mRNA:sgRNAs was 1:10, two lambs were mutated in MSTN and FGF5 
248  genes, and the mutation rate of gene editing was 18.2 % (4/22). And these two lambs 
249  were all double-gene biallelic homozygous mutant lambs, that is, the alleles on the 
250  homologous chromosomes were mutated after the target gene was edited (Table S4, 
251  Figure  1D).  While  the  injection  molar  ratio  of  Cas9  mRNA:  sgRNAs  was 
252  continuously increased to 1:15, one lamb had a mutation, which was a biallelic 
253  mutation of MSTN gene, and the gene editing mutation rate was 7.14% (1/14) (Table 
9 

NEW PAGE

254  S4, Figure 1D). All the mutation forms of bases and amino acids in MSTN and FGF5 
255  genes are shown in Figure 1E and Figure 1F, respectively. These results indicate that 
256  increasing the delivery molar ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from 1:2 to 1:10 can 
257  greatly improve the efficiency of biallelic mutation in sheep. 
258  3.2 The MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep highlights a dominant 
259  “double-muscle” phenotype and muscle fiber hyperplasia 
260  Among gene-edited sheep, a sheep with biallelic deletion of MSTN and biallelic 
261  mutation of FGF5 aroused our great interest. Specifically, gene editing caused a 
262  deletion of 3-base pairs of AGC in the third exon of MSTN (Figure 1E, F), resulting in 
263  the deletion of cysteine at amino acid position 273 (MSTNDel273C) (Figure 1 E, F), 
264  which is highlighted by the “double-muscle” phenotype (Figure 2A, 2B). At the same 
265  time, a biallelic mutation in FGF5 caused the knockout of FGF5 gene and increased 
266  the  density  and  length  of  hairs  (Zhang  et  al.,  2020).  Given  the  prominent 
267  “double-muscle” phenotype of MF-/- sheep, we examined its histological morphology 
268  of the gluteus medius and longissimus dorsi, and found that the fiber cell number per 
269  unit area of muscle tissue in MF-/- sheep was significant (P<0.01) higher than that in 
270  WT sheep (Figure 2C, D). Further, we also found that the percentage of smaller 
271  myofiber in the gluteus medius and longissimus dorsi was clear higher in MF-/- sheep 
272  than that in WT sheep, whereas the percentage of larger muscle fiber area was lower 
273  (Figure 2C, E, F). To determine whether this phenomenon was affected by FGF5 gene 
274  mutation,  we  also  separately  examined  the  muscle  fiber  morphology  in  FGF5 
275  knockout sheep alone and found that FGF5 knockout alone had no significant (P>0.05) 
276  effect  on  muscle  fiber  size  (Figure  S1).  All  these  results  demonstrated  that  the 
277  dual-gene biallelic mutation MF-/- sheep had well-developed hip muscles with smaller 
278  muscle fibers, and this phenotype was dominated by MSTN gene.

280  To further determine the heritability of the above phenotypes, we crossed MF-/- 
281  sheep with homozygous WT sheep to produce the offspring generation of MF-/- sheep, 
282  which were identified that the gene editing could be stably inherited to the offspring, 
283  and they were all mutant heterozygotes of MSTN and FGF5 monoalleles (MF+/-) 
284  (Figure  S2).  Subsequently,  3  WT  sheep  and  4  MF+/-  sheep  were  slaughtered. 
285  Compared to WT sheep, the proportion of rib meat was significantly reduced in MF+/- 
286  sheep, and the proportion of hind leg meat was significantly increased, the ratio of 
287  hind leg meat increased by 21.2% (Table 1). Further, the muscle weight of different 
288  parts in WT and MF+/- sheep has no significant difference (Table S5). However, the 
289  proportion of gluteus medius in the carcass of MF+/- sheep was significantly (P<0.01) 
290  increased, with a 26.3% increase compared to WT sheep (Figure 2G). In addition, 
291  there were no significant (P>0.05) differences in pH, color, drip loss, cooking loss, 
292  shearing force, and amino acid content of the longissimus dorsi between WT and 
293  MF+/- sheep (Table S6-8). Compared with WT sheep, the cross-sectional area of 
294  gluteus medius muscle fibers in MF+/- sheep was also smaller (Figure 2H-I), and the 
295  number of muscle fiber cells per unit area was significantly increased (P<0.001) 
296  (Figure 2H, J); the percentage of smaller muscle fiber area in MF+/- sheep was 
297  significantly increased (P<0.05), while the percentage of larger muscle fiber area was 
298  significantly decreased (P<0.05) (Figure 2H, K), these results was consistent with that 
299  in MF-/- sheep. All these results demonstrated that the dual-gene biallelic editing of 
300  the  MSTN  and  FGF5  could  be  stably  inherited  by  the  offspring,  and  the  later 
301  generation characterized excellent traits of high-yield meat. 
302  3.3 The MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout promotes skeletal muscle 
303  satellite cells proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation 
304  Given  that  the  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  produced  the 
305  phenotype of “double-muscle” and reduced muscle fiber cross-sectional area, we 
11 

NEW PAGE

306  detected the in-situ expression of MSTN protein. The results showed that there was no 
307  significant  differential  expression  of  MSTN  protein  in  both  gluteus  medius  and 
308  longissimus dorsi of MF-/- sheep compared with WT sheep (Figure S3A). Also, there 
309  was no significant difference in MSTN mRNA (Figure S3B) and protein expression 
310  (FigureS3C-D)  in  gluteus  medius  of  WT  and  MF+/-  sheep.  Further 
311  immunofluorescence  also  revealed  no  significant  difference  in  MSTN  protein 
312  expression in both myoblasts and myotubes (Figure S3E). These results suggested that 
313  the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout does not affect the normal expression 
314  of MSTN. 
315  The proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells is a key step 
316  in  muscle  formation  and  development.  The  CCK-8  and  EdU  cell  proliferation 
317  experiments showed that the proliferative rate of MF+/- cells were highly significantly 
318  (P<0.01) elevated (Figure 3A) with a significant (P<0.05) increase in the rate of 
319  EdU-positive cells (Figure 3B, C) compared to WT cells. In addition, cell cycle 
320  detection showed a significant (P<0.01) reduce in the proportion of G1 phase and a 
321  significant increase (P<0.05) in the proportion of S phase in MF+/- cells (Figure 3D, 
322  E). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression levels of the cell cycle marker genes CyclinB1, 
323  CDK4,  Cyclin  A1,  Cyclin  E1,  and  CDK2 were significantly  increased  (P<0.05) 
324  (Figure 3F). These results suggest that the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout 
325  may promote cell proliferation by accelerating the cell cycle from G0/G1 phase to S 
326  phase. 
327  Although the mRNA levels of MyoD1 and MyoG were significantly increased 
328  after induced differentiation 2 days in MF+/- cells (Figure 3G), the mRNA level of 
329  MyHC (Figure 3G) and the protein levels of MyoD1, MyoG, and MyHC (Figure 3H, 
330  I) were dramatically decreased (P<0.05), suggesting that the MSTNDel273C mutation 
331  with  FGF5  inhibit  myogenic  differentiation.  Meanwhile,  the  immunofluorescence 
332  staining of MyoG and MyHC in myotubes showed that myotube fusion index (Figure 
333  3J, K), number of myotubes (Figure 3J, L), and number of nuclei per myotube (Figure 
334  3J, M) were all highly significantly (P<0.01) reduced after inducing differentiation for 
335  2 days of MF+/- cells compared to WT cells, as was the myotube diameter at the 
336  maximum measured (Figure 3J, N). To continue follow-up tracing of the progression 
12 

NEW PAGE

337  of  myogenic  differentiation,  we  also  performed  MyoG  and  MyHC 
338  immunofluorescence staining after inducing differentiation for 4 days (DM4) and 6 
339  days (DM6), and the results showed that the differentiation capacity and fusion ability 
340  of MF+/- cells were consistently significantly lower than WT cells during the ongoing 
341  differentiation process, as was the diameter of fused myotubes (Figure S4A-J). The 
342  reduced expression of myogenic differentiation markers further confirmed that the 
343  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  consistently  inhibits  myogenic 
344  differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (Figure S4K-N). Taken together, our 
345  results  elucidated  that  the  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  inhibits 
346  myogenic  differentiation  of  skeletal  muscle  satellite  cells  and  induces  a  smaller 
347  myotube diameter of myotubes after induced differentiation, which may explain why 
348  the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers is decreased in MF-/- and MF+/- sheep. 
349  3.4  FOSL1  is  a  key  gatekeeper  of  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5 
350  knockout-mediated muscle phenotype 
351  To elucidate the potential mechanism of the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 
352  knockout result in smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional area and myotube diameter, 
353  the  RNA-seq  was  performed  in  gluteus  medius.  A  total  of  25,958  genes  were 
354  identified by RNA-seq, and principal component analysis (PCA) showed relatively 
355  well repeatability within sample groups and well discrimination between WT and 
356  MF+/- samples (Figure 4A). With P-value < 0.05 and | log2 Fold Change | > 1 as the 
357  screening  criterion,  295  differentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  were  screened, 
358  including 79 up-regulated DEGs and 216 down-regulated DEGs (Figure 4B). The 
359  cluster analysis showed that the samples were clustered into WT groups and MF+/- 
360  groups, with obvious differences between groups (Figure 4C). Pearson correlation 
361  analysis also showed high similarity within sample groups (Figure 4D).  
362  GO enrichment analysis showed that 295 DEGs were significantly enriched in 
363  signal transduction, positive regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of cell 
364  migration, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, muscle contraction, cardiac muscle 
365  contraction, and positive regulation of JNK cascade and so on in biological process 
366  (BP); in cellular component (CC), these DEGs mainly belonged to cell membrane, 
367  cytoplasm, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, and I band; and molecular function (MF) 
13 

NEW PAGE

368  mainly included protein binding, nucleotide binding, ATP binding, and protein kinase 
369  activity (Figure 4E), indicating that these DEGs are significantly closely related to 
370  cell proliferation, myogenic differentiation, and muscle development. In addition, 
371  KEGG enrichment analysis showed that 295 DEGs were significantly enriched in 
372  cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling 
373  pathway,  and  TNF  signaling  pathway  (Figure  4F),  implying  that  DEGs  were 
374  significantly  associated  with  cell  proliferation,  differentiation,  apoptosis,  and 
375  inflammation. Furthermore, based on GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, 18 genes 
376  with a large difference were selected from 295 DEGs for validation at mRNA level in 
377  gluteus  medius.  The  results  showed  that  GLIS1  was  significantly  (P<0.05) 
378  up-regulated, and MYL10, FOSL1, PDPN, PLA1A, and ANKRD2 were significantly 
379  (P<0.05) down-regulated (Figure 4G). 
380  In addition, we also verified the above six DEGs in the longissimus dorsi, in 
381  which FOSL1, PDPN and ANKRD2 were significantly (P<0.05) reduced in MF+/- 
382  sheep (Figure S5A). Given that MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout promotes 
383  skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and inhibits differentiation, we dynamically 
384  monitored  the  expression  of  FOSL1,  PDPN,  and  ANKRD2  during  myogenic 
385  differentiation. The results indicated that both PDPN and ANKRD2 were significantly 
386  (P<0.05)  up-regulated  during  myogenic  differentiation  (Figure  S5B-C).  More 
387  strikingly,  FOSL1  mRNA  level  was  strongly  (P<0.01)  decreased  after  induced 
388  differentiation  (Figure  5A),  and  its  expression  diminished  continuously  with  the 
389  differentiation progress. Furthermore, compared with WT cells, the mRNA expression 
390  levels of FOSL1 in MF+/- cells at GM and DM2 were significantly (P<0.05) elevated 
391  (Figure 5B), suggesting that FOSL1 may play a crucial role in the proliferation and 
392  myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells. 
393  As aforementioned above, the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Fos 
394  inhibits  myogenesis  and  MyoD1  expression  by  directly  binding  to  the  MyoD1 
395  promoter region. Given that FOSL1 is a member of the AP-1 family, we, therefore, 
396  speculated  that  FOSL1  might  have  similar  functions  to  c-Fos.  Subsequent 
397  protein-protein  interaction  (PPI)  analysis  of  FOSL1,  c-Fos  and  MyoD1  further 
398  suggested that there was a potential interaction between FOSL1 and MyoD1 (Figure 
14 

NEW PAGE

399  5C). In addition, we also found that the mRNA expression level of c-Fos was highly 
400  significantly (P<0.01) reduced in MF+/- myoblasts compared with WT cells, whereas 
401  the expression level of MyoD1 mRNA was dramatically (P<0.01) increased (Figure 
402  5D). Given the physical interaction between c-Fos and MyoD1, the JASPAR database 
403  (https://jaspar.genereg.net/) was used to predict the binding of FOSL1 to MyoD1 
404  promoter region, and found that two bZIP recognition sites in the MyoD1 promoter 
405  region had the most significant binding potential to FOSL1, of which motif 1 located 
406  in the -1839 to -1830 region and motif 2 was located in the -1273 to -1264 region 
407  (Figure 5E-G). Subsequently, ChIP-qPCR confirmed that FOSL1 directly binds to 
408  these  two  bZIP  recognition  sites  in  the  MyoD1  promoter  region  (Figure  5H-I), 
409  indicating that FOSL1 plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of 
410  MyoD1. 
411  3.5  The  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  contribute  to  muscle 
412  phenotype via MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis 
413  As  previously  mentioned,  FOSL1  may  be  a  key  gatekeeper  of  MSTNDel273C 
414  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout-mediated  muscle  phenotype.  Given  that,  we  also 
415  investigated the protein levels of FOSL1 and c-Fos in GM and MD2, respectively. The 
416  results showed that the protein level of FOSL1 was significantly (P<0.05) reduced 
417  and c-Fos protein levels were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in MF+/- cells at GM 
418  compared  with  WT  cells  (Figure  6A-B),  whereas  FOSL1  protein  levels  were 
419  significantly (P<0.05) diminished and c-Fos protein levels were highly significantly 
420  (P<0.01) elevated in MF+/- cells after induced differentiation (Figure 6F-G), which 
421  further  demonstrated  the  key  role  of  FOSL1  on  myogenesis.  As  demonstrated 
422  previously, enrichment analysis significantly enriched the MAPK signaling pathway. 
423  Compared with WT cells, the p-FOSL1 protein level of MF+/- cells was strongly 
424  increased at GM (P<0.01) (Figure 6A-B), and there was no significant (P>0.05) 
425  difference between MEK1/2 and p-MEK1/2 protein levels (Figure 6A, C), but its 
426  downstream ERK1/2 protein level was extremely significantly (P<0.01) decreased, 
427  and  accompanied  by  a  significant  (P<0.05)  increase  in  p-ERK1/2  protein  levels 
428  (Figure 6A, D). In addition, there was no significant (P>0.05) difference in p38 
429  MAPK  protein  level,  but  p-p38  MAPK  protein  level  was  significantly  (P<0.05) 
15 

NEW PAGE

430  enhanced  (Figure 6A,  E).  After  induced  differentiation,  there  was  no  significant 
431  (P>0.05) difference in p-FOSL1 protein level in MF+/- cells compared with WT cells 
432  (Figure 6F-G), although both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 protein levels were dramatically 
433  (P<0.01)  inhibited,  there  was  no  significant  (P>0.05)  difference  in  their 
434  phosphorylated protein levels (Figure 6F, H-I). In addition, with a strong (P<0.01) 
435  decrease in the p38 MAPK protein level, the p-p38 MAPK protein level dramatically 
436  (P<0.01) increased (Figure 6F, J). These results suggested that MSTNDel273C mutation 
437  with FGF5 knockout may regulate the expression and activity of FOSL1 via the 
438  MEK1/2-ERK1/2-FOSL1 axis to affect the proliferation and myogenic differentiation 
439  of skeletal muscle satellite cells. 
440  To  investigate  the  role  of  FOSL1  on  the  proliferation  and  myogenic 
441  differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells, we successfully constructed FOSL1 
442  gain-of-function model (Figure 7A, G-H). Our results showed that overexpression of 
443  FOSL1 significantly (P<0.01) increased the cell proliferation rate (Figure 7B), and the 
444  mRNA expression levels of cell proliferation-related marker genes also significantly 
445  (P<0.05) increased (Figure 7C). Meanwhile, the EdU cell proliferation assay further 
446  demonstrated the promoting effect of FOSL1 overexpression on cell proliferation 
447  (Figure 7D-E). Similarly, we also investigated the expression of c-Fos and MyoD1, 
448  respectively.  As  anticipated,  the  overexpression  of  FOSL1  inhibited  the  MyoD1 
449  mRNA  (P<0.01)  and  protein  (P<0.05)  expression  levels  (Figure  7F,  G-H),  and 
450  significantly (P<0.05) suppressed mRNA expression level of c-Fos (Figure 7F), and 
451  we also observed a significant (P<0.01) increase in the expression level of p-FOSL1 
452  protein (Figure 7G-H). These results are consistent with what we observed in MF+/- 
453  cells at GM, suggesting a potential inhibitory effect of p-FOSL1 protein levels on 
454  MyoD1. 
455  In addition, we also investigated the effect of FOSL1over-expression on cell 
456  differentiation. Although the mRNA expression level of MyoG was significantly 
457  increased (P<0.01) with an up-regulated tendency on MyoD1 mRNA, the expression 
458  level  of  MyHC  mRNA  was  significantly  (P<0.05)  reduced  after  FOSL1 
459  overexpression  (Figure  8A).  More  importantly,  the  protein  expression  levels  of 
460  MyoD1, MyoG and MyHC were all significantly decreased (P<0.05), proving that the 
16 

NEW PAGE

461  overexpression of FOSL1 inhibited the myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle 
462  satellite  cells.  Meanwhile,  the  p-FOSL1  protein  expression  level  was  also 
463  significantly (P<0.01) elevated with the increase of FOSL1 protein expression level 
464  (Figure  8B-C).  Subsequently,  immunofluorescence  staining  further  confirmed  the 
465  significant (P<0.05) inhibitory effect of FOSL1 overexpression on cell differentiation 
466  (Figure 8D-E). Also, the number of myotubes, the number of nuclei per myotube, and 
467  the myotube diameter all significantly decreased (P<0.05) (Figure 8D, F-H). These 
468  results further demonstrated that elevated p-FOSL1 protein level inhibits myogenic 
469  differentiation and produces smaller myotubes. 
470  To further ascertain this insight, the tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), which can 
471  strongly activate ERK1/2 and increase p-ERK1/2 protein expression level, was used 
472  to activate ERK1/2 and act as an indirect activator of FOSL1. As expected, the 
473  addition  of  20  μM  TBHQ  significantly  (P<0.01)  inhibited  the  myogenic 
474  differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (Figure 8I-J). And, the number of 
475  myotubes was significantly increased (P<0.05) (Figure 8I, K), while the number of 
476  nuclei per myotube was significantly (P<0.05) decreased and produced a smaller 
477  myotube diameter (P<0.05) (Figure 8I, L-M). Taken together, these results repeatedly 
478  confirm  that  FOSL1  as  a  key  gatekeeper  of  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5 
479  knockout-mediated muscle phenotype. 
480  In  short,  our  results  shed  light  that  the  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5 
481  knockout  mediated the activation  of FOSL1 via MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis, further 
482  promotes  skeletal  muscle  satellite  cell  proliferation,  and  inhibits  myogenic 
483  differentiation by inhibiting the transcription of MyoD1, and resulting in smaller 
484  myotubes (Figure 9). Our results demonstrate the potential mechanism for smaller 
485  muscle fibers of MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep. 
486  4 Discussion 
487  4.1 Optimized Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA delivery ratio improves the efficiency of 
488  dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations 
489  The strategy for producing gene knockout animals by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing 
490  system is usually to introduce the Cas9 mRNA and the sgRNA of the target gene into 
17 

NEW PAGE

491  their prokaryotic embryos by microinjection. However, this “one-step” method often 
492  results in a “mosaic” of gene-edited offspring, that is, due to the fertilized egg will 
493  divide into multiple blastomeres successively many times, the editing ability and 
494  editing mode of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for each blastomere may be different, 
495  thereby resulting in the occurrence of chimeric mutant individuals carrying both the 
496  wild-type and mutant alleles (Wan et al., 2015). Such chimeric mutants have now 
497  been reported in gene knockout mice (Wang et al., 2013), rats (Bao et al., 2015), 
498  monkeys (Niu et al., 2014), pigs (Hai et al., 2014), sheep (Hongbing HAN, 2014), 
499  goats (Wang et al., 2015), rabbits (Lv et al., 2016), and humans (Wang and Yang, 
500  2019) prepared by a “one-step” method using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. For studies 
501  involved  in  genetic  phenotypes,  chimeric  gene  knockout  animals  require  further 
502  cross-breeding to obtain animals with a complete knockout of the target gene. Once 
503  required  to  generate  multiple  gene  knockout  animals,  this  time-consuming  and 
504  laborious operation will become extremely difficult. Although many studies have 
505  been devoted to eliminating this widespread chimeric mutation (Sato et al., 2015; 
506  Sung et al., 2014; Kotani et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014; Tu et al., 
507  2017;  Wang  et  al.,  2015), however,  these  optimizations  did  not  bring  about  a 
508  significant improvement in the production efficiency of biallelic knockout animals. 
509  Here, we increased the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from 1:2 to 1:10, 
510  which improve the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of the biallelic gene. This 
511  unprecedented optimization method not only improved the overall gene knockout 
512  efficiency, but also the obtained gene-edited offspring were all dual-gene biallelic 
513  mutation. 
514  4.2 Phenotypes produced by MSTN mutations are mutation site-dependent 
515  As mentioned previously, although MSTN mutations have been found to produce 
516  a “double-muscle” phenotype in multiple species, the microscopic phenotypes are 
517  different, and this difference is closely related to the mutation site and species types. 
518  In mice, the number of skeletal muscle fibers with MSTN gene knockout significantly 
519  increased by 86% (McPherron et al., 1997). A missense mutant MSTN only increased 
520  the number of mouse  muscle fibers, while dominant negative MSTN resulted  in 
521  increased muscle fiber cross-sectional area in mice, but not the number of muscle 
18 

NEW PAGE

522  fibers (Nishi et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2000). In addition, the use of MSTN neutralizing 
523  antibody on adult rats also resulted in an increased muscle fiber cross-sectional area 
524  (Haidet et al., 2008). In cattle, natural MSTN mutant Belgian Blue cattle had an 
525  increased number of muscle fibers and reduced muscle fiber diameter (Wegner et al., 
526  2000). The muscle fiber cross-sectional area of longissimus dorsi and gluteus medius 
527  in sheep was significantly increased after a 4bp deletion of the first exon of MSTN 
528  (Zhiliang et al., 2004). In pigs, both the MSTN gene-edited Meishan and Hubei pigs 
529  showed a phenotype with increased muscle fiber density (Qian et al., 2015; Xu et al., 
530  2013). Here, we prepared MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep with 
531  3-base pairs of AGC in the third exon of MSTN, which caused the deletion of cysteine 
532  at  amino  acid  position  273.  Its  macroscopic  phenotype  is similar to  that  of  the 
533  MSTN-edited sheep with the first exon knocked out 4-base pairs. Both of them 
534  showed an abnormally developed “double-muscle” phenotype of hip muscle, but the 
535  microscopic phenotype was exactly the opposite. 
536  4.3 The phenotype of MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep is only 
537  controlled by MSTN 
538  Although we produced the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep, 
539  FGF5  is  currently  recognized  to  be  an  important  regulator  of  hair  growth  and 
540  development and there is no direct evidence of a potential regulatory role of FGF5 on 
541  muscle development (Xu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Higgins et al., 2014; Hebert 
542  et al., 1994). Furthermore, there is no evidence of the crosstalk between MSTN and 
543  FGF5. Importantly, we also did not find a significant effect on muscle fiber phenotype 
544  in muscle morphological analysis of FGF5 knockout alone sheep. These evidence 
545  support whether it is homozygous mutant F0 generation or heterozygous mutant F1 
546  generation, the reduction of muscle fiber cross-sectional area of MSTNDel273C mutation 
547  with FGF5 knockout sheep is only controlled by MSTN, whereas not FGF5. These 
548  results indicate that MSTN may control skeletal muscle weight from two relatively 
549  independent  aspects  regulating  the  number  of  muscle  fibers  during  embryonic 
550  development and the muscle fiber size after birth. 
551  4.4 The MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout activate FOSL1 and promote 
552  cell proliferation

553  The proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells is a key step 
554  in myogenesis and muscle development, which is a highly coordinated multistep 
555  biological process driven by many myogenic regulatory factors such as paired box 
556  families  (Pax3/7),  myogenic  regulatory  factors  (Myogenin,  MyoD,  Myf5,  and 
557  MRF4/6),  myocyte  enhancer  factor  2  (MEF2)  family  proteins,  these  factors 
558  collectively regulate the expression of muscle specific genes and to control skeletal 
559  muscle development (Braun and Gautel, 2011). Aside from  myogenic regulatory 
560  factor, MSTN has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in the proliferation 
561  (Thomas et al., 2000b; Taylor et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2007; Ge et al., 2020) and 
562  differentiation (Langley et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2020) of skeletal muscle satellite cells. 
563  MSTN negatively regulates the G1/S phase transition of cell cycle by specifically 
564  up-regulating cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1, and reducing the 
565  level  and  activity  of  Cyclin-dependent  kinase  2  (CDK2)  protein  in  myoblasts 
566  (Thomas et al., 2000a; Joulia et al., 2003; McCroskery et al., 2003), resulting in the 
567  arrest of myoblasts in G1 phase of cell cycle, so as to maintain the static state of 
568  satellite cells. In this study, the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout promoted 
569  the transformation of G1/S phase by reducing the proportion of cell cycle G1 phase 
570  and increasing the proportion of S phase, resulting in the activation of skeletal muscle 
571  satellite cells and entry into the cell cycle, and further promoting cell proliferation. 
572  Furthermore, FOSL1 has been repeatedly proved to promote the proliferation of a 
573  variety of cells, especially tumor cells (Sobolev et al., 2022; Talotta et al., 2020). In 
574  the current study, the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout led to the increase 
575  of p-FOSL1 level, and the over-expression of FOSL1 also promoted cell proliferation, 
576  suggesting that the activated FOSL1 is a key factor in the proliferation of skeletal 
577  muscle satellite cells. Altogether, our results support that the MSTNDel273C mutation 
578  with FGF5 knockout promotes the proliferation of skeletal muscle satellite cells by 
579  activating FOSL1. 
580  4.5 FOSL1 binds to the MyoD1 promoter and inhibits its transcription. 
581  In this study, AP-1 family member FOSL1 was significantly reduced in MF+/- 
582  sheep, and its expression were drastically reduced during myogenic differentiation, 
583  which  was  consistent  with  the  decrease  of  FOSL1  expression  during  C2C12 
20 

NEW PAGE

584  differentiation (Tobin et al., 2016). Therefore, FOSL1 was recognized as a potential 
585  gatekeeper. As mentioned previously, c-Fos, a member of the AP-1 transcription 
586  factor  family,  has been  shown  to inhibit  myogenesis  and  MyoD1  expression  by 
587  directly binding to the MyoD1 promoter region (Li et al., 1992). Moreover, FOSL1 
588  heterodimerizes with other transcription factors, such as the members of the bZIP 
589  family, and these dimers are either disabling the transcriptional activator complex or 
590  saving the interacting proteins from degradation in proteasomes (Sobolev et al., 2022). 
591  Therefore, we speculate that FOSL1 may have similar functions to c-Fos. PPI analysis 
592  of FOSL1, c-Fos and MyoD1 suggested a potential interaction between FOSL1 and 
593  MyoD1.  Subsequently,  we  confirmed  that  FOSL1  directly  binds  to  two  bZIP 
594  recognition sites in the MyoD1 promoter region. Meanwhile, the overexpression of 
595  FOSL1 confirmed the potential inhibitory effect of FOSL1 and p-FOSL1 on MyoD1. 
596  In  addition,  FOSL2,  another  AP-1  family  member,  can  also  inhibit  myoblast 
597  differentiation (Alli et al., 2013), which may support the inhibitory effect of FOSL1 
598  on myogenic differentiation. In a word, these results fully support our hypothesis that 
599  FOSL1 binds the MyoD1 promoter and inhibits its transcription. 
600  4.6  The  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  contribute  to  muscle 
601  phenotype via MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis 
602  MSTN dimer first binds to ActRIIB, and then binds to ALK4/5 to form  a 
603  complex. Smad2/3/4 enters the nucleus to regulate the expression of target genes, and 
604  different  transcription  factors  bind  to  Smad2/3/4  complex,  resulting  in  different 
605  functions of Smad signaling pathway (Chen et al., 2021b). The nonclassical pathway 
606  of MSTN involves PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, 
607  which mainly includes ERKs, JNKs and p38 MAPK (Huang et al., 2007; Gui et al., 
608  2012). All of those pathways are involved in the signal transduction pathway of 
609  MSTN and mediate the transcription of MRFs (Myogenin, Myf5, MyoD), MuRF-1 
610  and Atrogin-1, to regulate myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle quality (Chen 
611  et al., 2021b).  
612  MSTN induces muscle fiber hypertrophy prior to satellite cell activation (Wang 
613  and  McPherron,  2012)  and  inhibits  IGF-I-induced  increase  in  myotube  diameter 
614  through Akt signaling pathway (Morissette et al., 2009). Recently, a study on the 
21 

NEW PAGE

615  downstream  target  gene  Smad2  of  MSTN  showed  that  the  knock-out  of  Smad2 
616  expression  in  primary  myoblasts  did  not  affect  the  efficiency  of  myogenic 
617  differentiation,  but  produced  smaller  myotubes  with  reduced  expression  of  the 
618  terminal  differentiation  marker  myogenin.  In  turn,  the  overexpression  of  Smad2 
619  stimulated the expression of myogenin and enhanced cell differentiation and fusion 
620  (Lamarche et al., 2021). In our study, the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout 
621  resulted in the inhibition of myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells, 
622  and the number of myotubes and the myotube size were significantly reduced. 
623  As  previously  described,  the  DEGs  of  gluteus  medius  RNA-seq  were 
624  significantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. A recent study on glioma 
625  showed that FOSL1 can be activated by the Ras-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 axis in MAPK 
626  signaling pathway (Marques et al., 2021). Similarly, the activated MEK1/2-ERK1/2 
627  axis in aged skeletal muscle also activates FOSL1 and increases the abundance of 
628  FOSL1 and the trans-activation capacity of the Fos-Jun heterodimer (Mathes et al., 
629  2021). In our study, the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout regulates FOSL1 
630  expression and activity through MEK1/2-ERK1/2-FOSL1 axis and activated FOSL1 
631  further inhibits myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells, resulting in 
632  smaller  myotube  diameter.  However,  puzzlingly,  despite  the  high  expression  of 
633  p-FOSL1 in MF+/-  myoblasts,  it did not significantly inhibit the  transcription  of 
634  MyoD1, which may be related to a dramatic enhance in c-Fos, or there might be other 
635  signaling  pathways  regulating  MyoD1  after  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5 
636  knockout. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of MEK1/2 using 
637  MEK1/2-specific  inhibitor  PD184352  can  significantly  down-regulate  FOSL1 
638  expression (Mathes et al., 2021). To further confirm our hypothesis, TBHQ was used 
639  to activate ERK1/2 and act as an indirect activator of FOSL1. Interestingly, activated 
640  FOSL1 markedly inhibited myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells, 
641  which also resulted in smaller myotubes, but significantly increased the number of 
642  myotubes. Taken together, these results shed light on the potential mechanisms by 
643  which  MSTNDel273C  mutation  with  FGF5  knockout  leads  to  increased  myofiber 
644  numbers and decreased fiber cross-sectional area. 
645  5 Conclusion 
22 

NEW PAGE

646  In this study, we found that increasing the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to 
647  sgRNA can improve the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of the biallelic gene. 
648  Based on this, we generated a MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep, a 
649  dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutant, which highlights a dominant “double-muscle” 
650  phenotype.  Both  F0  and  F1  generation  mutants  highlight  the  excellent  trait  of 
651  high-yield meat and the more number of muscle fibers per unit area. Our results 
652  suggested the MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout mediated the activation of 
653  FOSL1 via MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis, further promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell 
654  proliferation, and inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the transcription of 
655  MyoD1, and resulting in smaller myotubes. This supports the myofiber hyperplasia 
656  that more number of muscle fibers and smaller cross sectional area, caused by the 
657  MSTNDel273C mutation with FGF5 knockout.
