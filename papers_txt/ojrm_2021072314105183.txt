1. Introduction 
Diabetic foot infections have been an increasingly common problem globally 
due to the sustained rise in new incidences of diabetes and the increasing body 
weight of diabetic patients [1] [2]. They usually arise either as a skin ulceration 
caused by a sensory or motor peripheral neuropathy or as a trauma-induced 
wound [1]. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) complications are the main reason for di-
abetes-related hospitalizations and lower extremity amputations [1]. In the United 
States, DFUs constitute two-thirds of all non-traumatic amputations [3]; while 
in Lebanon, 80% of patients with DFUs undergo a lower limb amputation [4]. It 
is considered a major public health issue because it negatively impacts patients 
physically and emotionally and involves a large proportion of costs to the medi-
cal system and society [1] [3]. 
Patients with open wounds require particular local-wound care [5]. Following 
tissue injury, cellular and chemotactic factors promote the migration of fibrob-
lasts, macrophages, keratinocytes, and platelets to the site of injury accompanied 
with endothelial cell recruitment that is essential for angiogenesis [6] [7] [8]. The 
process of wound healing is characterized to be a linear pathway that starts with 
the achievement of hemostasis, followed consecutively by inflammation, epithe-
lialization, and fibroplasia to complete the healing process [9] [10]. In order to 
manage and maintain wound healing, the cells release growth factors (GF) and 
cytokines, such as VEGF, FGF2, TGF-β, etc. [11]. 
Although many topical agents and wound maintenance interventions are meant 
to improve the wound healing environment, such as debridement, hyperbaric 
oxygen therapy, ultrasound and electromagnetic energy [9] [10], negative pres-
sure wound therapy [11], extracellular matrix products and cellular-based tissue 
technologies [12], etc. unfortunately data is lacking to support any definitive 
protocols for DFU healing.  
In the past decade, various studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic use 
of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was successful as a basic sealing and hemostatic 
therapeutic tool in plastic surgery especially in oral, hand, and aesthetic surgery 
[12] [13] [14]. However, many limitations in PRP therapy, such as the associa-
tion of anti-coagulants, have the benefits and clinical outcomes of PRP use in the 
treatment of chronic ulcers, resulting in the inhibition of the wound healing 
process [15] [16]. Thus, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) was developed as an easy to 
prepare, nontoxic, and biocompatible platelet-based therapeutic alternative [17] 
[18]. Also known as “Glue Therapy”, PRF used as a cell scaffold was proposed as 
an effective approach to promote and repair wound healing [6]. PRF is a platelet 
concentrate collected on a single fibrin membrane that contains all the constitu-
ents favorable for healing. The scientific rationale behind the use of platelet prep-
arations lies in the fact that platelets serve as a reservoir for numerous growth 
factors that are known to play a crucial role in hard-tissue and soft-tissue healing 
processes [7]. Intact platelets contained within a fibrin matrix release a relatively 
constant concentration of growth factors over a period of 7 days, stimulating 
human osteoblastic proliferation. An effect on neoangiogenesis also has been

shown through histology. In a membrane form, platelet can be used as a fibrin 
bandage that serves as a matrix to accelerate the healing of wound edges [8]. 
Platelets are considered to play an important role in the healing process of 
wounds, as they release GFs upon activation following their pulverization on the 
wound bed within the first hour [19]. These GFs contribute to the repair of in-
jured tissues through promoting angiogenesis, synthesis of extracellular matrix 
components like collagen, laminin, and integrin, and interestingly via inducing a 
re-epithelization of the injured site [12] [20]. 
Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been used in many clinical tri-
als and applications giving rise to various differentiated cell lineages [13]. MSCs 
can be collected from bone marrow, umbilical cords [14], and from adipose tis-
sue (ADMSC), which is a less invasive and painful method than harvesting hu-
man bone marrow [21]. MSC-based therapies are also promising alternatives to 
treat tissue loss diseases through their high proliferation potential and cytokine 
and growth factor secretions known to be essential for organ homeostasis and 
tissue repair [17]. Like platelets, MSCs also promote healing in DFUs by secret-
ing GFs, which play a role in reducing inflammation and promoting angiogene-
sis within the wound [21]. 
In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of ADMSCs embedded in autologous 
PRF on the chronic DFU healing process compared to autologous PRF treat-
ment alone. We propose our protocol as a potentially new cost-effective thera-
peutic approach with better and faster outcomes than traditional chronic wound 
healing treatments. 
2. Material and Methods 
2.1. Study Design and Patient Selection 
This is a retrospective, experimental study. Ten patients with chronic DFU were 
divided into two groups (each n = 5): Group A (pure PRF) and Group B 
(ADMSC + PRF). The administration of treatment took place on an outpatient 
basis without the need for hospital admission. Between two and three sessions 
were performed per patient (once a week). All participants were aged between 53 
and 93 years old (median age ± 71 years old) and were refractory to the usual 
conservative DFU treatments, such as enzymatic and antibiotic debriding sub-
stances and various hydrocolloid dressings. There were no exclusion criteria; 
all patients with diabetic foot ulcers were included even those with infected 
wounds.  
All procedures conducted during the study were carried out in compliance 
with institutional ethical standards. Reviva Regenerative Medicine Center and 
the Middle East Institute of Health-University Hospital Ethics Review Boards 
approved the retrieval of all MSC and PRF collections (Approval Reference 
Number CTU-009-15) and all patients were asked to read, approve, and sign an 
informed consent form prior to any participation. 
To evaluate ulcer progression and examine the regenerative power of the PRF, 
we used the “Zaragoza 1-4” scale: Table 1.

4  Complete healing  Excellent 
2.2. Preparation of Autologous PRF 
We used the Vivostat® PRF system, an automated system for efficient prepara-
tion and application of autologous PRF in wound treatment. Blood (120 mL) 
was drawn into a preparation unit, anticoagulants were added, and the whole 
preparation unit was double-centrifuged to obtain 5 mL of plasma rich in 
growth factors and autologous fibrin (concentration 20 mg/mL). This process 
took approximately 23 minutes (min). Samples were then taken for culture of 
the wounds and the ulcers were disinfected using a normal saline and chlorhex-
idine 2% wash. Photographs were taken to allow monitoring of the course of 
treatment. (Note: No thrombin or bovine components were added to the Vivos-
tat® PRF at any time.) 
2.3. Mesenchymal Stem Cell Collection 
Patients underwent standard liposuction under good medical practice condi-
tions. Approximately 250 mL of fat mixed with local anesthetics was obtained. 
To isolate the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), lipoaspirates were washed in-
tensely with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% of penicillin, strep-
tomycin and amphotericin B (PSA). Next, the lipoaspirates were digested with 
an equal volume of 0.075% collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 - 60 min at 
37˚C with gentle agitation. The activity of the collagenase was neutralized with 
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine se-
rum (FBS; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). To 
obtain the high-density SVF pellet, the digested lipoaspirate was centrifuged at 
1200 g for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in DMEM containing 10% 
FBS and filtered through a 100 μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon). The filtered cells 
were centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 min. The resuspended SVF cells were plated at 
a density of 1 × 106/cm2 into T75 or T175 culture flasks. Non-adherent cells were 
removed 12 - 18 hours after initial plating by intensely washing the plates. The 
resulting fibroblastoid adherent cells, termed AT-derived fibroblastoid adherent 
cells, were cultivated at 37˚C at a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO.

The expansion medium consisted of Minimum Essential Medium Eagle − Alpha 
Modification (Alpha MEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and 5% penicillin-streptomycin- 
amphotericin  B  solution  (PSA:  Hyclone;  GE  healthcare,  Logan,  UT,  USA). 
ADMSCs were maintained in Alpha-MEM + 10% FBS and 5% PSA until they

reached 70% to 90% confluency. Cells were harvested at subconfluence using 
Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). 
2.4. Platelet Concentrate Functionality Evaluation 
TGF-β1, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF and FGF-2 were measured by ELISA. The 
supernatant and the antibody (monoclonal biotinyle) form a complex after the 
interaction of biotin and streptavidin during incubation for 60 min. The excess 
was eliminated by washing and then an enzyme-antibody complex was added. 
The complex antibody-enzyme formed the final sandwich complex. After incu-
bation, the excess was washed again. Afterwards, sulfuric acid was added to stop 
the reaction and the solution’s color transformed from blue to yellow. The color 
intensity was directly correlated to the concentration of samples. The absorbance 
was read at 450 nm. 
2.5. Flow Cytometry Analysis for ADMSC Characterization and   
Immunophenotyping   
For MSC surface marker immunophenotyping, cells were stained with the fol-
lowing conjugated antibodies: anti-CD45-vioblue, anti-CD34-PE, HLADr-vioblue, 
anti-CD73-PE, anti-CD90-FITC, anti-CD105-vioblue, CD24-PE, CD44-FITC, 
CD133-APC, CD14-PE and relevant isotypes (Miltenyi-Biotec). We acquired at 
least 20,000 events as test samples. 
2.6. Mesenchymal Stem Cells Embedded in PRF   
The platelet-rich fibrin obtained after preparation were mixed with 10 × 106 cells 
of ADMSC. 
2.7. Injection Procedure 
The Vivostat® PRF syringe was loaded in an Applicator Unit and applied on the 
wound with the Spraypen by a minimum distance of 5 cm from the problem 
area until it was well covered. The final dressing was with Bactigras® covered 
with a suitable antiperspirant. The dressing was not removed until the following 
session. 
3. Statistical Analysis 
Statistical significance was determined based on a paired T-test and one-way 
ANOVA test. P values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. 
Chi-square test was used to assess wound healing scores in the two groups. 
4. Results 
The present study was carried out with 10 patients selected from the outpatient 
department over a period of 1 year starting from April 2019 with DFUs. The pa-
tients were divided into Group A treated with PRF alone (n = 5) and Group B 
treated with PRF embedded in ADMSC (n = 5) (Table 2).

A significantly higher proportion of individuals in the ADMSC +PRF group 
had a better healing index when compared to the pure PRF group (P < 0.001) 
(Table 3). 
Hence, in the present study, DFU grafted with ADMSC + PRF showed a sta-
tistically significant difference in wound healing; however, clinical significance 
was also observed in the experimental group with pure PRF grafting. 
4.1. Platelet Concentrate in PRF 
The mean concentration of TGF-β1, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF and FGF-2 
secreted by the PRF were 12,500 pg/mg, 3200 pg/mg, 400 pg/mg, 28 pg/mg and 
4.2 pg/mg respectively compared to patient serum used as a control (CTR) 
(Figure 1). 
4.2. PRF Induces MSC Proliferation 
All patients showed multiple skin lesions with a median initial size of at least 5 
cm2, involving the dermis (Grade 1) and subcutaneous (Grade 2) layers. Micro-
biological assessment was positive in one case, in which antibiotics were added 
on to the PRF injection (Table 4). A complete response was observed in 4 pa-
tients after a mean of 3 sessions. The other 4 patient achieved a partial response. 
Two patients stopped the gel treatment too early due to low patient compliance or 
death (Figure 2). Pain disappeared in all cases after the 2nd gel application, 
while granulation tissue was observed after the first application in 3 patients 
with Grade 2 lesions (Figure 3, Figure 4) injected with PRF alone and 4 pa-
tients injected with PRF embedded in ADMSC (Table 4). No side effects were 
documented.

5. Discussion 
Several research studies have discussed DFU healing processes; however, most of 
these studies are focused on evaluating regular dressings, such as debridement, 
antibacterial agents, tulle dressing, polyurethane films, foam, etc. Over recent 
years, improvement in tissue regeneration therapy in Lebanon has involved the 
use of PRP in therapeutic processes as a valid application in reconstructive and 
aesthetic medicine. The therapeutic tool evolution of switching from PRP to PRF 
cell product has shown the robust potential of PRF as a hemostatic, anti-inflam- 
matory, and analgesic substance [18] [22]. MSC-based treatment also increases 
wound tensile strength, reduces scarring and wound contraction, and increases 
collagen secretion [23] associated with chronic inflammation from the anti-fibro- 
tic process. In our study, we showed that the candidates treated with their auto-
logous ADMSC embedded in PRF improved significantly with an efficient wound 
healing process (Figure 4) compared to their counterparts treated only with PRF 
(Figure 3). Interestingly, this is the first clinical study in Lebanon to explore the 
synergic role of MSCs with Vivostat® PRF product on DFU healing.  
Within our study, all DFU candidates received PRF injections, whether alone 
or with ADMSC, using the Vivostat® PRF system. The process for retrieving the 
fibrin from Vivostat® PRF provides a number of advantages compared with oth-
er automatic and manual systems used for obtaining PRF [24] [25]. First, the 
standardization of the PRP collection on Vivostat® PRF automated system pro-
vides a final product (PRP + autologous fibrin) stable in constitution indepen-

dently of collection time delays and variations in handling operators. Second, the 
closed system feature in Vivostat® PRF provides a sterile therapeutic product, 
which minimizes the risk of possible microbial infection after PRF application. 
Remarkably, the concentration of both PRP and fibrin recovered after a Vivostat 
run is nine times fold the plasmatic concentration threshold, which is a consi-
derably high value compared to other automatic PRF collection systems [22]. 
Eppley et al. performed a meta-analysis on three studies in which chronic ulc-
ers were treated with PRF for 8 to 10 weeks and recorded complete epitheliza-
tion of wounds in 81%, 93% and 100% of patients, respectively [26]. Similarly, 
our results showed good recovering scores after the completion of the PRF ap-
plications in four of the five candidates treated with PRF alone (Group A). One 
patient showed a low healing score, which may be correlated to the derived 
complication of his essential thrombocythemia. The mean concentration of 
TGF-β1, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF and FGF-2 secreted were statistically sig-
nificant and correlated positively with proper DFU wound healing. The an-
ti-bacterial properties attributed to PRF in other studies cannot be completely 
confirmed in our study, since only one candidate out of 10 showed a positive 
microbiological infection with Proteus mirabilis. Interestingly, the antibiotic ther-
apy against P. mirabilis infection was not a conclusive factor in obtaining a poor 
score of healing recovery. 
The five patients of Group B were injected with ADMSC embedded in PRF. 
Four candidates over five showed excellent wound healing scores (80%) and only 
one candidate showed a good wound healing score (20%) (Figure 4). It has been 
demonstrated that MSC-based treatments in wound healing reduced scarring, 
which may have accelerated the wound recovery and improved angiogenesis, 
modified collagen deposition, and paracrine signaling of MSCs [27]. Our results 
are consistent with many reports suggesting that MSCs secrete high levels of 
VEGF and HGF and maintain a higher ratio of TGF-β3 to TGF-β1, which con-
tributes to cell migration, proliferation, and regulates vascular angiogenesis, ma-
trix deposition, and degradation of wound healing; they also promote wound 
reepithelization and reduce scar formation [11]. FGF and HGF enhance the re-
generation of the dermis in acute incisional wounds [28]. Thus, an increased 
VEGF is associated with scarless repair [29], as in neutralization of TGF-β1 and 
TGF-β2 or an increase of TGF-β3 secretion. MSCs and PRF showed a high se-
cretion of TGF-ß1, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF, and FGF-2 (Figure 1) pro-
moting a fast wound healing in both groups. This is consistent with the latest 
theory stating that the therapeutic effects of MSCs are due to their paracrine ef-
fects and not due to their differentiation capacity. In fact, in the 2019 Caplan 
report [30], it was suggested to change the name of stem cells to medicinal sig-
naling cells. The array of secretion or secretome has multiple therapeutic effects 
such as anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic effects besides the 
many other roles such as promoting anti scaring 
Finally, our results suggest that in both groups, A and B, PRF and ADMSC

with PRF promoted wound healing in DFUs. We should highlight the fact that 
the promising results obtained in our study that platelet-derived growth factors 
can replace conventional treatments (antibiotic creams, and skin or flap grafts) 
as a front-line therapeutic option in the treatment of chronic DFUs should not 
necessarily be generalized. PRF associated with MSC factors are a hopeful treat-
ment protocol when conventional treatments are unsuccessful or when the pa-
tient refuses surgical options.  
6. Conclusions 
In conclusion, mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue and their se-
cretions embedded in PRF potentially appear to have a major role in wound 
healing in DFU. The Vivostat® PRF system was used as a clinical and therapeutic 
tool for wound healing applications in our patients. In the future, it would be 
very interesting to conduct a prospective study in a larger number of patients, to 
statistically validate the use of ADMSCs embedded in PRF for the treatment of 
chronic DFU. Further studies are also needed to elucidate the underlying me-
chanism of cross-talkingbetween MSC secretome components and platelets growth 
factors. 
Although many controversies have been reported on the role of stem cells in 
regenerative medicine, it is crucial that researchers continue to examine the roles 
and mechanisms of MSCs in wound healing to evaluate the therapeutic potential 
of MSCs and PRF.
