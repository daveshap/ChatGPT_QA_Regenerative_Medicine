Abstract 
Influenza A virus activates cellular inflammasome pathways, though it remains unknown 
whether many of the effector proteins downstream of inflammasome activation promote virus 
clearance or instead promote pathological inflammation. We investigated the role of gasdermin 
D (GSDMD), a pore-forming inflammasome effector protein that allows cellular release of 
inflammatory molecules and eventual pyroptotic lysis of cells. GSDMD knockout (KO) mice 
infected with influenza virus exhibited reduced weight loss and mortality compared to infected 
wild type (WT) mice. Lung viral titers were similar between genotypes, indicating that GSDMD 
does not directly affect virus replication. Instead, we observed that GSDMD KO mice had less 
severe lung inflammation, histopathology, and immune cell infiltration, suggesting that GSDMD 
promotes tissue-damaging immune responses following infection. Global transcriptomic analysis 
revealed significant decreases in specific inflammatory gene programs in GSDMD KO lungs, 
including decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and activation gene signatures, which were 
confirmed by decreased neutrophil elastase measurements and decreased neutrophil numbers 
in the lung. Indeed, exogenous depletion of neutrophils starting at day 3 post infection in WT 
mice recapitulated the protective phenotype observed in GSDMD KO mice, implicating 
neutrophils as central players in the GSDMD-dependent pathological response to influenza 
virus. Overall, these findings reveal an important role for GSDMD during influenza virus-induced 
lung inflammation, pathogenesis, and neutrophil accumulation. Therapeutic interventions 
targeting the GSDMD/neutrophil axis may provide an effective means to treat severe influenza 
virus infection.

Introduction 
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection remains a threat to global public health with seasonal 
epidemics affecting nearly 10% of the world’s population annually and emergent global 
pandemics remaining an ever-present threat 1,2. Exuberant inflammatory immune responses 
and excessive tissue damage often characterize severe IAV infections. Indeed, IAV is known to 
trigger multiple inflammatory pathways, including the activation of cellular inflammasomes 
through multiple mechanisms 3. However, whether inflammasome activation is beneficial or 
detrimental to the outcome of infection is a topic of debate 4-9. Further, roles for many of the 
specific effector proteins downstream of inflammasome activation remain unstudied during 
influenza virus infection. Here, we exaine the role of Gasdermin D (GSDMD), which is cleaved 
by inflammasome-activated caspases, allowing it to form cellular pores that release 
inflammatory products and induce pyroptotic cell death 10-13. 
Investigations of the NLRP3 inflammasome revealed that it can be a double-edged 
sword during influenza virus infection, driving both beneficial antiviral effects and pathological 
inflammation 3,6. Knockout of NLRP3 in mice results in accelerated death 5, but partial inhibition 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome was shown to be beneficial during influenza virus infection 6-8. 
Previous work from our lab has also shown that mice treated with an experimental therapeutic 
protein, recombinant human Mitsugumin 53 (MG53, also known as TRIM72), exhibited 
dramatically reduced morbidity following otherwise lethal influenza virus infection 14. MG53 
nucleates membrane repair processes and also has anti-inflammatory effects 15. Indeed, the 
decreased severity of disease in MG53-treated mice corresponded with significantly lower levels 
of NLRP3  and IL-1 in the lungs of IAV-infected mice 14. Interestingly, these treated mice also 
exhibited reduced levels of activated GSDMD, suggesting to us that excessive inflammasome 
activation, including GSDMD activity, contributes to pathological inflammation during influenza 
virus infection.  
GSDMD is a member of the pore-forming family of gasdermin proteins, many of which 
have characterized functions in cell death [8]. Processing of GSDMD involves cleavage of the 
N-terminal domain from its inhibitory C-terminal domain, allowing the freed N-terminal fragment 
to assemble into oligomers that stabilize as ring-shaped pores in the plasma membrane 13,16. 
Formation of these GSDMD pores allows the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-
1β and IL-18 17-19, which can promote leukocyte recruitment and viral clearance 20,21. Unresolved 
pore formation can lead to uncontrolled release of additional inflammatory cytosolic 
components, pyroptotic cell death, and tissue damage 12,21.

  GSDMD has also been associated with the regulation of neutrophil activity and 
recruitment to inflamed tissues 9,22. Of the numerous immune cell types important for control of 
influenza virus infection, neutrophils are among the first to infiltrate sites of infection 23. 
Beneficial functions of neutrophils include phagocytic activity, cytokine and chemokine release, 
and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are traditionally associated with 
antibacterial activities but also promote an antiviral state 24-28. Conversely, other studies have 
highlighted the potentially detrimental effect of unchecked neutrophil recruitment characterized 
by hyperinflammation and poor influenza virus-induced disease outcomes in mice, non-human 
primates, and humans 4,29-32. Collectively, these observations suggest that neutrophil dynamics 
may represent a critical determinant of influenza virus pathology. In the present study, we 
explored the role of GSDMD in IAV infections using GSDMD KO mice and discovered that loss 
of GSDMD decreases lung inflammation, lung neutrophil accumulation, and mortality during this 
viral infection. The observed decreases in inflammatory pathology did not affect virus loads or 
hinder recovery from infection, thus identifying GSDMD as an exciting potential target for 
decreasing severity of influenza virus infections.   
 
Materials and Methods 
THP-1 Cell culture – Vector control and and GSDMD KD THP-1 cells were generated by 
lentiviral shRNA-mediated targeting and were generously provided by Dr. Amal Amer at The 
Ohio State University. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher scientific) 
supplemented with 10% EquaFETAL bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals). All cells were cultured in 
a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were additionally treated with 25 nM phorbol 
myristate acetate (PMA) for 3 days as previously described 33 to allow for differentiation into 
macrophages. 
 
Virus stocks and in vitro infection – Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8, provided 
by Dr. Thomas Moran of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai) was propagated in 
embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) and titered as described previously 34. 
Infection of THP-1 cells with PR8 was done at an MOI of 10 for 48hrs.  
 
Mouse studies – WT and GSDMD KO mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice 
were infected intranasally under anesthesia with isoflurane according to protocols approved by 
the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse infections were 
performed with a dose of 50 TCID50 of PR8. For neutrophil depletion experiments, WT mice

IgG2a isotype control, anti-trinitrophenol antibody (InVivoMAb, BE0089) via intraperitoneal 
injection on day 3 post infection. From days 4 through 8 post infection, mice were injected with 
0.2 mg of the same antibodies. For determining lung titers and cytokine levels, tissues were 
collected and homogenized in 1ml of PBS, flash-frozen, and stored at −80°C prior to titering on 
MDCK cells or analysis via ELISA. TCID50 values were calculated using the Reed-Muench 
method.  
 
Western blotting – For detection of protein expression in lung tissue, samples were lysed in a 
1% SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50mM triethanolamine pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl) containing a cocktail of 
phosphatase protease inhibitors (Sigma, 4906845001) and protease inhibitors (Thermo 
Scientific, A32965). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and soluble protein 
supernatents were used for Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein (30ug) were 
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto membranes. Membranes were blocked with 10% 
non-fat milk in Phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and probed with 
antibodies against GSDMD (abcam, ab219800) and actin (abcam, ab3280). For Western 
blotting of THP-1 cells, samples were lysed in 1% SDS containing protease inhibitors prior to 
SDS-PAGE separation as described above. Membranes were probed with antibodies against 
influenza virus nucleoprotein (abcam, ab20343), GSDMD (abcam, ab210070), and GAPDH 
(Thermo Scientific, ZG003).  
 
Single and multiplex ELISAs – human IL-1β, IL-6, CCL1, and TNF, and  mouse IFNβ and CCL1 
ELISAs were performed on supernatent from lung homogenates or cell culture supernatants 
using the respective R&D Systems Duoset ELISA kits (catalogue # DY201, DY206, DY8234, 
DY272, and DY845) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β 
levels were also assayed via multiplex ELISA (Mesoscale Diagnostics, mouse V-plex pro-
inflammatory panel 1, K15048D) performed by the OSUMC Center for Clinical Research 
Management core facility. 
  
Flow cytometry – On day 7 post influenza virus infection, mice were euthanized and lungs were 
homogenized in GentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi) containing Dnase I (Sigma Aldrich) and type IV 
collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Lungs were processed into single cell 
suspensions using GentleMACS equipment. Single cell homogenates were blocked in CellBlox 
(Invitrogen) and viability stain was performed using eFluor 780 Fixable Viability Dye (Invitrogen)

antibodies for CD45, Ly6G and Ly6C (catalogue number M001T02R02, 46-9668-82, and 48-
5932-82, respectively) for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were fixed with BD FACS lysis buffer for 10 
minutes at 4°C, resuspended in PBS, and run on a Cytek Aurora instrument. Count beads 
(Invitrogen) were added to each sample for quantification of total cell number. Samples were 
analyzed using FlowJo Software (10.8.1).  
 
Histology – For lung histology (H&E and anti-CD45 staining), lung tissue samples were fixed in 
10% neutral-buffered formalin at 4°C for 24 hours and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Lungs 
were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained, and imaged by Histowiz (Histowiz.com, 
Brooklyn, NY, USA). Unbiased electronic quantification of resultant images was performed 
using ImageJ software and the color deconvolution method as described previously 9,35-37.  
 
RNA sequencing and Functional Enrichment Analysis – RNA was extracted from lung tissue 
using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA library preparation and sequencing was performed by GENEWIZ 
(GENEWIZ LLC./Azenta US, Inc South Plainfield, NJ, USA) with the following methods, as 
provided by GENEWIZ:  “The RNA samples received were quantified using Qubit 2.0 
Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA integrity was checked 
using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The RNA sequencing libraries 
were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina using 
manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Briefly, mRNAs were 
initially enriched with Oligod(T) beads. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 15 minutes at 94 
°C. First strand and second strand cDNA were subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments 
were end repaired and adenylated at 3’ends, and universal adapters were ligated to cDNA 
fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment by PCR with limited cycles. The 
sequencing libraries were validated on the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, 
CA, USA), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA) as well as by quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The 
sequencing libraries were multiplexed and clustered onto a flowcell. After clustering, the flowcell 
was loaded onto the Illumina HiSeq instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. The 
samples were sequenced using a 2x150bp Paired End (PE) configuration. Image analysis and 
base calling were conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS). Raw sequence data (.bcl 
files) generated from Illumina HiSeq was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using 
Illumina bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mis-match was allowed for index sequence identification.”

Raw fastq files were processed, aligned and quantified with a HyperScale architecture 
developed by ROSALIND (ROSALIND, Inc. San Diego, CA, https://rosalind.bio/). Read 
Distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heatmaps, and sample MDS plots were generated 
as part of the quality control step. Statistical analysis for differential gene expression was 
performed using the “limma” R library 38. The principal component analysis and volcano plots 
were formatted in PRISM software using numerical values provided by ROSALIND. Heatmaps 
were generated from gene expression values provided by ROSALIND using Morpheus 
software. The topGO R library was used to determine local similarities and dependencies 
between GO terms in order to perform Elim pruning correction. Additional analysis was 
performed using the REACTOME database 39, PanglaoDB 40, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(Qiagen).  
 
Results 
GSDMD potentiates inflammatory responses and morbidity during severe influenza virus 
infection in mice 
To investigate the roles of GSDMD during influenza virus infection, we infected wild type 
(WT) and GSDMD KO mice with influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (referred to 
hereafter as PR8). We first examined lungs for total GSDMD levels, as well as cleaved GSDMD 
N-terminal fragment indicative of activation, at day 7 post infection via western blotting. Cleaved 
GSDMD was detected in the lungs of infected WT mice as expected 14, whereas only full-length 
GSDMD could be seen in lungs from mock-infected WT mice (Fig 1A). GSDMD could not be 
detected in lungs from infected GSDMD KO mice, confirming the expected lack of GSDMD 
protein in these animals (Fig 1A). GSDMD KO mice also lost significantly less weight than their 
WT counterparts starting on day 5 post infection and continuing through day 7 (Fig 1B). The 
observed weight loss difference may actually underestimate the protective effects of GSDMD 
deficiency because WT mice had significantly higher mortality rates throughout infection; thus, 
the sickest animals were removed from the study as they succumbed to infection, skewing the 
subsequent weight averages. Indeed, over 60% of WT mice succumbed to infection, compared 
to roughly 10% of GSDMD KO animals, demonstrating a profound protective effect of the loss of 
GSDMD (Fig 1C).   
Additional mice were sacrificed on day 7 post infection for analysis of viral titers and 
inflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs. Virus titers in the lungs of WT and KO mice were 
similar (Fig 1D), indicating that GSDMD increases the severity of influenza virus infection 
without directly affecting virus replication. Indeed, GSDMD KO mice on average had decreased

levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFNβ, with levels of TNFα showing a 
statistically significant decrease compared to WT mice (Fig 1E). Interestingly, levels of IL-1β 
varied widely between animals and did not correlate with animal genotype despite the 
established role of GSDMD in facilitating release of IL-1β 17-19 (Fig 1E). This is consistent with 
our previous findings in which GSDMD was required for maximal levels of IL-1β in the lung early 
in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but was dispensible later in infection 9. We also observed that the 
chemokine CCL1 was significantly decreased in GSDMD KO lungs compared to WT, consistent 
with the reported role for GSDMD in immune cell chemotaxis 41,42 (Fig 1E).   
To determine whether human GSDMD functions similarly to its mouse counterpart in 
promoting cytokine and chemokine secretion during influenza virus infection, we infected WT 
and GSDMD knockdown (KD) human THP1 macrophages and measured viral protein and 
cytokine levels after 48 hours. Consistent with known functions of GSDMD and our in vivo 
results, we saw a large decrease in IL-1β, IL-6, IFNβ and CCL1 levels secreted by GSDMD KD 
macrophages despite comparable levels of infection as indicated by detection of by viral 
nucleoprotein expression by Western blotting (Supplemental Figure 1A-C). Collectively, our 
results demonstrate that loss of GSDMD protects against severe influenza virus-induced illness 
without affecting lung virus loads. Likewise, GSDMD broadly promotes release of inflammatory 
mediators in both mouse and human cells during influenza virus infections. 
 
GSDMD facilitates immune cell recruitment to the lungs during IAV infection 
Given our results indicating decreased cytokine and chemokine secretion in GSDMD KO 
lungs, we hypothesized that lack of GSDMD leads to decreased inflammatory pathology 
following influenza virus infection. Thus, we examined gross lung pathology via hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) staining of lung sections at day 7 post infection. Although all infected lung sections 
showed areas of cell infiltration and consolidation, WT lungs had more severe pathology with 
immensely thickened alveolar septa, extensive macrophage, neutrophil, and lymphocyte 
accumulation, and less open airspace (Fig 2A). Areas of cellular consolidation versus open 
airspace were quantified to determine relative lung cellularity as a measure of pathology in 
individual mice 9,36. GSDMD KO mice showed decreased lung pathology via this unbiased 
quantification method as compared to WT mice (Fig 2B).  
  We next stained for the hematopoietic immune cell marker CD45 in lung sections to 
assess whether the decreased cellularity/consolidation that we observed in GSDMD KO versus 
WT lungs was due to dampened immune cell infiltration. We observed that infected GSDMD KO 
mouse lungs contained fewer CD45+ immune cells throughout their lung sections when

compared to infected WT lungs (Fig 3A). Notably, immune cells were often clustered around the 
peribronchole and perivascular spaces in WT mice compared to more diffuse immune cell 
staining through the lung tissue of GSDMD KO mice. Quantification of CD45 staining of lung 
sections from individual mice confirmed a significant decrease in CD45+ cells in GSDMD KO 
relative to WT lungs (Fig 3B). These results indicate that loss of GSDMD decreases immune 
cell recruitment to the lung and limits immune-mediated pathology during influenza virus 
infection, consistent with our observed protection of GSDMD KO mice from influenza virus-
induced morbidity and mortality. 
 
GSDMD KO mice have altered transcriptional responses following influenza virus 
infection 
To further understand the underlying mechanisms contributing to differences in survival 
and lung damage between WT and GSDMD KO animals, we compared global gene 
transcriptional responses of WT and GSDMD KO mice following influenza virus infection. 
Quantitative measurement of total mRNA expression from infected lungs at day 7 post infection 
showed distinct gene expression programs elicited between WT and GSDMD KO animals as as 
revealed by principal components analysis (Fig 4A). Statistical analysis of differential gene 
expression (fold change |3|, p-adj < 0.01) captured 812 genes that were increased in infected 
WT mice compared to infected GSDMD KO mice, while expression of 447 genes was increased 
in KOs, for a total of 1259 differentially expressed genes (Fig 4B,C). Gene set enrichment 
analysis reproducibly identified significant changes in antiviral immune responses between WT 
and GSDMD KO mice (Fig 4D). Notably, pathways associated with inflammatory defense 
responses to virus infection were decreased in GSDMD KO lungs. This gene set included 
interferons (IFNs), IFN-stimulated chemokines, and classical antiviral IFN-stimulated genes 
such as MX and OAS family genes (Fig 4E). These results are in accord with reports that the 
canonical GSDMD-dependent cytokine IL-1β can amplify the IFN response via induction of IRF1 
43,44, which was also decreased in GSDMD KO mice (Fig 4E). In agreement with our ELISA data 
(Fig 1E), our RNAseq analyses revealed an attenuation of inflammatory cytokine and 
chemokine gene programs in GSDMD KO lungs in general, with CCL1, a chemokine secreted 
by activated monocytes, macrophages, and T cells, being the most significantly downregulated 
gene identified (Fig 4D). Together with our viral titer and ELISA measurements, these gene 
expression data collectively suggest that dampened inflammatory responses in the absence of 
GSDMD underly the decreased lung pathology and increased survival of GSDMD KO mice 
following influenza virus infection.

Loss of GSDMD results in decreased neutrophil recruitment to lungs during influenza 
virus infection 
In addition to changes in cytokines and chemokines, functional enrichment analysis of 
differentially expressed genes that intersect with immune cell specific gene expression 
(PanglaoDB) suggested significant decreases in myeloid cells in GSDMD KO lungs (Fig 5A). 
This was consistent with observed enrichment of biological pathways involved in granulocytic 
neutrophil function (Fig 4D). This included changes in genes associated with neutrophil 
degranulation (Fig 5B) as well as decreases in genes for chemokines that recruit neutrophils, 
chemokine receptors expressed on neutrophils, and other molecules associated with neutrophil 
function (Fig 5C). Thus, we examined whether GSDMD was involved in neutrophil recruitment 
to the lungs during influenza virus infection. We found that infected WT mice exhibited robust 
neutrophil recruitment to the lungs at day 7 post infection (Fig 5D), while there was no 
observable increase in neutrophil infiltration in GSDMD KO mice (Fig 5E). This was consistent 
with a decrease in the levels of neutrophil elastase (ELA2), an indicator of activated neutrophils 
and clinical marker of disease severity 45, in GSDMD KO as compared to WT lungs (Fig 5F). 
These results suggest that GSDMD expression is required for the full recruitment of neutrophils 
to the lung during influenza virus infection.   
  To probe whether decreased neutrophil infiltration could explain the decrease in 
influenza virus infection severity that we observed in the GSDMD KO animals, we depleted 
neutrophils early in infection of WT mice and measured infection outcomes.  Briefly, we treated 
mice antibodies targeting neutrophils (α-Ly6G) or isotype control antibody, starting at day 3 post 
infection through day 8 post infection (Fig 6A). This treatment timeline was chosen to allow 
acute neutrophil responses to proceed uninhibited prior to blockade of a presumptive excessive, 
pathological response. We confirmed that antibody-mediated depletion led to a marked 
decrease in total neutrophil numbers, as well as relative percentage of neutrophils compared to 
the entire immune cell population, in the lungs of α-Ly6G treated mice at day 5 post infection 
(Fig 6B). The specifity of neutrophil depletion was further confirmed by analyzing total counts 
and percentages of eosinophils and alveolar macrophages compared to all CD45+ immune 
cells, which were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. (Fig 6B). When 
examining morbidity between the cohorts of mice, the α-Ly6G treated mice experienced 
significantly less influenza virus-induced weight loss than the isotype control treated group (Fig 
6C). Remarkably, neutrophil depletion was completely protective against lethal infection,

whereas we observed 60% lethality in isotype control-treated mice (Fig 6D), a result that 
mirrored the protective effects seen in GSDMD KO mice. 
  Also similar to results comparing GSDMD KO and WT mice mice, viral titers in the lungs 
of neutrophil-depleted and control treated mice were not statistically different from one another 
at either day 5 or day 7 post infection (Fig 6E). We further observed that levels of several 
inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IFNβ and TNF-α, were significantly decreased in 
the lungs of neutrophil-depleted mice at day 5 post infection (Fig 6F). Likewise, CCL1 levels 
were commensurately decreased following α-Ly6G treatment, suggesting that neutrophils may 
potentiate a postive-feedback loop of immune cell chemotaxis (Fig 6F). Finally, we quantified 
neutrophil elastase in the lungs of -Ly6G treated and isotype control treated mice to further 
confirm that neutrophil elastase serves as a marker of neutrophil presence and activity. Indeed, 
we saw decreased neutrophil elastase in the lungs of -Ly6G treated mice, reinforcing our data 
showing a similar change in GSDMD KO mice with less neutrophil presence (Fig 5F). In sum, 
our results presented here demonstrate that neutrophil recruitment to the lungs during influenza 
virus infection is largely dependent on GSDMD and that neutrophils contribute to a pathological 
inflammatory response and influenza mortality. 
 
Discussion 
  Our results have identified a detrimental role for GSDMD during influenza virus infection. 
We found that in the absence of GSDMD, mice experienced reduced morbidity and mortality 
despite viral burden in the lungs being unaffected (Fig 1). Without contributing to the control of 
virus titers, we found that GSDMD profoundly contributed to lung inflammation, immune cell 
recruitment, and histopathology (Fig 1-3). The improved outcome of GSDMD KO mice following 
influenza virus infection compared to WT mice corresponded to global transcriptional decreases 
in a multitude of tissue-damaging inflammatory pathways (Fig 4). Additionally, impaired 
neutrophil chemotaxis and activity gene expression programs in the absence of GSDMD 
correlated with improved disease outcome, which we subsequently substantiated via exogenous 
depletion of these immune cells (Fig 5,6). These results suggest that overabundant neutrophils 
drive disease severity in the context of influenza virus infection. Indeed, our data add to a 
growing number of studies suggesting  excessive neutrophil recruitment correlates with poor 
disease outcomes 29-31.  
Importantly, GSDMD was also required for maximal pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion 
by human macrophages infected with influenza virus, suggesting that human GSDMD likely also 
drives inflammation in human influenza virus infections (Supplemental Figure 1). This paralells

recent data showing GSDMD co-localization with pyroptotic macrophages in the lungs of 
severely infected macaques, which also had widespread expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines 4. In addition to providing an important paralles between murine, non-human primate, 
and human GSDMD, these data suggest that GSDMD also regulates cytokine 
production/secretion in macrophages, which are known targets of influenza virus infections 46,47. 
Influenza virus infection is among the most common causes of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) in adults 48. Development of ARDS is marked by bilateral edema and 
worsened oxygen delivery 49, and a major contributor to these criteria is the unchecked 
inflammation caused by cellular immune responses activated to control replicating virus. 
Specifically, neutrophil infiltration and abundance is correlated with the severity of ARDS 50, and 
neutrophil secretion of tissue damaging enzymes and inflammatory extracellular traps can 
exacerbate progression of ARDS 48. Likewise, GSDMD-mediated NETosis was recently 
identified as a driver of disease progression in an LPS-induced model of ARDS 51. Given that 
GSDMD is a broad promoter of inflammation in response to infection and that there are 
numerous infectious causes of ARDS, our results suggest that GSDMD may be a potential 
therapeutic target for mitigating ARDS progression in the context of respiratory infections. 
While GSDMD is the final effector protein in the pyroptosis pathway, the possibility 
remains that other intermediate proteins are contributing to the outcome of influenza virus 
infection. Multiple caspases have been implicated in both positively and negatively regulating 
infection. Caspase-1 has been shown to exacerbate acute illness but also promote adaptive 
immunity to influenza virus 52,53, whereas caspase-3 activation during the onset of apoptosis 
may be crucial for immune antagonism and efficient influenza virus propagation 54,55. Interplay of 
these proteins, and whether the overlapping pathways they affect are synergistic or 
compensatory, remains to be determined. 
Our unexpected results indicating that IL-1β levels are unaffected by the absence of 
GSDMD, despite its canonical role in IL-1β release 17-19, suggest that there there are redundant 
mechanisms for pyroptotic cytokine release during influenza virus infection, at least at late 
timepoints following infection. Indeed, these results are in accord with our published findings 
that IL-1β levels in the lung at day 2 post infection with SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on 
GSDMD, but that IL-1β release occurs in a GSDMD-independent manner at later times post 
infection [18]. Interestingly, we found that loss of GSDMD was not beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 
infection 9, highlighting intriguing differences in the pathological mechanisms activated by 
SARS-CoV-2 versus influenza virus that warrant further study. Excitingly, we observed a 
previously unreported effect of GSDMD in promoting IFNβ expression and production (Fig 1, 4,

S1), further suggesting that GSDMD potentiates pro-inflammatory responses beyond release of 
canonical inflammasome molecules. Interestingly, attenuation of a number of pro-inflammatory 
cytokine responses, including IFNβ, in GSDMD KO mice had no appreciable effect on virus 
replication. However, it is well established that the pathological, tissue-damaging effects of IFNs 
continue to accumulate beyond the point at which their antiviral effects peak 56-58. These data 
suggest that GSDMD KO mice mount a blunted, but sufficient, pro-inflammatory response to 
combat virus replication without developing the severe morbidity associated with cytokine storm. 
Overall, we discovered that GSDMD promotes inflammatory lung pathology during 
influenza virus infection. Importantly, GSDMD is dispensible for virus control, but exacerbates 
severe illness, thus identifying it as a promising candidate for host-directed therapeutic targeting 
during influenza virus infection.
