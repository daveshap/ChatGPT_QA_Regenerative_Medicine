Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK MG) is an 
autoimmune disease that causes life-threatening muscle weakness 
due to anti-MuSK autoantibodies that disrupt neuromuscular junction 
signaling. To avoid chronic immunosuppression from current therapies, we 
engineered T cells to express a MuSK chimeric autoantibody receptor with 
CD137-CD3ζ signaling domains (MuSK-CAART) for precision targeting of 
B cells expressing anti-MuSK autoantibodies. MuSK-CAART demonstrated 
similar efficacy as anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells for depletion 
of anti-MuSK B cells and retained cytolytic activity in the presence of soluble 
anti-MuSK antibodies. In an experimental autoimmune MG mouse model, 
MuSK-CAART reduced anti-MuSK IgG without decreasing B cells or total 
IgG levels, reflecting MuSK-specific B cell depletion. Specific off-target 
interactions of MuSK-CAART were not identified in vivo, in primary human 
cell screens or by high-throughput human membrane proteome array. 
These data contributed to an investigational new drug application and 
phase 1 clinical study design for MuSK-CAART for the treatment of MuSK 
autoantibody-positive MG.
