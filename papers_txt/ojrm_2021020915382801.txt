1. Introduction 
Heart muscle degeneration is a leading cause of debilitation and death in hu-
mans. Its primary cause is partial or complete obliteration of the coronary artery, 
often precipitating acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Long-term ischemia leads 
to ventricular cell death and myocardial necrosis. Although medication, trans- 
myocardial revascularization (TMR), and CABG can increase local blood supply 
and reduce short-term mortality and morbidity, most patients continue suffer-
ing decreased ventricular function and chronic heart failure. 
Severe myocardial infarction conveys serious complications such as ventricu-
lar aneurysm, wall thinning and rupture with fatal consequences. Traditional 
aneurysm resection improves heart contractility by restoring the original oval 
structure of the left ventricle. This procedure is reserved only for patients with at 
least medium-sized ventricles because of volume consideration. Prognosis for 
these severe heart failure patients is three to six months of life despite CABG. 
Heart transplantation has been the gold standard for patients with end-stage 
heart failure, but donor heart non-availability and lifelong immunosuppression 
dictate its limited usage. It is urgent to explore new therapeutic measures to in-
crease the quality of life and lifespan of these patients. 
Chronic ischemia after AMI causes loss of cardiomyocytes, contractile fila-
ments and ventricular contractility. Regeneration attempt by surviving cardi-
omyocytes consists of undergoing at most four mitotic divisions because the te-
lomeric DNA repeats [1] in these terminally differentiated cells are minimal. 
Such attempt cannot regenerate enough cardiomyocytes to produce the neces-
sary quantity of contractile filaments such as myosin, actin, troponin and tro-
pomyosin to sustain normal heart contractility. The degenerative heart also 
transmits biochemical signals to recruit stem cells from the stroma and from the 
bone marrow to repair the muscle damage. Due to the significant increase in fi-
broblast growth factor release after infarction, much of the recruited stem cells 
differentiate to become fibroblasts instead of cardiomyocytes, forming scars and 
not contractile filaments. 
The damaged myocardium needs replenishment of live, genetically normal, 
myogenic cells to deposit contractile filaments to regain heart function, prefera-
bly before fibroblast infiltration. This is when AMT has an advantage over all 
other cell types [2] [3]. Considering dystrophic and diabetic cardiomyopathies as 
hereditary, and ischemic cardiomyopathy as genetically predisposed, AMT was

designed to genetically repair hereditary degenerative cells and to replenish de-
generated cells with live ones. In 1990, AMT was, and still is, the world’s first 
human gene therapy and the world’s first somatic cell therapy in the treatment 
of human muscle genetic disease [4]. 
Myoblasts are differentiated cells destined to become muscles. Unlike cardi-
omyocytes, myoblasts possess long telomere DNA subunits and can undergo 50 
mitotic divisions without loss of myogenic capacity [2] [3] or developing into 
tumor [5]. The transition from animal experimentation [6] [7] into cardiac clin-
ical trials was largely based on previous demonstration of significant safety and 
efficacy in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in FDA approved 
Phase II and Phase III clinical trials using allogeneic myoblast allografts [8] [9] 
[10]. 
Law et al. reported in the year 2000 the pioneering study of implanting human 
myoblasts into the porcine hearts with endovascular catheter of the NOGA sys-
tem [11]. The mechanisms by which allogeneic human myoblasts survived, de-
veloped and functioned with the use of cyclosporine immunosuppression were 
examined through open chest endomyocardial injections of cultured skeletal 
myoblasts into infarcted porcine myocardium. Three mechanisms were eluci-
dated as proof-of-concept using genetic markers to label the nuclei of the donor 
myoblasts. Under the influence of hormones and slow contractile activity of the 
heart, donor myoblasts fused among themselves to form new cardiomyocytes, 
depositing contractile filaments to improve heart contractility. Others fused with 
the host cardiomyocytes through natural cell fusion, spontaneously transferring 
their nuclei into host cardiomyocytes to impart myogenic regeneration. Still 
others fused to form myotubes that eventually developed into immature skeletal 
myofibers containing satellite cells. New production of contractile filaments 
augmented heart contractility [2] [3] [12]. 
In 2004, Law et al. reported the world’s first two cases of allogeneic myoblast 
transplantation for myocardial infarction [3] [12]. Results demonstrated that the 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), viability, motility, myocardial perfu-
sion, and ventricular wall thickness were significantly improved [3] [12]. The 
end-diastolic and end-systolic blood volumes were increased without significant 
arrhythmia. At 12 months after implantation, LVEF was increased by about 
40%, and perfusion capacity increased by 38% [3] [12]. More than 300 cases of 
autologous myoblast transplantation internationally have shown that it was safe 
and efficacious in treating ischemic cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Ap-
proximately 200 cases were injected after thoracotomy and 100 cases were in-
jected with endovascular catheters [10] [12]. Further advance with myoblast 
clinical trials has been distracted for 17 years by Piero Anversa’s misconduct in 
cardiac stem cell research in Harvard University until 10/14/2018.

pital of Xinxiang Medical College to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy in-
formation to justify future clinical trials of AMT. This study was registered in 
the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry numbered ChiCTR2000039590. All subjects 
signed Informed Consents for the trial. 
2.2. Case Selection 
A total of 10 heart failure subjects suffering severe myocardial infarction with 
ventricular aneurysm in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department of the Third 
Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College from February 2016 to March 
2018 were selected. Subject profiles are shown in Table S1. Tables S1-S8 are 
placed in Supplementary Appendix. 
2.3. Research Methods 
Clinical evaluation was performed using a self-contrast method. 
All patients were given CABG and conventional medication for symptomatic 
control of blood pressure, blood lipid, blood glucose, anticoagulation, coronary 
expansion, cardiac strengthening, and diuretics. Traditional aneurysm resection 
was not used in this study. 
2.4. Manufacture of Allogeneic Human Myoblasts 
Donors: Upon approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Cell 
Therapy Institute and the signing of the Donor Informed Consents, muscle do-
nors were admitted after meeting the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. They 
were male volunteers between the ages of 16 and 36. They were certified by a 
physician as being in good health, having normal levels of aspartate aminotrans-
ferase  (AST),  alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LD)  and 
tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis (RPR), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). 
They also received the following tests: Chem 24, CBC, and physical examination 
with normal results. Donors were excluded if they had any chronic or infectious 
diseases, and if were allergic to the local anesthetic Lidocaine. 
Muscle Biopsy: About 2 grams of muscle were removed from the quadriceps 
muscle using an open biopsy technique under local anesthetic (Lidocaine patch) 
in a sterile field of a surgical suite of a hospital. The donor site was sutured and 
bandaged. No prophylactic antibiotic was used. The donor was discharged after 
recovery from the surgical procedure to be followed by his physician if infection 
occurred. 
Preparation of Myoblasts: Biopsy specimen obtained was processed imme-
diately  using  sterile  techniques  meeting  CFDA  approved  GMP  standards. 
Myoblasts were cultured in growth medium and incubated at 37˚C and in 7% 
CO as previously described [13] [14]. Myoblasts were frozen at different stages 
2
so the time allotted for culturing could be coordinated with a scheduled trans-
plant. The number of frozen cells and the number of samples were documented.

One test vial was reserved in liquid nitrogen for each biopsy. Random samples of 
the myoblasts were tested for their abilitytodivide, fuse, and formmyotubes [13]. 
Lotreleasetesting consisted of sterility, endotoxin, mycoplasma, and testing for 
myoblast identity, purity, potency, viability, and cell count on a pooled sample 
prior to transplant meeting quality control standards [13] [14] [15]. A retain 
sample of myoblasts was reserved from each transplant. 
2.5. Immunosuppression 
Each subject took daily oral doses of 5 mg/kg body weight of cyclosporine for 
three weeks with weaning using half doses after the second week to suppress re-
jection of the allografts. Since myoblast fusion completed within one week after 
transplantation [8] [16], and since myotubes and mature myofibers did not ex-
press major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1) surface antigens [8] it 
was not necessary to administer lifelong immunosuppression as in heart trans-
plants [10]. 
2.6. Myoblast Transplantation 
Following distal anastomosis of the coronary artery bypass surgery, transplanta-
tion of myoblasts was performed on the third day of cyclosporine administra-
tion. Approximately 1 billion myoblasts (at 108 cells /mL) were injected with 20 
injections placed 1 cm apart along the inside border of the infarction. For each 
injection, about 50 million myoblasts were carefully deposited in a centripetal 
diagonal track (<5 mm) as the needle was slowly withdrawn out of the inner 
border of the infracted myocardium. 
2.7. Safety Indicators 
Blood routine (including white blood cell count, neutrophil fraction, red blood 
cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count), liver and kidney functions (including 
albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, glutamate aminotransferase, 
urea nitrogen, creatinine), electrolytes, bleeding and clotting times were deter-
mined before, and at 6 months and at 2 years after AMT. 
Intraoperative and postoperative adverse reactions including virus infection, 
malignant arrhythmia, and death events were carefully monitored. 
2.8. Efficacy Indicators 
The clinical symptoms, vital signs, imaging examination and blood laboratory 
examination results of the patients before and after the operation were com-
pared, and the adverse reactions during and after the operation were observed. 
Observation Methods 
1) Subjective symptoms (such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, number 
of angina pectoris, sit-up breathing at night, urine output, appetite, 6-minute 
walk test) before and after the operation were continuously observed.

2) Postoperative ECG monitoring 
After treatment, all subjects underwent multifunctional 48-hour-holter moni-
toring to determine if there were changes in ECG and vital signs. An electrocar-
diogram was performed again at 6 months and at 2 years postoperatively to ob-
serve if there was occurrence of arrhythmia. 
3) Echocardiography and cardiac ECT 
Patients underwent Echo and ECT examinations before, at 6 months and at 2 
years postoperatively to determine the LVEF, cardiac output (CO), and left ven-
tricular end diastolic dimension (LVDd). 
2.9. Statistical Analyses 
Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS19.0 
software. P < 0.05 indicated significant statistical differences. 
3. Results 
The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses 
and the reporting of adverse events and for the fidelity of the study to the proto-
col. 
3.1. Safety Assessment 
Adverse Reaction Assessment 
All ten subjects successfully underwent treatment without malignant arrhyth-
mia, chills, fever, allergic reactions, vomiting, viral infection or other adverse 
reactions. 
Throughout the course of the entire study, two subjects exhibited early post- 
operative occasional ventricular premature beats. Another two subjects demon-
strated atrial premature beats. Considered related to electrolyte disorders and 
myocardial damage of the primary disease, they were converted to sinus after 
symptomatic treatment. No malignant arrhythmia and no deaths occurred, and 
there was no virus infection after treatment. 
There were no statistically significant differences between the means (±SD) in 
the leukocyte count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and 
platelet count before versus at 6 months, and at 2 years after treatment (P > 0.05) 
(Table S2 in Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no statistically significant difference between the mean levels (±SD) 
of total bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate amino trans-
ferase before versus at 6 months, and at 2 years after treatment (P > 0.05) (Table 
S3 in Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no statistically significant difference between the mean levels (±SD) 
of serum creatinine or urea nitrogen before versus at 6 months, and at 2 years 
after treatment (P > 0.05) (Table S4) in Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no statistically significant difference in the mean levels (±SD) of 
serum K+, Na+, Cl−, and Ca2+ before treatment versus at 6 months and at 2 years

after treatment (P > 0.05) (Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no statistically significant difference in the mean levels (±SD) of 
prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and partial prothrombin time before versus after 
treatment (P > 0.05) (Table S6 in Supplementary Appendix). 
3.2. Efficacy Assessment 
3.2.1. Objective Evaluation 
Cardiac ECT demonstrated significant improvement in myocardial perfusion 
and in viability of ventricular myocardium at 6 months and at 2 years after sur-
gery (Figure 1). The mean LVEFs were increased by 20.1% at 6 months after 
treatment, and by 19.3% at 2 years after treatment as compared to the control 
mean before treatment. These mean increases were of statistical significance at 
P < 0.05 (Table S7, Figure 1, Figure 2(A)). 
There was no significant difference (Table S7 in Supplementary Appendix) in 
the mean levels (±SD) of LVDd (Figure 2(B)) and CO (Figure 2(C)) before 
versus after treatment (P > 0.05). Although the mean difference in CO before 
versus after treatment was of statistical insignificance, the postoperative means 
were all higher than before treatment. Consistently, the mean postoperative 
lengths of LVDd were lower than that before treatment. 
MR imaging showed no significant difference in the mean levels (±SD) of 
ventricular aneurysm area and wall thickness before versus after treatment (P > 
0.05) (Table S8 in Supplementary Appendix) though individual variations did 
demonstrate significant increases in wall thickness (Figure 3). 
3.2.2. Subjective Evaluation 
Postoperative clinical improvement included significantly fewer episodes of

increased steadily. 
The results depicted essentially derived from allogeneic myoblast culture and 
transplantation (Figure 4), in addition to CABG and cyclosporine immunosup-
pression. 
4. Discussion 
For the first time, AMT in adjunct use with CABG and cyclosporine, was dem-
onstrated to be safe and efficacious in sustaining the lifespan of end-stage heart 
failure patients, who suffered myocardial infarction with ventricular aneurysm, 
for up to 2 years, with significant improvement in LVEF (Table S7, Figure 1, 
Figure 2(A)), NYHA cardiac function (Central Illustration 1, Figure 5) and 
quality of life. It was the original design to define a treatment modality that 
could 100% sustain the survival of the severe heart failure patients having no 
more than 6-months of life expectance, and such design was demonstrated to be 
successful. The statistically significant increases in the mean LVEF by 20.1% at 6 
months after treatment, and by 19.3% at 2 years after treatment compared

favorably to those reported by all other studies using autologous myoblasts 17 - 
33. As the trend of improvement indicated, statistically significant difference in 
LVDd and CO before versus after treatment would have become apparent if 
more subjects were enrolled. 
The ultimate demonstration of AMT efficacy by itself should be from rando-
mized,  double-blinded  studies  involving  more  subjects  of  dystrophic  cardi-
omyopathies, diabetic cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathies that would 
not necessitate CABG. 
This study showed that white blood cell count, neutrophil count, total biliru-
bin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total red blood cells,

time, and partial prothrombin time before versus after treatment of myoblasts 
were not different (P > 0.05). On repeated follow-ups after the operation, there 
were no deaths, malignant arrhythmias, or viral infections. The results demon-
strated that allogeneic myoblast transplantation had no significant impact on 
various important indicators of the human body, and there was no serious ad-
verse reaction. Although occasional ventricular premature beats occurred in four 
subjects after CABG, all symptomatic treatments were traced to the sinus and 
were related to electrolyte disturbance, myocardial damage and the primary dis-
ease. None of the subjects experienced malignant arrhythmia or ventricular ta-
chycardia. 
AMT represented the earliest human cell therapy for heart disease [11]. 
Without significant knowledge of myoblast manufacture, quality control and cell 
transplant techniques, many clinicians rushed into clinical studies. Menasche, et 
al. first reported feasibility and safety data on ischemic heart failure patients, im-
planting 650 million to one billion autologous impure myoblast cells with overly 
large number of injections into the infarctions during CABG [17] [18]. Fol-
low-up studies showed that patients had significantly improved left ventricular 
function and NYHA function level, decreased ventricular remodeling, and in-
creased myocardial tolerance confirmed by histology. However, 4 patients had 
delayed episodes of sustained left ventricular tachycardia [18]. During this pe-
riod, similar reports continued to appear around the world with mixed results. 
In most of the reports, myoblast purity was determined using CD56+, an an-
tibody that reacts with fibroblasts, neurons, and myoblasts indiscriminately. A 
common pitfall of myoblast culture is fibroblast contamination. Since myoblast 
doubling time is about 21 hours and fibroblast doubling time is about 15 hours, 
fibroblast growth often overtakes the myoblast culture [13] [14]. Without pub-
lished documentation of quality controls, authors of these studies were implant-
ing very impure myoblasts. Fibroblasts produce scars but not contractile fila-
ments. These scars created numerous barriers to electric coupling and rhythmic 
synchronization of ventricular contraction. This pitfall, together with the physi-
cal trauma induced by overly large number of injections, were largely responsi-
ble for the malignant arrhythmia and tachycardia reported in some early pa-
tients, not to mention the gross GMP non-compliance in quality control of 
myoblast identity, viability, purity, quantity, potency, no mycoplasma, no endo-
toxins and no bacteria [19]-[33]. The latter explained cell death of up to 90% 
that affected the safety and efficacy of myoblast transplantation [34]. Clinical 
studies confirmed that CABG with transplantation of impure and non-viable 
myoblasts produced ventricular tachycardia [26]. The intercalated disc, the basic 
unit for the transmission and synchronization of electrical activity and mechan-
ical function between adjacent cardiac fibers were not found, and its absence 
constituted a risk of malignant arrhythmia after transplantation with substan-
dard myoblasts [35]. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of myoblast transplanta-
tion depend largely on high quality control of myoblast production and the 
technique of implantation.

Heartbeat is myogenic in origin and is initiated by pacemaker activity in the 
sinoatrial node. As depolarization sweeps through the atrioventricular node, the 
depolarization excites the Purkinje fibers of the bundle of His, which, in turn, 
signals the ventricles to contract rhythmically. Heart function would be impaired 
if the rhythmic action potentials do not synchronize the fiber contractions. In 
the regenerative heart with AMT, excitation of the newly formed and heteroka-
ryotic cardiomyocytes [2] [3] [12] remained unchanged because there was little 
change in gap junctions for current flow. However, where new skeletal myofiber 
[2] [3] [12] were formed, presumably at the inner border of the infarction, such 
heterogenicity might create aberrant electric activities such as arrhythmia, espe-
cially when earlier studies reported absence of gap junction protein connexin 43, a 
marker protein responsible for electrical coupling between cardiomyocytes [36]. 
Conceptually, myoblast transplantation should not cause arrhythmia if the 
well-researched standard operation procedures were followed. The thresholds of 
excitation for cardiac and skeletal myofibers are similar, i.e. between +40 mV to 
+50 mV depolarization. Whereas the cardiomyocyte action potential is triggered 
with an increase in Ca2+ conductance into the cell, the skeletal myofiber action 
potential is triggered with an increase of Na+ conductance. As Ca2+ has a greater 
ionic size than Na+ and thus lower ionic mobility, the action potential of cardi-
omyocytes has a longer duration (~250 ms) than that of skeletal myofiber (~1.5 
ms). This duration difference is advantageous because the same myocardial de-
polarization can simultaneously and synchronously stimulate the cardiac and 
skeletal myofibers through direct excitation contraction coupling. Since the ac-
tion potentials of skeletal myofibers are of short duration, they will merge into 
the longer compound action potential of the heart. The skeletal myofibers will 
cease to fire and stop contracting once Cl− efflux hyperpolarization of the myo-
cardium reaches approximately +40 mV. Since 90% of the transplanted myob-
lasts developed to become cardiomyocytes or heterokaryotic cardiomyocytes [2] 
[3] [12], and only a small amount of skeletal myofibers were formed, the elec-
trophysiologic treatise explains why none of the subjects in the current study 
experienced malignant arrhythmia from the myoblast transplantation. 
Abraham et al. [37] demonstrated in vitro that connexin 43 was expressed 
when exogenous connexin 43 gene was transferred into myoblasts. Electrophysi-
ological studies had also found that there was a synchronized instantaneous cal-
cium current between skeletal muscle myotubes and adjacent cardiomyocytes, 
further confirming that after transplantation, cardiomyocytes, heterokaryotic 
cardiomyocytes and skeletal myotubes were simultaneously activated through 
the same excitation-contraction coupling. Simultaneous contraction could not 
only promote the formation of gap junctions, but also effectively reduced the in-
cidence of arrhythmia. In addition, a sodium ionic current was detected [38], 
confirming that some myoblasts developed to become myotubes and immature 
myofiber [2] [3] [12]. Skeletal myofibers are known to adapt to the frequency of 
electric excitation to which they are subjected. Under the influence of hormones 
and slow contractile activity of the heart, these immature skeletal myofibers de-

veloped characteristics of cardiomyocytes. 
The regenerative heart with myoblasts was endowed with a greater number of 
myogenic cells capable of mitosis and was prepared to regenerate upon injury. 
These cells produced more contractile filaments to augment heart contractility. 
The latter is fundamental to the quality of life and the lifespan of patients suffer-
ing various forms of cardiovascular diseases. Being pluripotent, embryonic or 
adult stem cells exhibit uncontrolled differentiation into various lineages to 
produce bone, cartilage, fat, connective tissue, skeletal and heart muscles. Until 
scientists can accurately define the specific transcriptional factors and pathways 
to guide stem cell differentiation into adequate quantity of cardiomyocytes, the 
use of stem cell injection into the human heart would have a risk-benefit ratio 
much higher than the use of myoblasts. 
Myoblasts are differentiated cells destined to become muscles. Further studies 
are necessary to better define the efficacy of myoblast transplantation itself, pre-
ferably through transplanting male donor myoblasts into female subjects, and 
using the Y-chromosome to track the development of implanted allogeneic 
myoblasts in the host. Position papers in 2017 highlighted numerous developing 
cell therapies for severe heart failure with neither governmental approval nor 
endorsement [39] [40]. Heart transplant has remained the generally accepted 
treatment for end-stage patients. With an estimate of over 50 million heart fail-
ure patients worldwide, only a few thousand donor hearts were available for 
transplants last year. Patients who survive heart transplants need to be immu-
nosuppressed for life with not only compromised quality of life but also constant 
life-threat of COVID-19. 
5. Conclusion 
This study demonstrated survival and engraftment of allogeneic myoblasts in 
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The improvement of heart function and 
the quality of life of patients was the result of a combination of CABG and cell 
therapy. A large randomized clinical trial will be required to demonstrate the ef-
ficacy and safety of AMT. 
6. Perspectives 
6.1. Competency in Medical Knowledge 
AMT, cyclosporine immunosuppression and CABG were used to treat end-stage 
HF subjects without hope of obtaining a heart transplant. 
6.2. Competency in Patient Care 
AMT is much less invasive than a heart transplant. The regenerative heart with 
myoblast allograft is the patient’s very own and requires only 3 weeks of immu-
nosuppression. 
6.3. Translational Outlook 
At a small fraction of the cost of a heart transplant, the regenerative heart with
