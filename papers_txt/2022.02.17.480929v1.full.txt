Highlights 
•  The  transcriptome  and  differentiation  trajectory  of  enthesis  stem  cells  during  postnatal 
development are defined at single cell resolution. 
•  Transcription factor regulons drive enthesis stem cell differentiation. 
•  Gli1-lineage enthesis stem cells demonstrate in vivo and in vitro clonogenicity and multipotency. 
•  Transplantation of Gli1-lineage enthesis stem cells to enthesis injuries improves healing. 
Summary 
The enthesis, a fibrocartilaginous transition between tendon and bone, is necessary for the transfer of 
force from muscle to bone to produce joint motion. The enthesis is prone to injury due to mechanical 
demands, and it cannot regenerate. A better understanding of how the enthesis develops will lead to 
more effective therapies to prevent pathology and promote regeneration. Here, we used single-cell RNA 
sequencing to define the development transcriptome of the entheses over postnatal stages. Six resident 
cell types, including enthesis progenitors and mineralizing chondrocytes, were identified along with their 
transcription factor regulons and temporal regulation. Following our prior discovery of the necessity of 
Gli1-lineage cells for enthesis development and healing, we then examined their transcriptomes at single 
cell resolution and demonstrated their clonogenicity and multipotency. Transplantation of these Gli1-
lineage cells to enthesis injuries improved healing, demonstrating their therapeutic potential for enthesis 
regeneration.

Introduction 
Tendon connects to bone via a specialized interface known as the enthesis (Lu and Thomopoulos, 2013). 
Enthesis disorders, including rotator cuff disease, psoriatic arthritis, and spondyloarthritis, are prevalent 
and result in a heavy clinical burden (Derwin et al., 2018; Schett et al., 2017). The healthy enthesis is a 
functionally graded tissue that bridges unmineralized tendon and mineralized bone, and is formed and 
maintained by a spatially graded distribution of cell phenotypes (Genin et al., 2009; Thomopoulos et al., 
2010). The functionally graded tissue, necessary for reducing stress concentrations at the interface 
between two dissimilar materials, is not regenerated after enthesis degeneration or injury, resulting in a 
mechanically weak attachment and ultimately rupture (Carpenter et al., 1998; Thomopoulos et al., 2003). 
For this reason, failure rates after surgical repair of torn tendon to bone are remarkably high (Galatz et 
al., 2004; Harryman et al., 2003). Despite significant treatment advances over the past decade, the 
development of therapeutic strategies for regenerating the enthesis has been hampered by an incomplete 
understanding of enthesis development. In particular, it remains unclear how a spatial gradient in cell 
phenotypes forms across the enthesis to drive the formation of a mineral gradient from tendon to bone. 
With the maturity of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, it is now possible to evaluate 
the transcriptional signatures of the cell phenotypes across the enthesis at single-cell resolution.  
Resident stem cells have been identified for bone (i.e., bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) 
and tendon, but not for the enthesis. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been studied 
for many decades (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2018; Graham et al., 1990; Jiang et al., 
2002). More recently, tendon stem cells have been isolated and characterized, demonstrating typical 
stem cell features, including self-renewal capacity, clonogenicity, and multipotency (Bi et al., 2007). Due 
to a lack of distinct and reliable markers to identify tendon stem cells, their in vivo identity, contribution to 
tendon pathology, and translational application remain elusive (Millar et al., 2021). Recently, cells 
expressing Gli1 (glioma-associated oncogene homolog1, indicative of activated hedgehog signaling), 
have been proposed to function as progenitors residing in the tendon enthesis and in the epitenon 
(Felsenthal et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017b). Our previous lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated 
that Gli1-lineage (Gli1+) cells build the tendon enthesis and their ablation at early postnatal timepoints 
leads  to  defects  in  enthesis  mineralization  and  biomechanical  function  (Schwartz  et  al.,  2015). 
Furthermore, neonatal enthesis injuries showed excellent capacity to heal, and this process involved 
Gli1+ enthesis cells from the early postnatal period (Schwartz et al., 2017). Consistent with these findings, 
multiple studies have also demonstrated that Gli1+ cells form an essential niche in the colon by renewing 
stem cells, drive bone marrow fibrosis by activating cell expansion and myofibroblast differentiation, and 
regulate  bone  formation  and  fracture  repair  by  differentiating  into  chondrocytes  and  osteoblasts 
(Degirmenci et al., 2018; Kramann et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014). 
Gli1 therefore serves as a putative stem cell marker with particular relevance to the enthesis. However, 
the characteristics of enthesis Gli1 stem cells and their therapeutic potential have not been explored.    
Herein, we revealed enthesis cell heterogeneity and identified six cell sub-populations using scRNA-seq. 
We used two different algorithms for scRNA-seq analysis to infer cell differentiation trajectories for 
enthesis stem cells differentiating into mineralizing chondrocytes. A gene regulatory network analysis 
and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were then used to identify a number of transcription factors 
coordinating tenogenesis, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis to form an enthesis with spatially graded 
mineralization. To further define the enthesis stem cell population, enthesis Gli1+ cells were isolated and 
their transcriptomes were characterized at single cell resolution. These Gli1+ cells were shown to have

colony formation capacity and multipotency. Finally, Gli1+ stem cells were transplanted into injured 
entheses  and  shown  to  promote  extracellular  matrix  deposition  and  increased  mineralization, 
demonstrating a promising therapeutic strategy for enthesis regeneration.   
Results 
Single-cell  transcriptomes  of  enthesis  mesenchymal  cells  demonstrate  six  distinct  cell 
phenotypes 
To capture single-cell transcriptomes of enthesis cells during the critical postnatal mineralization period, 
we isolated mouse supraspinatus tendon entheses from shoulders of C57BL/J6 mice at postnatal day 7 
(P7), P18, and P56 and dissociated the enthesis cells for scRNA-seq analysis using the 10x Genomics 
platform (Figure S1A, B). After the elimination of doublets, dead, and apoptotic cells, 3,000-5,000 single 
cells with 61,990-106,444 reads/cell and 1,901-3,154 genes/cell for each timepoint passed quality control 
and  were  processed  for  downstream  evaluation  (Figure  S1C).  After  data  integration  of  different 
timepoints,  dimensional  reduction,  and  UMAP  (uniform  manifold  approximation  and  projection) 
visualization using the Seurat V3 package, 7 distinct cell clusters were manually annotated according to 
differentially expressed genes and a set of marker genes (Figures 1A and S1D). Similarly, enthesis 
mesenchymal cells were selected and clustered with high resolution and cell subpopulations were 
annotated  as  enthesis  progenitors,  pre-enthesoblasts,  enthesoblasts,  mineralizing  chondrocytes, 
tenoblasts/osteoblasts, and osteocytes (Figure 1B). Strikingly, the greatest percentage of mineralizing 
chondrocytes (normalized by the number of enthesis stromal cells) was observed at P18 compared to 
P11 and P56 (Figure 1C). This observation is consistent with previous research, which revealed active 
enthesis mineralization between P14 and P21 (Fang et al., 2020; Schwartz et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 
2012). In contrast, the proportion of the other cell subpopulations remained steady across developmental 
stages (Figures 1C and S2A).   
Enthesis progenitors had relatively high expression of Ly6a, Cd34, Cd44, and Pdgfra, in agreement with 
fibro-adipogenic progenitors previously found in tendon, bone marrow, muscle, and colon (De Micheli et 
al., 2020; Degirmenci et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2019; Tikhonova et al., 2019), (Figures 1D and S2B). 
Pre-enthesoblasts were identified and defined based on their clear stem cell transcriptional signatures, 
but at depressed levels relative to enthesis progenitors, particularly for stem cell maintenance and 
activated differentiation and transition (Figure S2C). A unique cell subpopulation co-expressing tenogenic 
(e.g., Scx, Col1a1) and chondrogenic markers (e.g., Sox9, Acan), consistent with previous reports of late 
fetal enthesis cells (Blitz et al., 2013), were defined as enthesoblasts. We also identified signature profiles 
of mineralizing chondrocytes (e.g., Sox9, Acan, Col2a1, Alpl, Spp1, Ibsp), tenoblasts/osteoblasts (e.g., 
Scx,  Tnmd,  Col1a1,  Nfatc1,  Bglap),  and  osteocytes  (e.g.,  Nfatc1,  Bglap,  Spp1,  Dmp1).  All  cell 
subpopulations were actively expressing their corresponding signature genes and deactivating other 
listed gene sets at P18 (Figure S2B). To determine cellular functions across varied cell subpopulations 
or development stages, we then performed single-cell gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis. The 
biological processes matrix strength, bone growth, cartilage development, collagen formation, and 
chondrocyte differentiation were significantly more enriched at P11 and P18 compared to P56 (Figure 
1E). The biological processes fibroblasts proliferation, cytoskeleton function, stem cell differentiation, and 
Runx1 in Wnt signaling were significantly more enriched at P56 compared to the earlier timepoints. 
Enthesoblasts had the most enriched profiles of matrix deposition and tissue development. These 
findings demonstrate six distinct enthesis cell populations at early postnatal timepoints that activate 
several biological processes to build and mineralize the enthesis.

Candidate regulators for enthesis progenitor cell differentiation and mineralization defined by 
single-cell network inference (SCENIC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
To determine the gene regulatory network that defines enthesis maturity and cell fate, we applied 
SCENIC analysis to the enthesis mesenchymal cell data (Aibar et al., 2017). This analysis revealed that 
P11 and P18 enthesis cells had enriched transcription factor regulons related to tissue mineralization 
compared to P56 enthesis cells (i.e., Sox9, Runx2, Mef2a, Mef3c, Foxa3, and Nfatc1 regulons; Figure 
2A). Consistent with this finding, expression of the master transcription factors for these regulons, such 
as  Sox9,  Mef2a,  Mef2c,  and  Foxa3,  were  upregulated  in  mineralizing  chondrocytes,  particularly 
compared  to  tenoblasts/osteoblasts  and  osteocytes  (Figure  S3),  implying  that  the  mineralizing 
chondrocyte was the major cell subpopulation responsible for enthesis mineralization. Interestingly, 
Cebpd and Myc regulons were upregulated at P56 compared to the earlier timepoints, implying their 
possible roles in driving enthesis maturity. The regulons and associated master transcription factors 
specific for stem cell maintenance and differentiation (i.e., Creb5, Bcl3, Egr1, Tcf4, and Creb3l1) were 
generally enriched for enthesis progenitors, pre-enthesoblasts, and enthesoblasts (Figure 2A,B, S3). The 
Creb3l1 regulon was enriched only in enthesoblasts, revealing a putative factor unique to enthesis 
development. This Creb3l1 regulon includes potential tenogenic target genes (e.g., Scx, Mkx, Tnc, 
Col1a1, Fmod) as binding sites for Creb3l1 (Figure 2B). Finally, SCENIC analysis also detected enriched 
Sox9 and Runx2 regulons underlying enthesis development and mineralization, in line with previous 
reports  demonstrating  essential  roles  for  Sox9  and  Runx2  in  cartilage  and  bone  development, 
respectively  (Long  and  Ornitz,  2013).  The  identification  of  the  master  regulators  driving  enthesis 
mineralization and maturity provides a rich set of hypothesis-generating results for future study. To 
corroborate the scRNA-seq findings and evaluate spatiotemporal expression levels of key representative 
genes in the enthesis, we performed single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine 
mRNA of progenic markers (i.e., Cebpd, Ly6a, Cd34), and osteogenic markers (i.e., Nfatc1, Mef2a, 
Runx2, Foxa3). Tendon enthesis sections were analyzed at P7, P18, and P56. Consistent with scRNA-
seq results (Figure 2C), FISH demonstrated positive expression of these genes and revealed their spatial 
expression patterns (Figures 2D and S4). Cebpd expression was greater in the enthesis at P18 than at 
P7 and P56. In contrast, Ly6a expression showed low levels of expression across all three timepoints, 
whereas Cd34 expression increased with time. This contrasts with scRNA-seq analysis, which showed 
similar expression levels for Cd34, Ly6a, and Cebpd in enthesis progenitors and pre-enthesoblasts 
across timepoints. This may be due to the different approaches and normalization schemes; for FISH 
analysis, cell numbers positive for expression were normalized by the total number of enthesis cells, 
whereas scRNA-seq analysis compared gene expression levels for each cell subpopulation. Additionally, 
expression patterns of these progenic markers were not dependent on enthesis region. For osteogenic 
markers, Nfatc1 expression was consistent across all timepoints, whereas Foxa3 expression increased 
with enthesis maturity. Of note, Mef2a and Runx2 expressions were more abundant at P18 than P7 and 
P56, consistent with the greatest number of mineralizing chondrocytes at P18 (Figure 1C). As expected, 
osteogenic markers, such as Mef2a Runx2, and Foxa3, were more highly expressed at the zones of 
mineralized fibrocartilage and bone than tendon.  
Enthesis  stem  cell  differentiation  trajectories  reveal  a  path  from  enthesis  progenitors  to 
mineralizing chondrocytes  
To explore the origin and lineage trajectories of enthesis mesenchymal cells, we applied Monocle 3 
(Trapnell et al., 2014) and ScVelo (Bergen et al., 2020) algorithms to the scRNA-seq data to infer

differentiation paths. Monocle 3 uses an unsupervised algorithm, without prior knowledge, to order whole-
transcriptome profiles of single cells. The RNA velocity algorithm (Trapnell et al., 2014), on the other 
hand, predicts future cell states based on the time derivative of the gene expression pattern. Cross-
referred  results  from  the  two  algorithms,  therefore,  provides  a  robust  approach  for  determining 
differentiation  trajectories.    Partition-based  graph  abstraction  (PAGA)  maps  from  ScVelo  analysis 
suggested that both pre-enthesoblasts and enthesoblasts originated from enthesis progenitors, and 
enthesoblasts had a greater chance to branch into mineralizing chondrocytes and tenoblasts/osteoblasts 
than osteocytes (Figure 3A). Strikingly, projection of all cells along the latent time of RNA velocity 
revealed a clear separation of P56 enthesis cells from P11 and P18 enthesis cells (Figure 3B and S5A). 
This demonstrates a strong connection between P11 and P18 enthesis cell RNA velocities, whereas P56 
enthesis cells may have reached homeostasis and their expression profiles are distinct from the earlier 
postnatal stages. Ly6a and Cd34, considered progenitor markers, had relatively higher expression levels 
and RNA velocities in enthesis progenitors (Figure 3C and S5B). Similarly, tenogenic markers (i.e., Scx, 
Tnmd), chondrogenic makers (i.e., Sox9, Col X), and osteogenic markers (i.e., Runx2, Ibsp, Foxa3) were 
enriched in corresponding cell subpopulations with respect to gene expression levels and RNA velocities 
(Figure  3C,  S5B  and  S5C).  Enthesoblasts,  tenoblasts/osteoblasts,  mineralizing  chondrocytes,  and 
osteocytes were selected to estimate trajectories of enthesis mesenchymal cell differentiation using RNA 
velocity (Figure 3D). Mineralizing chondrocytes, tenoblasts/osteoblasts, and osteocytes were rooted in 
enthesoblasts.  Consistent  with  this  ScVelo  analysis,  Monocle  analysis  also  inferred  that  enthesis 
progenitors were the original cell population leading to pre-enthesoblasts and enthesoblasts, which then 
branched into either mineralizing chondrocytes, tenoblasts/osteoblasts, and enthesoblasts (Figure 3E). 
Integration of data from all three timepoints and ordered along pseudotime by Monocle revealed a clear 
temporal trajectory from enthesis progenitors to pre-enthesoblasts, then enthesoblasts, and finally 
mineralizing chondrocytes (Figure 3E). Overall, comparison of trajectory analyses from Monocle and 
RNA velocity revealed clear lineage trajectories of enthesis mesenchymal cells originating from enthesis 
progenitors.  
Enthesis progenitors demonstrate clonogenicity and multipotency 
In our previous work, we described a unique subpopulation of Gli1+ cells that originated in utero were 
distinct from tendon fibroblasts and epiphyseal chondrocytes (Schwartz et al., 2015). These cells were 
responsible for building and mineralizing the enthesis and were maintained in the mature enthesis. 
Furthermore, we found that Gli1+ cells were actively involved in healing neonatal enthesis injuries 
(Schwartz et al., 2017). Motivated by these prior studies and the scRNA-seq analysis of enthesis 
mesenchymal cells identifying enthesis progenitors, we explored the nature of enthesis-specific Gli1+ 
cells as a putative resident source of enthesis progenitors. Gli1+ cells were isolated using fluorescence 
activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed using scRNA-seq and in vitro clonogenicity and multipotency 
assays. Integration of scRNA-seq data of Gli1+ cells from seven timepoints spanning the range from 
neonatal  enthesis  development  to  maturity  revealed  that  Gli1+  cells  had  abundant  expression  of 
progenitor markers, including Ly6a, Cd44, Cd34, and Pdgfra (Figure 4A). Clonogenicity was then 
compared among Gli1+ cells, Gli+Ly6a+Cd44+ cells (Gl1+ cells further sorted by FACS for these two 
progenitor markers; Figure 4B), and tendon ScxGFP cells (i.e., mature tenocytes, considered a negative 
control). Gli1+ cells had better capacity to form colonies compared to ScxGFP cells (Figure 4B). 
Remarkably, Gli1+ progenitors with expression of Ly6a and Cd44 were seven times as clonogenic as 
ScxGFP cells and twice as clonogenic as Gli1+ cells. To evaluate whether Gli1+ cells were the source of 
mesenchymal cells at the enthesis, scRNA-seq data of isolated Gli1+ cells were integrated with data from 
5

all enthesis mesenchymal cells. Gli1+ cells were distributed across the entire UMAP of all enthesis 
mesenchymal cells, suggesting that Gli1+ cells have the capacity to differentiate into all enthesis cell 
phenotypes (Figure 4C). To examine multipotency, Gli1+ cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem 
cells  (MSCs,  positive  control),  and  tendon  ScxGFP  cells  (negative  control)  were  cultured  under 
adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic conditions (Figure 4D). Like MSCs, Gli1+ cells had both 
osteogenic and chondrogenic potentials. However, they did not show adipogenic capacity. This suggests 
that enthesis Gli1+ cells have primed and irreversible differentiation potential, possibly defined by their 
specific niches within the enthesis (Harvey et al., 2019). Importantly, differentiated chondrocyte pellets 
from  Gli1+  cells  but  not  MSCs  and  ScxGFP  cells,  had  the  morphology,  lacunae,  and  deposited 
surrounding matrix similar to that of tendon enthesis, suggesting that Gli1+ cells could serve as a source 
for enhanced enthesis healing.  
Enthesis Gli1-lineage cells have a linear differentiation trajectory 
A lineage-tracing approach was taken to characterize the path of enthesis cells from progenitor through 
mature phenotypes. Gli1+ enthesis cells were tracked by injecting Gli1CreERT2;Ai14 mice with tamoxifen 
at P5 and P7 (Figure 5A). Our prior work demonstrated that this approach is effective in identifying 
enthesis lineage cells through skeletally mature stages (Schwartz et al., 2017; Schwartz et al., 2015). 
Gli1+ cells were isolated from microdissected entheses and sorted by FACS. After quality control and 
filtering, as described in the methods section, Gli1+ cells from seven timepoints were integrated and 
grouped into five clusters (Figure 5B). Gli1+cells had a significant cluster of enthesis progenitors marked 
by Ly6a and C34, concordantly with the previous analysis of all enthesis cells (Figures 1D and 2C). The 
composition of the cell clusters did not change over time, indicating that descendants of Gli1+ cells with 
different phenotypes were evenly distributed across the enthesis (Figure 5C and S6A). As expected, 
each Gli1+ cell cluster expressed the expected markers: progenic (i.e., Ly6a, Cd34), tenogenic (i.e., Scx, 
Tnmd), chondrogenic (i.e., Sox9, Acan), and osteogenic (i.e., Nfatc1, Lbsp) (Figure 5D). The pseudotime 
trajectory of Gli1+ cells by Monocle 3 analysis revealed a linear lineage progression from enthesis 
progenitors to pre-enthesoblasts, enthesoblasts, chondrocytes, and finally to mineralizing chondrocytes 
(Figure 5E). The trajectory analysis was further corroborated by enriched expression of Ly6a only in 
enthesis progenitors, Col1a1 and Fmod only in enthesoblasts, and Col2a1 and Sox9 only in chondrocytes 
and mineralizing chondrocytes (Figure 5F).  
Chondrocytes  and  mineralizing  chondrocytes  are  more  involved  in  enthesis  formation  and 
maturity 
To more deeply evaluate the biological processes driving Gli1+ cell differentiation, single sample gene 
set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis was performed (Chen et al., 2019). Among the five clusters of Gli1+ 
cells, chondrocytes and mineralizing chondrocytes showed the highest activity, particularly for processes 
related to bone growth and ossification, cartilage development, collagen formation, and chondrocyte 
differentiation (Figure 6A). This suggests that chondrocytes and mineralizing chondrocytes are the key 
contributors to extracellular matrix deposition and mineralization. We then performed SCENIC analysis 
to this dataset to explore transcription factor regulons responsible for mediating Gli1+ cell differentiation 
and focused on transcription factor regulons related with phenotype shifts and maintenance of enthesis 
progenitors and mineralizing chondrocytes (Figure 6B). Cebpd expression and regulons were more 
enriched in enthesis progenitors than in the other cell clusters (Figures 6B and 6C). Jun and Egr1 
regulons were also more activated in enthesis progenitors. Distinct from the Egr1 regulon, downstream 
genes of Cebpd regulons were related to progenitor function and tenogenesis (Figure S6C). Although

Pou3f3 had relatively low gene expression, the Pou3f3 regulon was highly activated in chondrocytes and 
mineralizing chondrocytes (Figures 6B and C). As shown by the scRNA-seq analysis of all enthesis cells, 
both  expression  and  regulon  activities  of  Nfatc1  and  Foxa3  were  enriched  in  chondrocytes  and 
mineralizing chondrocytes. Expression patterns of progenic and osteogenic markers were confirmed 
across development stages (Figure 6D). Progenic markers, such as C34, Ly6a, and Cebpd were down-
regulated at P7 compared to late postnatal timepoints in progenitors. This was also the case for 
osteogenic markers Foxa3, Mef2a, and Nfatc1. Of note, the expression of Mef2a, which has been 
reported to regulate bone formation by controlling SOST in osteocytes (Leupin et al., 2007), increased 
with enthesis maturity from P7 to P42.  
Therapeutic potential of Gli1+ progenitor cells for enthesis healing  
Gli1+ cells are necessary to build the enthesis, express progenitor cell markers, and show multipotency 
and clonogenicity in vitro. We therefore explored the therapeutic potential of Gli1+ cells to enhance 
enthesis  healing,  with  the  long-term  goal  of  developing  a  stem-cell-based  treatment  for  enthesis 
regeneration. Gli1+ cells were sorted from mouse entheses, expanded in vitro, and transplanted to injured 
entheses (Schwartz et al., 2017). Gli1+ cells engrafted onto the injury site and were retained from post-
operative day 1 (POD1) to POD7 (Figure S7D). Enthesis injury defects became smaller with time, with 
deposition of new extracellular matrix (Figures 7A). Enthesis injuries treated with Gli1+ cells had smaller 
gaps and greater mineralization than untreated enthesis injuries. Quantification of microCT data showed 
that bone density and volume of injured regions increased with time and were significantly greater in 
Gli1+ treated injuries compared to control, particularly at POD28 (Figure 7). Trabecular bone thickness 
in Gli1+ cell-treated injuries was significantly less than control at POD7, but similar at the other timepoints. 
Histologically, collagen fiber aligned improved and cell density decreased with time (Figure 7A,B). More 
extracellular matrix (including cartilaginous tissue) was deposited at the injured region in the Gli1+ cell-
treated group than control, especially at POD28. Semi-quantitative analysis of histology images showed 
that there was a progressive reduction in histological score towards normal, with significantly better 
healing in the Gli1+ cell treated group (Figure 7B, S7F). To verify that the positive effects of Gli1+ cell 
treatment was due to their enthesis progenitor cell nature, we delivered ScxGFP cells extracted from 
adult tendons (which do not show progenitor characteristics, Figure 4B,D) to the injury site in a separate 
group of animals. Treatment with ScxGFP tendon cells showed less organized collagen fibers and 
decreased cartilaginous tissues at POD11 relative to Gli1+ cell-treated injuries (Figure S7E). The results 
demonstrate the therapeutic potential for Gli1+ stem cell therapy for enhanced enthesis healing. 
Heterotopic ossification (HO) was also found adjacent to injured entheses in many cases (Figures 7C, 
S7A). More and larger ossified tissues were identified at Gli1+ cell-treated injuries at POD14 and POD28 
compared to the control group. To explore the mechanisms driving heterotopic ossification, we correlated 
the scRNA-seq data of enthesis Gli1+ cells with a list of known gene markers for HO. Prg4 and Ctsk are 
associated with osteogenic differentiation at subchondral bone and ligament and tendon (Feng et al., 
2020; Novince et al., 2012). Gnas, an osteochondral progenitor gene, is associated with osteogenic 
differentiation through Wnt signaling (Khan et al., 2018). Mutation of Mkx has been reported to cause 
aberrant differentiation of tendon progenitors leading to tendon ossification (Liu et al., 2019). In the 
current study, expression of Prg4, Ctsk, Gnas1, and Mkx were more abundant in enthesoblasts than in 
the other cell clusters. These results highlight that enthesoblasts can serve as a cell source for tendon 
heterotopic  ossification  and  are  a  potential  target  for  inhibiting  tendon  heterotopic  ossification  in 
pathologic settings.

Discussion 
The enthesis serves a critical function in the musculoskeletal system: transferring muscle forces from 
tendon to bone to achieve joint motion. Prior work has focused on understanding tendon enthesis 
structure, function, and pathology, but the nature and phenotype shift of enthesis stem cells has remained 
elusive. Here, we report a detailed transcriptional profile of enthesis mesenchymal cells, including 
characterization of cell types, exploration of the underlying gene regulatory network, and differentiation 
path of enthesis progenitor cells to mature enthesis cells. A set of transcription factor regulons, defined 
by analysis of single-cell transcriptome data and localized to the enthesis by FISH, were identified, 
specifically  for  progenitor  function,  enthesis  mineralization,  chondrogenesis,  tenogenesis,  and 
osteogenesis. Importantly, enthesis progenitors were identified, demonstrating expression of Gli1, Cd34, 
Cd44, and Ly6a and in vitro clonogenicity and multipotency. These newly identified enthesis stem cells 
demonstrated therapeutic potential for improving enthesis healing. 
The development of effective treatments for the tendon enthesis requires a deeper understanding of 
enthesis cell biology, especially regarding the spatial gradient in cell phenotype from unmineralized to 
mineralized tissue (Gracey et al., 2020). Fibroblast-like stromal cells, typically denoted as “tenocytes”, 
have been reported as the main cell type in healthy tendon (Fang and Lake, 2016; Millar et al., 2021). 
These spindle shaped cells are dispersed along collagen fibers and are responsible for maintaining 
tendon extracellular matrix (Fang and Lake, 2017; Fang and Lake, 2015). The tendon surface contains 
an additional resident cell population, αSMA-positive myofibroblasts, which respond to injury and infiltrate 
the torn region (Best et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017b). Additionally, various immune cell subtypes, 
whether resident or recruited, are involved in the initiation and progression of tendon degeneration and 
injury, but the role of this immune cell subpopulation is controversial for healthy and homeostatic tissues 
(Gracey et al., 2020). Notably, resident tendon stem/progenitor cells have been identified and isolated 
based on their in vitro behavior (Bi et al., 2007). Although the use of tendon stem cells or stem cell-
derived exosomes in animal models is attractive, the lack of determined stem cell markers and knowledge 
about molecular mechanisms driving their behavior hinders their translational application (Millar et al., 
2021). To explore these concepts in the enthesis, we used whole transcriptomic profiles to define six cell 
subpopulations  in  mouse  supraspinatus  tendon  according  to  gene  markers  related to  stem  cells, 
tenogenesis, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis. Enthesis progenitors shared similar markers with fibro-
adipogenic progenitors found in tendon (Harvey et al., 2019), bone marrow (Zhong et al., 2020), and 
muscle  (De  Micheli  et  al.,  2020).  Different  from  progenitors,  pre-entheoblasts  had  a  transitional 
expressing profile with up-regulated genes involved in cell differentiation and down-regulated genes 
attributed to maintenance of progenitor status. An interesting cell subpopulation possessing expression 
patterns of both tenogenesis and chondrogenesis were labeled as enthesoblasts. This is consistent with 
previous reports that a distinct cell pool, which expresses both the tenogenic marker Scx and the 
chondrogenic marker Sox9 (and are not derived from chondrocytes), are found at the enthesis during 
pre-mineralization fetal timepoints (Blitz et al., 2013; Sugimoto et al., 2013). We suggest that another cell 
subtype, which we termed “mineralizing chondrocyte”, is responsible for the graded structure of enthesis 
from unmineralized to mineralized fibrocartilage as it showed activated expression profiles of both 
chondrogenic and osteogenic markers and clearly played an essential role in enthesis mineralization. 
Systematic examination of the gene regulatory network defining enthesis cell phenotypes revealed a 
group of new transcription factors that regulate lineage progression from progenitor to mature enthesis 
cell. Further in vitro screening and in vivo animal models are needed to show whether these factors are

necessary and sufficient to drive enthesis progenitor cell differentiation. Nevertheless, a set of new gene 
markers was identified for the various cell subtypes in the tendon enthesis. These markers will allow for 
examination of cell phenotype shifts in degenerated or diseased conditions, e.g., towards fibrous, 
cartilaginous, and/or ossified tissues in tendon and enthesis. Corroborating with the literature that Sox9 
is required for chondrogenesis, including at the mineralizing growth plate (Akiyama et al., 2002; Harada 
and Rodan, 2003; Kronenberg, 2003) , Sox9 was confirmed in our data as a downstream target gene 
contributing to enthesis chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Similarly, Runx2 is known as the earliest 
determinant of osteoblast differentiation (Wei et al., 2015), and was also found to be highly activated in 
enthesis mineralizing chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Our work further highlighted that Cebpd, Nfia, and 
Egr play a role in mediating downstream genes ranging from progenic to osteogenic markers. Egr1 has 
been shown to coordinate matrix production and further mediate musculoskeletal tissue formation (Havis 
and Duprez, 2020; Lejard et al., 2011), but the roles of Cebpd and Nfia in musculoskeletal tissues are 
not clear. Nfia has been suggested to be expressed in the tendon enthesis and to safeguard stem cell 
identity in hair follicles (Adam et al., 2020; Kult et al., 2021). A discovery in this study is that six typical 
tenocyte markers (e.g., Scx, Mkx, Tnc, Col1a1, Col1a2, Fmod) were identified to be regulated by Creb3l1, 
whose  role  has  not  been  previously  reported  for  tendon  development,  with  only  some  evidence 
suggesting its involvement in collagen metabolic process via TGFβ signaling (Chen et al., 2014; 
Murakami et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2020). Finally, Runx2, Mef2a, Mef2c, Foxa3, and Nfatc1 were found 
here to regulate downstream target cofactors required for enthesis chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, 
consistent with prior literature (Asagiri et al., 2005; Ionescu et al., 2012; Leupin et al., 2007b). Therefore, 
these  newly  identified  enthesis  transcription  factors  and  their  related  downstream  cofactors  are 
temporospatially coordinated to drive progenitor commitment to intended cell fates and then produce a 
spatially graded mineralized structure at the tendon-bone interface. 
Gli1+ cells have been identified in stem cell niches of a wide range of tissues. These cells function as 
stem/progenitor cells responsible for formation and homeostasis of tissues such as bone, teeth, tendon, 
colon, kidney, and heart (Degirmenci et al., 2018; Kramann et al., 2016; Kramann et al., 2015; Men et 
al., 2020; Schneider et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017). The current work demonstrates that Gli1+ cells are 
also a specialized pool of resident enthesis progenitor cells. This finding has significant implications for 
the treatment of enthesis disorders and holds great promise for enhancing tendon-to-bone repair. 
Enthesis Gli1+ progenitors share similar transcriptional signatures with mesenchymal stem cells, such 
as enriched Ly6a, Cd34, and Pdgfra, and have the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types. In the 
context of enthesis development, Gli1+ progenitors have a linear lineage trajectory from progenitor to 
mature enthesis cell and populate all enthesis cell subtypes across the transition from tendon to bone. 
Although the overlap of transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of Gli1+ progenitors from various tissues 
remains unknown, their resident environment might dictate a limited range of phenotypes specific to the 
particular tissue. For the enthesis, Gli1+ progenitors were only capable of in vitro differentiation into 
chondrocytes and osteoblasts, but not adipocytes.  
Development of therapeutic strategies focused on Gli1+ progenitors may have a wide application to 
various enthesis injury and degeneration scenarios. For enthesitis, suppression of these cells may 
mitigate the formation of osteophytes. For tendon-to-bone repair, promotion (or delivery) of these cells 
may lead to regeneration of a functionally graded enthesis. However, several challenges exist for 
implementing these strategies. Due to the challenges of harvesting sufficient Gli1+ progenitors from 
tissues, the decrease in Gli1+ cells with age, and the need to expand cells in vitro prior for transplantation

(with potential loss of cell phenotype), the therapeutic use of primary Gli1+ progenitor cells is unlikely.  It 
will likely be necessary to use mesenchymal stem cells from another source, or induced pluripotent stem 
cells, differentiated into enthesis-specific Gli1+ progenitors (Lindvall et al., 2004). Achieving this requires 
a complete understanding of the gene regulatory network that drives stem cells to become the range of 
enthesis cell phenotypes. Furthermore, careful design of a cell delivery system is necessary to maintain 
progenitor cell features after transplantation, engraft cells to the injured region, and promote cell 
integration and directed differentiation. As presented in our study, Gli1+ cell transplantation can increase 
matrix deposition and mineralization of injured enthesis but can also cause heterotopic ossification; this 
was attributed to the limited ability of the collagen gel carrier to retain cells at the injured site. These 
results also imply that undesired differentiation of Gli1+ progenitors during tendon and kidney calcification 
and bone marrow fibrosis might be inhibited by preventing proliferation and differentiation of these cells 
(Kramann et al., 2016; Kramann et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2017). This can be realized by inactivating 
molecular signals such as the transcription factors identified in the current study, e.g., by regulating 
hedgehog signaling components such as Ptch1 and Gli1 or using many available antagonists or agonists 
(Amakye et al., 2013).  
Limitations of Study 
Enthesis cells reside within a dense extracellular matrix, much of it mineralized. Therefore, extraction of 
cells for FACS and scRNA-seq requires a relatively harsh digestion protocol. The digestion environment 
and mechanical perturbation by sorting could cause a change in the expression profiles of the cells (van 
den Brink et al., 2017). However, we demonstrated that the application of chemical digestion and FACS-
activated cell sorting resulted in more than 75% viability of cells from the enthesis. Furthermore, cells 
from all isolation timepoints were dissociated using the same protocol so that comparison of their 
transcriptomes would be valid. Future work will include spatial transcriptomics to address possible 
dissociation artifacts and gain spatial information. A second limitation in the study was that delivery of 
Gli1+ cells to the injured enthesis could lead to heterotopic ossification in some cases. This was likely 
due to the delivery system used, which did not retain all cells at the repair site post-implantation. To avoid 
heterotopic ossification in tendon, future experiments will use a biomimetic adhesive material to localize 
and retain the cells to the injury site.

EXPERMINETAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETALS 
 
Animal models 
All animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University’s institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Wild-type animals used for 10x Genomics Chromium 3' Single Cell RNA-Seq analysis and 
injury models were C57BL/6J mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory. To harvest Gli1-lineage cells for 
pooled 3'-End scRNA-Seq in 96-well plates, in vitro experiment, and cell transplantation for injured models, 
Gli1CreERT mice (Schwartz et al., 2015) were crossed with Ai14 mice. Gli1CreERT;Ai14 mice were further 
crossed with ScxGFP mice. Both Gli1CreERT;Ai14 mice and Gli1CreERT;Ai14;ScxGFP mice were injected 
with tamoxifen at P5 and P7 and used in our study. Mice were maintained in a standard cages under a 
standard 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.  
Primary cell culture 
Gli1-lineage cells were dissected, dissociated (described below), and sorted by Fluorescence-activated 
Cell Sorting and then cultured in growth medium containing αMEM medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 
1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were subsequently harvested at passage three for in vitro differentiation 
assays and transplantation in injured mice.  
METHOD DETAILS 
Single cell isolation for 10x Genomics Chromium  
Tendon entheses n=12-16/timepoint for 10 Genomics) from P11, P18, and P56 C57BL/6J mice were 
dissected under surgical microscope and pooled together (Figure S1B). They were digested in HBSS 
solution with 300 mg/ml liberase, 20 ng/ml Dnase, 5% FBS, and 100 mg/ml HEPES for 1.5 hours at 37 
celsius degree. The samples were filtered through a 40 μm strain, resuspended in the RBC lysis buffer for 
5 minutes at room temperature to lyse erythrocytes and stained with Cd45 in 200 μl PBS with 5% FBS for 
45 minutes at 4°C to exclude hematopoietic cells. Then, the samples were washed with PBS three times, 
resuspended in 500 μl PBS with 1 ug/ml DAPI and 5% FBS, and filtered into polypropylene FACS tubes. 
Single cells without Cd45 and DAPI staining were index sorted by a BD influx Sorter and collected into a 
microcentrifuge tube for scRNA-seq 10 Genomics experiments.  
Single cell isolation for scRNA-seq in 96-well plates 
For experiments of 3'-End scRNA-Seq in 96-well plates, tendon entheses (n=3/time point) of GliCreERT;Ai14 
mice of P7, P11, P18, P21, P28, and P42 were dissected, pooled together, and digested in the 
aforementioned solution under the same condition discussed above. All cells were stained with 1 ug/ml 
DAPI and were index sorted by a BD influx Sorter. Single cells without DAPI staining and red fluorescence 
were collected into 96-well plates, prefilled with lysis buffer for scRNA-Seq analysis.  
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  
Tendon-bone samples of C57BL/6J mice  at P7, P18, and P56 (n=4/timepoint) were fixed in 10% 
formaldehyde for three hours, permeabilized in 30% sucrose overnight, embedded in OCT compound, and 
crosectioned into 10 μm-thick tissue slices. Tissue slices were treated with 5 μg/ml Proteinase K for 10 
minutes and RNA FISH of these slices was performed using RNAscope FISH techniques according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Barry et al., 2013). To visualize the mRNA spatiotemporal expression pattern, 
in situ hybridization was conducted using the positive and negative probes as control and also the probes 
against Cebpd, Cd34, Foxa3, Ly6a, Mef2a, Nfatc1, and Runx2. After hybridization, tissue slices were

counterstained with DAPI and mounted for images. All FISH image stacks were collected on a Nikon TI 
Eclipse inverted microscope with a 20X and 60X oil objective for visualization. All imaging parameters of 
confocal microscope were maintained consistently for FISH. ImageJ software (National Institute of Health) 
was used to equally perform post-imaging manipulations and quantify percentage of cells with positive 
staining normalized by the total cell number from histological sections. Maximal projection of image stacks 
was presented as representative FISH images.  
Colony formation assay  
GliCreERT;Ai14 mice;ScxGFP mice at P11 were injected with tamoxifen injected at P5 and P7. Tendon 
entheses and partial tendons of three or four GliCreERT;Ai14 mice;ScxGFP mice at P11 were pooled and 
digested for harvesting cells. All cells were stained with antibody cocktails of Cd44 and Ly6a in PBS for 45 
minutes at 4°C, washed three times, and then stained with 1 ug/ml DAPI for sorting. We aimed to sort out 
three types of cells (n=3-5/each type): Gli1+ Ly6a+ Cd44+ DAPI- enthesis cells (Gli1 progenitors); Gli1+ 
DAPI- cells (Gli1+ cells); ScxGFP+ Gli1- DAPI- cells (ScxGFP cells). Single cells of three types were sorted 
in 96-well plates and cultured αMEM medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 
1 month. All were incubated with 0.5% crystal violet staining solution for 20 mins. The wells with more than 
100 cells were considered to have colonies. The percentage of colony formation was calculated by 
normalizing the number of colonies by 96, the total well number.  
In vitro multipotential differentiation assays 
Tendon entheses of GliCreERT;Ai14;ScxGFP mice at P11 and P28 (n=4-6/timepoint) with tamoxifen injected 
at P5 and P7 were pooled together and digested. Gli1+ cells and Gli1- ScxGFP+ cells were collected, 
cultured in the growth medium, and expanded until passage three for injury treatment. Mouse bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were harvested as positive control in parallel. All cells were expanded 
in αMEM medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After achieving 80% confluency, 
cells were trypsinized and separated for adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis assays.  
Cells were seeded on 6-well plates and incubated in culture medium overnight. Cells were then maintained 
in adipogenic, osteogenic, or chondrogenic differentiation mediums (Lonza) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. For checking adipogenesis, cells after culturing in two weeks were fixed in 10% formaldehyde 
and stained with Oil Red O. For osteogenesis evaluation, cells after maintaining in differentiation medium 
for 21 days were fixed and stained with 2% Alizarin Red S pH=4.2. For determining chondrogenesis, cells 
after differentiated for 28 days were stained with Alcian Blue pH=1.2.  
Cell preparation for transplantation 
Tendon entheses of GliCreERT;Ai14;ScxGFP mice at P1.  were pooled together and digested for harvesting 
Gli1+ cells. Gli1+ cells were collected, cultured in the growth medium, and expanded until passage three 
for injury treatment. To check the retention of Gli1+ cells at post-operative day (POD) 1, 3, and 7, cells were 
released from culturing dishes, incubated in Qtracker 705 Cell Labeling Kit for 1 hour following its protocol 
and washed twice. Finally, all cells were suspended in sterile 4mg/ml Collagen type I solution from rat tail 
at the concentration of 2X107 cells/ml.  
Needle punch enthesis injury and cell transplantation 
Enthesis injury protocols were adapted from our previous study (Schwartz et al., 2017).  After injection with 
buprenorphine SR and then isoflurane anesthesia, nine to ten-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n=6-8 with females 
and males for each group of post-operative day sacrifice) were placed in a lateral decubitus position. The 
upper limb was externally rotated to bring the forearm in supination and secured. An incision was made in 
the skin to visualize the deltoid. The deltoid was cut to expose the supraspinatus enthesis and humerus 
head. For the injured right shoulder treated with Gli1-lineage cells, 1X106 cells in 50 μl Collagen type I

solution and pumped into a syringe with a 28G needle. The needle was inserted into the tendon enthesis 
(close to the humeral head) to create a punch defect until the enthesis was completely bisected into the 
marrow cavity. The cells were gradually released from the syringe to fill the punched hole. For the 
contralateral left shoulder as control, only the punch injury was created. 5-0 PROLENE suture was used to 
ligate the deltoid back over the humerus and close the skin. After injury, mice experienced free cage activity 
and euthanized after 1, 2, and four weeks.  
Single cell RNA sequencing  
For 10x Genomics Chromium 3’ solution, the cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 mins, counted by a 
hemocytometer, and resuspended in PBS with 10% FBS. Approximately 5,000 cells were captured for each 
sample. The sorted cells were loaded into 10x Chromium Controller using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3 
reagents and prepared as droplets for lysis and reverse transcription. The resulting pooled, 3’-end libraries 
were sequenced on Illumina® NovaSeq™ 6000 Sequencer.  
For scRNA-Seq in 96-well plates, 96-well plates with cells in lysis buffer were spun down and processed 
with automated liquid handling robot. Adapter-linked oligo(dT) primers including both cell- and molecule-
specific  barcodes  were  used  to  complete  template-switching  reverse  transcription.  Pooled  3’-end 
sequencing libraries were finally sequenced on an IIlumina NextSeq 500.  
Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis 
Cell Ranger was used to demultiplex raw data for creating Fastq files. Following alignment and filtering, 
gene-level unique molecular identifier counts (UMIs) and gene expression matrix  were obtained for 
downstream analysis. R package Seurat was used as a first analytical tool to load data and build Seurat 
objects, which were processed for controlling data quality, filtering, clustering, and data visualization, and 
examining differential expression analysis. Specifically, cells with genes expressed less than 2 cells, 
cells<1000 UMIs with >20% UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes, and <200 genes were removed. After 
normalization of cells by the total UMI read counts, unsupervised shared nearest neighbor clustering (SNN) 
with an adjusted resolution were performed and displayed in Umap. Clusters were subset and identified by 
representative marker genes related with, for example, tenogenesis and chondrogenesis. Datasets at 
different timepoints were integrated via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and combined into a uniform 
Umap Alta. Shared patterns of transcriptional profile were highlighted by CCA analysis and shown by 
heatmap and dot plots.  
Gene regulatory network analysis 
For single cell regulatory network analysis, the SCENIC package (V1.2.2) was used with default settings to 
identify transcription networks. First, GENIE3 module identified target genes that were significantly co-
expressed with a certain transcription factor. Next, RcisTarget module predicted the target genes by 
screening the enriched cis-regulatory motifs of candidate transcription factors. Lastly, AUCell algorithm 
scored the activity of each regulon. Regulon activities to show the master regulators of each single cell 
were plotted by heatmap.  
Gene set enrichment analysis 
Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), which identified the enriched gene sets at a single 
cell level, was as previously described (Wang et al., 2017). In brief, we computed enrichment scores of a 
certain gene set for both the experimental dataset and a random permutated dataset of 1000 cells. 
Normalized gene expression matrix from Seurat analysis and gene sets of interest (from GSEA Molecular 
Signatures Database v7.2) were used as inputs. p values of each gene set were computed by comparing 
our dataset to the permutated dataset. The heatmaps showed –log (p values) of enriched gene sets using 
10
the ComplexHeatmap package (Gu et al., 2016).

Cell lineage trajectory analysis 
Following the instructed tutorial of Monocle 3 package with the default settings, detailed pseudotime for 
tendon enthesis resident cells over different time points (Trapnell et al., 2014). Cell clusters were also 
arranged along the pseudotime to represent the lineage trajectory. For RNA velocity, a loom file of spliced 
and unspliced mRNAs from aligned bam file using Velocyto package (V0.17.16) in Python (V3.6) was 
created. Then RNA velocity was computed based on both steady state and dynamic models using scVelo 
package (Bergen et al., 2020). The scVelo algorithm used raw read counts from sequencing and was 
insensitive to library size normalization. 
Microcomputed tomography  
Tendon-bone  samples  from  injury  mice  were  dissected  and  fixed  in  10%  formaldehyde  for  bone 
morphometry analysis (Fang et al., 2020). Microcomputed tomography (μCT, Bruker Skyscan 1272) with 
an energy of 55 kilovolt peaks, an intensity of 145 μA, and a standard resolution of 5 μm was used to scan 
samples. After image reconstruction, region of interest around the injury region was selected by a rectangle 
with a fixed dimension (Figure S7B). Bone volume (mm3), BMD, Tb.Th in the region of interest were 
measured directly with CTAn (Bruker). For 3D visualization, the reconstructed images were imported into 
CTVOX (Bruker).    
Histology  
Tendon-bone  samples  after  μCT  scanning  were  dissected  and  fixed  10%  formaldehyde  overnight. 
Following this, tendon-bone samples were decalcified in Buffered Versenate for two weeks. Subsequently, 
the samples were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, cyrosectioned into 10 μm-
thick slices, and stained with safranin O according to the standard protocol. All images were collected on a 
Nikon TI Eclipse inverted microscope for visualization and semi-quantified according to the table. Similarly, 
tissue sections of injured enthesis at POD7 to track the retention of Gli1-lineage cells were prepared. Tissue 
slices were counterstained with DAPI and mounted for imaging by using a Nikon TI Eclipse inverted 
microscope with a 20X and 60X oil objective discussed above.   
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Graphpad Prism 7 was used to conduct statistical analysis. Results are shown as mean±SD. For every 
experiment, both male and female mice from at least two independent litters were used. All data analysis 
were conducted blindly. When comparison was applied between two groups, an unpaired or paired (when 
appropriate) Student’s t test was used. When comparison was applied among multiple groups or two factors, 
ANOVA was performed with post hoc Tukey correction.  0.05<#p<0.1, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; 
****p < 0.0001 are shown to indicate statistically significantly difference in figures. The exact numbers of 
repeated sample for each experiment are revealed in the corresponding figure legends.
