19  Abstract 
20  The transition zone is a specialised gate at the base of cilia/flagella, which segregates the ciliary 
21  compartment from the cytoplasm and strictly regulates protein entry. In this study, we have identified 
22  CEP76  as  an  essential  germ  cell  transition  zone  protein,  involved  in  the  selective  entry  and 
23  incorporation of key proteins required for sperm function and fertility into the ciliary compartment and 
24  ultimately the sperm tail. In its absence sperm tails are shorter and immotile as a consequence of deficits 
25  in essential sperm motility proteins including DNAH2 and AKAP4, which accumulate at the sperm neck 
26  in the mutant. We demonstrate CEP76 is required for sperm tail fibrous sheath formation, outer dense 
27  fibre loading and axoneme stability in the principal piece and ultimately sperm motility. Finally, we 
28  identify that CEP76 dictates annulus positioning and composition, adding further evidence that the 
29  spermatid transition zone and annulus are part of the same functional structure.

31  Introduction 
32  Cilia and their organelle cousins, flagella, play essential roles in many cell types. Notably, a single 
33  modified motile cilium (a flagellum) projects from male gametes and is essential for fertility in sexually 
34  reproducing animals [1]. In eukaryotic cilia, the transition zone (TZ), also known as the ciliary gate, has 
35  emerged as an essential mediator of cilia development through its role in controlling protein entry into 
36  the ciliary compartment within which cilia/flagella develop [2-4]. The TZ develops immediately distal to 
37  the mature centriole, from which the core of the cilia, the axoneme, develops. The TZ allows for the 
38  selective transport of proteins into the cilium/flagellum and thus the establishment and maintenance of 
39  a unique ciliary microenvironment [5, 6]. The TZ is largely composed of sheets of Y-shaped structures 
40  that attach at one side to the developing axoneme, at a single point, and at the other side dock to the 
41  plasma membrane, at two points [7, 8]. While TZ composition, including Y-shaped linkers, is poorly 
42  understood, several genes that, when mutated, result in ciliopathies have been identified as core 
43  members of the TZ [9-12]. To enact protein and vesicle transport across the TZ and along the 
44  developing axoneme, cilia/flagella utilise a bi-directional transport process of intraflagellar transport (IFT) 
45  with the aid of the BBSome [13, 14]. In addition, the distal appendages of the centriole (known as 
46  transition fibres) play an essential role in protein trafficking into the ciliary compartment by acting as 
47  docking sites for cargoes prior to their entry through the TZ [15].

49  The sperm tail is a modified motile cilium and while it is assumed that the formation of the TZ and core 
50  of the axoneme will be similar to that which occurs in somatic cells, this is largely untested. Current 
51  models of the TZ are largely informed by data from primary cilia, or the somatic flagella of lower order 
52  species such as Chlamydomonas [16]. There is, however, emerging evidence to suggest differences in 
53  TZ structure, composition and transport machinery exist to meet the demands of different cilia/flagella 
54  sub-types (reviewed in [17]). As mammalian sperm contain accessory structures not seen in somatic 
55  cells, it is reasonable to predict that the male germ cell TZ is modified to selectively recruit fibrous sheath 
56  and outer dense fiber proteins into the ciliary lobe. 
57   
58  As with all motile cilia/flagella, sperm tail motility is dictated by the function of the axoneme – a 9+2 
59  microtubule-based structure that runs the length of the tail [18, 19]. The sperm tail is composed of two 
60  major sections: the midpiece, which houses the mitochondria; and the principal piece, wherein all 
61  glycolytic enzymes are anchored to a structure called the fibrous sheath [20-23]. Both the midpiece and 
62  principal piece compartments also contain outer dense fibres – which are circumferential to the 
63  axoneme microtubules and act to protect the sperm tail from shearing forces [24, 25]. In the principal 
64  piece, the longitudinal columns of the fibrous sheath replace the outer dense fibres 3 and 8 and are 
65  linked by circumferential ribs [26, 27]. As per the axoneme, the outer dense fibres and fibrous sheath 
66  are formed within the ciliary compartment and as such their component proteins must transition through 
67  the TZ [24]. While this may suggest the requirement of additional factors to aid in the selective transport 
68  of sperm-specific proteins via the TZ into the ciliary compartment, no such proteins of this function have 
69  been identified. 
70   
71  In addition, towards the end of sperm tail development, the annulus, a septin-based ring that is thought 
72  to be attached to, or physically a part of the TZ, migrates distally along the sperm tail to define the 
73  junction of what will ultimately become the midpiece and principal pieces of the sperm tail [28, 29]. This 
74  annulus is thought to be a diffusion barrier between the sub-compartments of the tail, and its loss is 
75  often associated with a sharp bending at the midpiece-principal piece junction, poor sperm motility and 
76  ultimately male infertility [28, 30]. At a similar time to annulus migration, but by a seemingly independent 
77  process [28, 31, 32], the membrane attached to the basal body is pulled distally to the annulus, thus 
78  exposing a portion of the axoneme (surrounded by the outer dense fibres) to the cytoplasm. This

79  process allows cytoplasmic mitochondria to be loaded onto the sperm tail to form the mitochondrial 
80  sheath of the midpiece [24, 33]. 
81   
82  Despite our descriptive understanding of a number of these processes, the mechanisms of sperm tail 
83  development are still largely unknown. It is currently unclear how sperm-specific proteins, including 
84  components  of  the  accessory  structures,  are  selectively  transported  via  the  TZ  into  the  ciliary 
85  compartment. In working to address this, we identified the previously unexplored centriole gene CEP76 
86  as being essential for male fertility in men as highlighted by a missense mutation in an infertile man with 
87  azoospermia (Figure S1; [34, 35]). CEP76 has been suggested to play a role in centriole duplication in 
88  somatic cell lines through interaction with the centriole protein CP110 [36, 37], but nothing was known 
89  about its role in male fertility. CEP76 expression is testis enriched [38] and CEP76 has been localised 
90  to centrioles in human spermatozoa and somatic cells [37, 39]. CEP76 has two putative functional 
91  domains (Figure S1): a C2 domain that is predicted to function in ciliary membrane targeting, and a 
92  transglutaminase domain that is predicted to interact with tubulins in the axoneme or the TZ [40]. It is 
93  hypothesised based on a large TZ protein comparative study, that these domains cooperate to play a 
94  role in Y-shaped linker function (Zhang and Aravind, 2012) and likely TZ function. Thus, we aimed to 
95  define the role CEP76 plays in male fertility. 
96   
97  Within this study we identify CEP76 as an essential male fertility gene, with a unique role in TZ function 
98  and the selective entry of key motility proteins into the developing flagellum. Knockout males were 
99  sterile and produced sperm with a variety of structural defects and the abnormal accumulation of key 
100  proteins at the sperm neck, consistent with an inability to pass through the TZ during the process of tail 
101  development. Consequently, formation of the mitochondrial sheath was significantly impaired in sperm 
102  from Cep76 knockouts. Collectively, these data identity CEP76 as the first known germ cell-specific 
103  regulator of transition zone function, which is required for male fertility in mammals.

108  Consistent with its putative role in male fertility, mouse Cep76 is most highly expressed in the testis 
109  (Figure S2A) with lower levels also detected in the brain. To define which germ cell types Cep76 is 
110  expressed in, we investigated its expression across the establishment of the first wave of mouse 
111  spermatogenesis (Figure S2B). Cep76 mouse testis expression levels were relatively consistent until 
112  day 18 of age, and then notably increased at day 20 of age, coincident with the beginning of 
113  spermiogenesis (first appearance of round spermatids). In agreement, single cell RNA sequencing of 
114  mouse germ cells revealed that Cep76 expression is considerably elevated in step 6-9 spermatids 
115  (Figure S2C), at the time when the core of the sperm tail is formed. We tested multiple antibodies to 
116  investigate CEP76 localisation in male germ cells but found all were non-specific (data not shown). 
117   
118  Cep76 is required for male fertility in mice 
119  To directly test the hypothesis that CEP76 is required for sperm tail development and thus male fertility, 
120  we generated a knockout mouse model using CRSIPR/Cas9 technology. We removed exon 3 of the 
121  mouse gene (Figure S1E), which resulted in a premature stop codon in exon 4 of Cep76, which 
122  produces one protein coding transcript (ENSMUST00000097542.3). This transcript encodes a protein 
123  of identical length (659 AAs, predicted molecular mass of 74.3 kDa) and 97.7% identity (Figure S1B) to 
124  the human CEP76 principal isoform. Additionally, sequence comparison revealed that the amino acid 
125  affected in the infertile man is a highly conserved residue from men to zebrafish (Figure S1B). Cep76 
126  knockout was confirmed via qPCR (Figure S1F). 
127   
128  While knockout males were free of overt systemic disease and displayed normal mating behaviour, they 
129  were sterile (Figure 1A). Knockout females were fertile (not shown). Body, testis, and epididymis 
130  weights (Figures 1B, C and D) of Cep76 knockout males were equivalent to wild type males. While the 
131  daily sperm production of Cep76 knockout males was similar to wild type counterparts (Figure 1E), the 
132  number of sperm within their epididymides was reduced to approximately 35% of wild type levels (Figure 
133  1F; p < 0.0001). The reduced sperm number in the Cep76 knockout epididymis, in the absence of a 
134  reduction in testis weight and daily sperm production was due to partial spermiation failure, as 
135  evidenced histologically in stage IX tubules, wherein sperm were retained within the seminiferous 
136  epithelium (Figure 1J). With the exception of spermiation failure, spermatogenesis appeared normal at

138  comparable between genotypes (Figures 1K and L). 
139   
140  CEP76 is required for normal sperm morphology and motility 
141  Analysis of sperm morphology via light microscopy revealed overt defects in sperm from knockout 
142  males (Figure 2A). Total sperm tail and midpiece length (measured by mitochondrial sheath length) of 
143  sperm from Cep76 knockout males was significantly shorter (by 15% and 25%, respectively) than those 
144  from wild type males (Figures 2B and C; p < 0.0001), suggesting a fundamental role of CEP76 in tail 
145  assembly within the sperm ciliary compartment that is consistent with a role in TZ function and 
146  mitochondrial loading. In agreement with the defects in sperm morphology, computer assisted sperm 
147  analysis revealed a striking reduction in the percentage of sperm from knockouts displaying basic 
148  twitching motility (Figure 2A; 6% in knockout versus 80% in wild type, p < 0.0001) and the virtual 
149  absence of forward, progressively motile sperm in comparison to wild type males (Figure 2B; 0.4% in 
150  knockout versus 42.4% in wild type, p < 0.0001). The small population of sperm from Cep76 knockout 
151  males that were classified as motile were seen to be simply twitching on the spot. 
152   
153  To examine the cause of the reduced mitochondrial sheath length in the absence CEP76, we measured 
154  the distance between the base of the sperm head and the annulus as marked by SEPT4 staining (Figure 
155  2F, G). Measurements revealed a significantly shorter distance between the annulus and nucleus in 
156  sperm from Cep76 knockout males relative to wild type (18.6 µm in knockout versus 22.6 µm in wild 
157  type; p < 0.0001). In addition, the portion of sperm with SEPT4 positive staining (Figure 2H) was 
158  significantly reduced in the absence of CEP76 (60% in knockout versus 84% in wild type, p = 0.0095), 
159  suggesting poorly formed annuli. 
160   
161  Light microscopy and a visual examination also revealed defects in sperm head shape (Figure S3A) in 
162  at least 40% of sperm from knockouts compared to 5% in wild type (p < 0.0001). We also observed a 
163  significant increase in sperm with abnormal acrosomes from Cep76 knockout males (35% in knockout 
164  versus 3% in wild type, Figure S3D; p < 0.0001). In addition, we analysed sperm head morphology 
165  using a nuclear shape analysis software. This revealed a significantly lower proportion of the knockout 
166  population classified as normal (Cluster 1), while there were significant increases in sperm with slightly

167  (Cluster 2) and largely (Cluster 4) abnormal head shapes (compared to wild type). This analysis 
168  revealed that ~70% of sperm heads from Cep76 knockout males had abnormal nuclear morphology 
169  (Figure S3E; p < 0.0001). In addition, there was a 2-fold increase in sperm decapitation in samples from 
170  knockout males, indicating that the CEP76 plays a role in establishing patency of the head-tail coupling 
171  apparatus (HTCA) (Figure S3C, p < 0.0001). 
172   
173  Collectively these results reveal CEP76 is required for the production and release of normal numbers 
174  of functional sperm. Shorter sperm tails and annulus defects suggest CEP76 plays a role in TZ function. 
175  Defects in nuclear morphology and a weakened HTCA are supportive of a role for CEP76 in manchette 
176  function and/or acrosome formation and in the fortification of the neck region (a derivative of the basal 
177  body) late in spermiogenesis. At a function level, sperm from Cep76 knockout males are unable to reach 
178  the site of fertilisation due to highly impaired sperm motility. 
179   
180  CEP76 is required for normal sperm flagella and HTCA ultrastructure 
181  In order to define the origins of the motility and structural defects, we investigated sperm ultrastructure 
182  using transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on isolated epididymal sperm 
183  (Figures 3, 4, Figure S4). At the midpiece level, the axoneme ultrastructure appeared superficially 
184  normal, bearing all outer dense fibres and the 9+2 microtubule formation with dynein arms in sperm 
185  from wild type and knockout males (Figure 3A, B, respectively). In Cep76 knockout sperm, however, a 
186  build-up of mitochondria, and membranes was seen at midpiece level cross-sections (Figure 3C). 
187  Longitudinal sperm tail sections of the midpiece from knockout males additionally revealed abnormal 
188  mitochondria with enlarged spacing within mitochondrial matrixes (Figure 3H) and notable mitochondria 
189  aggregation (Figure 3I – arrow). 
190   
191  Investigation of the axoneme ultrastructure at the principal piece level revealed absent outer dense 
192  fibres and microtubule doublets in many sperm tails from knockout males (Figure 3D-F), suggesting 
193  this compromise, which was absent at the midpiece level, may have been influenced by fibrous sheath 
194  assembly. In addition, we observed the abnormal formation of the annulus, again suggesting an origin 
195  of poor TZ formation. Specifically, in sperm from Cep76 knockout males the annulus was not clearly 
196  distinguishable from the fibrous sheath (Figure 3K), or not identifiable (Figure 3L). In addition, we

197  observed rare examples of mitochondria incorporated within the principal piece in Cep76 knockout male 
198  sperm (Figure 3K), but never in sperm from wild type controls. 
199   
200  Examination of the sperm neck region by TEM (Figure S4D-F) revealed a number of abnormal 
201  structures, including imperfect capitulum structures and a build-up of mitochondria and ectopic vesicles 
202  in sperm from Cep76 knockout males. Further, an excess of what we predicted to be granulated bodies 
203  was seen throughout the cytoplasm (Figure S4E). Granulated bodies are transported into the ciliary 
204  compartment to form the outer dense fibres which is continuous with the HTCA [42]. This finding 
205  strongly supports a role for CEP76 in the selective entry of proteins and vesicles into the ciliary 
206  compartment during spermiogenesis and, by extension, in building of the ODF and the fortification of 
207  the HTCA. Of relevance, we did not observe a significant difference in the proportion of sperm positive 
208  for SUN5 staining, a protein required for the fortification between the capitulum and basal plate [43], 
209  between genotypes, i.e., the junction with the nuclear membrane (Figure 2I; p = 0.26). As this structure 
210  is proximal to where the TZ exists, this data is consistent with a role for CEP76 in the TZ and the 
211  assembly of more distal regions of the tail. 
212   
213  CEP76 is required for the assembly of sperm tail accessory structures and annulus migration 
214  Annulus 
215  Scanning electron microscopy of sperm from Cep76 knockout males further emphasised the poorly 
216  formed annulus and accessory structures in the midpiece and principal piece (Figure 4). In sperm from 
217  wild type males, the annulus was appropriately positioned at the junction between the mitochondrial 
218  sheath of the midpiece and the fibrous sheath of the principal piece (Figure 4A, D). In sperm from Cep76 
219  knockout males, while the annulus was often associated with the fibrous sheath, it was rarely found 
220  aligned at the distal border of the mitochondrial sheath (Figure 4B, C, E, F). As a result, a region of 
221  exposed ODFs was evident between the mitochondrial sheath and the annulus or fibrous sheath. 
222  Quantification of the defects in annulus positioning (Figure 4M) revealed a normal positioning and 
223  structure of the annulus in only 10% of sperm from knockouts males compared to 95% of sperm from 
224  wild type males (p = 0.0002). Consequently, we quantified the incidence of ODF-exposed regions at 
225  the distal midpiece (Figure 4N). This revealed that ODFs were exposed in 97% of sperm from Cep76 
226  knockouts but only 10% of sperm from wild type (p = 0.0002). In many cases, the annulus was found

227  embedded within the proximal region of the fibrous sheath (e.g., Figure 4K) rather than at the junction 
228  of the midpiece, or it was not clearly observed due to large deformations in the fibrous sheath (Figure 
229  4F). Due to the predicted role of CEP76 in TZ function, we anticipate this is due to a defect in TZ/annulus 
230  migration rather than the fibrous sheath assembling too far proximally. 
231   
232  Mitochondria 
233  As above, mitochondrial packing in epididymal sperm from Cep76 knockouts was irregular and 
234  characterised by misaligned and poorly compacted mitochondria along the mitochondrial sheath (Figure 
235  4H versus 5G). Mitochondrial aggregation defects identified via TEM were confirmed via SEM and were 
236  characterised by collections of poorly formed mitochondria and a build-up around the midpiece (Figure 
237  4I). Scoring of mitochondrial sheath normality (as defined in the methods; Figure 4O) revealed a 
238  significant reduction in quality in sperm from Cep76 knockout males compared to wild type (3.5 in 
239  knockout versus 4.6 in wild type; p < 0.0001). 
240   
241  Fibrous sheath 
242  Finally, SEM revealed that fibrous sheath formation was notably impaired in the absence of CEP76 
243  (Figures 4C, F, K, L). In wild type sperm, the fibrous sheath is comprised of two longitudinal columns 
244  linked by circumferential ribs. Gaps in the fibrous sheath were evident at regular intervals (Figure 4D, 
245  J). In the absence of CEP76, however, gaps/slits between circumferential ribs were rare (Figure 4K) 
246  and in many cases the ribs appeared to be unanchored and projected from the body of the tail (Figure 
247  4L). Notably, the proximal portion of the fibrous sheath appeared to be the most disorganised (e.g., 
248  Figure 4C). Fibrous sheath normality was scored (as detailed in the methods; Figure 4P), revealed a 
249  highly significant reduction in fibrous sheath quality in sperm from Cep76 knockouts (1.6 in knockout 
250  versus 2.9 in wild type; p < 0.0001).  
251   
252  Collectively, these data reveal CEP76 is a key determinant in the development of multiple aspects of 
253  sperm tail development, including the fibrous sheath, annulus, and positioning and the mitochondrial 
254  sheath.

257  To explore the hypothesis that CEP76 is involved in the selective entry of proteins into the ciliary lobe 
258  at a molecular level, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry on sperm from the cauda epididymis 
259  of Cep76 knockout and wild type males (Table 1A). Doing so identified 32 differentially expressed 
260  proteins in sperm from knockout males (13 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated), including multiple 
261  mitochondrial and apoptotic proteins. This difference in mitochondrial protein content is consistent with 
262  the abnormal accumulation of mitochondria around the sperm tail as detailed above. In agreement with 
263  the observed reduced tail length, alpha tubulin content was significantly reduced in sperm from Cep76 
264  knockout males. In a separate analysis, and to account for differences in tail length, the content of 
265  known (or predicted) sperm tail proteins was normalised to alpha tubulin. As shown in Table 1B, 
266  following this normalisation, 14 proteins were identified as significantly altered in sperm from Cep76 
267  knockout males compared to wild type including several that are essential for sperm tail function and 
268  male fertility. They included: axonemal protein DNAH2 (1.65-fold wild type levels, p = 0.0406), the actin-
269  based motor protein myosin 9 (3.5-fold wild type levels, p = 0.0174) and AKAP3 and AKAP4, which are 
270  major components of the fibrous sheath [22] (1.36-fold and 1.46-fold wild type levels, p = 0.032 and p 
271  = 0.0498, respectively). 
272   
273  To investigate this counterintuitive increase in several motility proteins, we defined the localisation of 
274  DNAH2 and AKAP4 proteins in sperm from Cep76 knockout males using immunofluorescence (Figure 
275  5). As expected, in wild type sperm, the dynein arm protein DNAH2 was uniformly localised throughout 
276  the midpiece and principal piece of the tail (Figure 5A) [44, 45]. In contrast, while DNAH2 was found 
277  within the sperm tail in many sperm from Cep76 knockouts, it was notably accumulated in the neck 
278  region. In other sperm, DNAH2 was seen nearly exclusively localised to the neck and appeared to be 
279  almost absent from the tail (Figure 5A). Specifically, 22% of sperm from Cep76 knockout males 
280  displayed an accumulation of DNAH2 in the neck region compared to 5.1% of sperm from wild types 
281  (4.3 x wild type levels, p = 0.0006; Figure 5C). Tail pixel intensity analysis (per area) revealed a 25% 
282  reduction in DNAH2 content across the entire flagellum (p < 0.05; Figure 5E). 
283   
284  Also as expected for a component of the fibrous sheath, AKAP4 was primarily localised to the principal 
285  piece sperm from wild type (Figure 5B). As above, in Cep76 knockout sperm, AKAP4 accumulated in 
286  the neck region in 13% of sperm compared to 4% in sperm from wild type mice (Figure 5D).

287  Quantification of neck AKAP4 staining revealed 3.1-fold levels in Cep76 knockout sperm relative to wild 
288  type (Figure 5D). An analysis of pixel intensity revealed a significant, 40% reduction in AKAP4 content 
289  (per area) within the principal piece of sperm from Cep76 knockout males compared to wild type (p < 
290  0.0001; Figure 5F). 
291   
292  Collectively, these data underscore an essential role for CEP76 in TZ function and the regulated entry 
293  of key sperm tail proteins into the ciliary compartment and sperm tail development. 
294   
295  CEP76 is not required for manchette formation and migration 
296  SEM confirmed the magnitude of head deformation in sperm from Cep76 knockout males (Figure S4A-
297  C). The manchette is critically involved in shaping the proximal half of the sperm nucleus and further 
298  acts as a transport freeway for protein delivery to the basal body and into the sperm tail [24]. Despite 
299  the highly irregular sperm head shape, the formation of the manchette appeared normal in the absence 
300  of CEP76 as identified by alpha tubulin staining of isolated germ cells (not shown) and testis sections 
301  (Figure S3F). Electron microscopy reinforced that manchette structure was overtly normal (not shown).  
302   
303  CEP76 is required for the maintenance of centriole number in male germ cells 
304  CEP76 has previously been linked to a role in the suppression of centriole duplication in 293T cells [37], 
305  thus raising the possibility of a similar role in germ cells. To explore this hypothesis, we stained purified 
306  round and elongating spermatids with the centriole marker centrin (Figure S6G, H) and quantified the 
307  number of centrioles per cells (Figure S6I). As expected, two distinct centrin foci were observed in 84% 
308  of wild type spermatids and only 1% of wild type cells exhibited 3+ centrin foci. By contrast, in 
309  spermatids from Cep76 knockout males, 18% of cells possessed 3 or more centrioles structures (p = 
310  0.0002) and only 70% of cells contained 2 centrin foci (p = 0.0012). These data confirm a role for CEP76 
311  in germ cell centriole duplication suppression. Despite this finding, sperm from Cep76 knockouts 
312  contained only single tails, i.e., centriole overduplication did not lead to multiple basal bodies and 
313  axoneme growth.

316  Building a sperm tail is a complex and multistep process, requiring the coordinated action of multiple 
317  protein and organelle transport processes (reviewed in [24, 46]), and is absolutely essential for male 
318  fertility. The spermatid centriole is inherited during the process of meiosis. It subsequently duplicates 
319  and matures to give rise to the basal body that docks to both the plasma and nuclear membranes [47, 
320  48]. From this structure, the sperm tail, a modified cilium, forms through the selective entry of proteins 
321  into the ciliary compartment via the TZ that sits at the junction between the cytoplasm and the ciliary 
322  compartment. Assuming that cilia formation during germ cell development is analogous to primary cilia 
323  wherein TZ function has been studied, all component proteins for the axoneme, outer dense fibers and 
324  fibrous sheath must be selectively transported through the TZ. In this study, we establish CEP76 as the 
325  first protein shown to play a male germ cell specific role in the TZ and demonstrate that CEP76 is 
326  required for the development of functionally competent sperm. We show CEP76 is essential for the 
327  efficient transport of AKAP4 proteins into the flagella compartment, underpinning normal fibrous sheath 
328  development. We also show that it facilitates the incorporation of tubulin into the tail, and that an 
329  absence of CEP76 leads to short sperm tails. Equally, it optimises the entry of DNAH2, a core 
330  component of the axoneme motility apparatus. In the absence of CEP76, the sperm axoneme is 
331  functionally  incompetent.  Following  development  of  the  core  axoneme,  CEP76  is  required  for 
332  positioning of the annulus and thus influences mitochondrial sheath length. In addition to its TZ function, 
333  our data reveal that analogous to its roles in somatic cells [37], CEP76 plays a role in the suppression 
334  of centriole duplication in haploid male germ cells. This study highlights CEP76 as a bona fide male 
335  fertility gene in men and mice and adds to the growing evidence that several genetic factors contribute 
336  to both sperm morphology and sperm count. 
337   
338  It has recently been suggested that the annulus and TZ are part of the same ciliary structure [29] and 
339  our data support this idea. The annulus shares a number of proteins with the TZ and the localisation of 
340  several of these proteins (e.g., CEP290, MKS1) follows annulus migration during late spermiogenesis 
341  [49]. Consistent with this, the abnormal annulus structures observed in sperm from Cep76 knockout 
342  males suggests that TZ structure influences annulus structure and function. Specifically, we show that 
343  CEP76 is required for annulus positioning, and, in its absence, the annulus is poorly formed and 
344  migrates a shorter distance. Very little is known about factors that govern annulus migration and 
345  positioning [50], but these processes do not appear to be influenced by development of the fibrous

346  sheath that ultimately borders the annulus in mature spermatids but is formed prior to annulus migration. 
347  This is highlighted by data from Akap3 and Akap4 knockout mice, which exhibit poor sperm fibrous 
348  sheath development, annulus positioning and midpiece length  [20, 30, 51]. Equally, the absence of an 
349  annulus in Sept4 and 12 mutant models did not impair fibrous sheath formation [28, 32]. 
350   
351  It has been hypothesised that within CEP76 the C2 and transglutaminase domains cooperate to allow 
352  CEP76 to play a role in the transition zone as a Y-shaped linker [40]. Y-shape linker structures form the 
353  main body of the TZ; proteins of which can be grouped into the Meckel syndrome (MKS) and 
354  nephronophthisis  (NPHP)  complexes  [52].  These  complexes  participate  in  multiple  roles  during 
355  ciliogenesis – TZ attachment, core axoneme extension and then regulation of components entry into 
356  the cilia/flagella [53]. Based on domain architecture and functional predictions, CEP76 has been 
357  hypothesised to span both MKS and NPHP complexes [40]. The presence of a C2 domain in CEP76 
358  strongly suggests it anchors at the side of the Y-shaped linker interacting with the plasma membrane 
359  [40]. Our data highlight that, in vivo, CEP76 is not essential for axoneme formation, for example 
360  compared to CEP290, where CEP290 absence precludes TZ formation and ciliogenesis altogether [54, 
361  55]. Rather, data suggest that CEP76 plays a facilitative role in TZ function specifically in male germ 
362  cells and is likely not a core Y-linker component. As mice did not show symptoms of MKS or NPHP, our 
363  data reveal CEP76 is not essential for somatic cells TZ function. The possibility exists, however, that 
364  mice possessed subtle defects in somatic tissues. 
365   
366  Further, our proteomics results revealed the content of only a small number of sperm tail were altered 
367  in the absence of CEP76, supporting the hypothesis that CEP76 is highly selective in its function and 
368  that other TZ proteins are required to form a functioning sperm tail. This is consistent with the concept 
369  that TZ content is cell type-specific and that different TZ proteins are involved in the selective 
370  recruitment of precise subsets of proteins from the many thousands of proteins present with the cell 
371  cytoplasm, i.e., the TZ functions as a cell type-specific filter controlling entry into cilia. 
372   
373  Overt consequences of CEP76 loss included the abnormal assembly and content of sperm tail 
374  accessory structures. We observed inappropriate packaging of the fibrous sheath and the absence of 
375  spacing  between  the  circumferential  ribs.  AKAP4  is  the  most  abundant  fibrous  sheath  protein,

376  constituting nearly half its entire content [56], and acts as a scaffold protein for both the longitudinal 
377  columns and ribs, while AKAP3 plays a similar role in the ribs of the fibrous sheath [21, 57]. The fibrous 
378  sheath defects seen in the absence of CEP76 are consistent with the poor entry of major fibrous sheath 
379  proteins into the sperm tail compartment via the TZ. Similarly, we identified an accumulation of 
380  granulated bodies in the sperm neck region and the partial absence of outer dense fibres in the principal 
381  piece axoneme. Collectively, our results strongly suggest the deficit in the entry of fibrous sheath and 
382  outer dense fibre components into the tail compartment limited the normal formation of accessory 
383  structures and thus directly impaired sperm motility. 
384   
385  Finally, we identified significant aggregation of mitochondria and morphology in the midpiece. The 
386  mitochondrial sheath is the last accessory structure to be loaded onto the sperm tail. This occurs in 
387  parallel with the migration of the annulus and plasma membrane down to a position immediately 
388  proximal, and abutting, the principal piece, as marked by the start of the fibrous sheath, [24, 58]. 
389  Although the membrane migration occurs at the same time as annulus migration, it does not appear to 
390  be driven by the annulus as the former occurs even when the annulus does not form [28, 30]. While the 
391  annulus is not required for mitochondrial sheath formation, in its absence mitochondrial morphology is 
392  frequently abnormal [28, 31, 59]. Prior to their loading, spherical mitochondria are recruited from the 
393  cytoplasm and ordered in four columns parallel to the axoneme. They then move towards the core of 
394  the tail and  attach to the outer dense fibers, elongate, coil and stagger, to intercalate around the 
395  midpiece [58]. Next, mitochondria elongate and attach end-to-end to form a double helix around the 
396  axoneme. Cep76 knockout sperm mitochondria were largely elongated and uniform along the midpiece, 
397  suggesting that mitochondrial recruitment and early mitochondrial elongation processes proceeded 
398  normally. We predict the shorter annulus migration distance in sperm from Cep76 knockout males 
399  leaves insufficient space for the normal number of mitochondria to coil around the sperm tail, i.e. 
400  sterically  interfere  with  the  later  processes  of  mitochondrial  elongation  and  prevent  their  tight 
401  compaction within the midpiece [60]. Ultimately, the patency of the annulus to act as a barrier between 
402  major sperm tail compartments also likely influenced the loading of mitochondria, as demonstrated by 
403  examples of mitochondria in the principal piece section.

405  Our data revealed a second function of CEP76 in male germ cells – a role in supressing supernumerary 
406  centrioles, analogous to its role identified in human sarcoma cells in vitro [37]. A previously established 
407  mechanism highlighted that CEP76 controls centriole duplication via interaction with PLK1 and CP110 
408  [36, 37]. While not investigated directly here, we note Cep76 knockout mice were viable and were free 
409  of any overt body wide disease, suggesting that CEP76 is not essential for centriole function in somatic 
410  tissues. 
411   
412  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein with a germ cell-specific function in 
413  the TZ. In the absence of CEP76, essential components of the sperm tail are unable to enter the ciliary 
414  lobe, meaning less or minimal incorporation into the growing tail and thus male infertility. These data 
415  provide support for the concept that TZ composition is cell type-specific and that the TZ provides an 
416  additional layer of specificity to the composition and function of cilia and flagella.

418  Materials and methods 
419  Ethics statement 
420  Experimental procedures involving mice followed animal ethics guidelines generated by the Australian 
421  National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). All animal experiments were approved by 
422  the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (BSCI/2017/31) at Monash University, or The University 
423  of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (application 20640). 
424   
425  Knockout mouse production 
426  As described previously [34], exome sequencing of infertile men identified CEP76 as a high confidence 
427  candidate male fertility gene. The patient carried a homozygous c.607G>C (p.Gly203Arg) missense 
428  variant in a conserved residue of CEP76, which was predicted to be intolerant to variation (Figure S1). 
429  Pathogenicity assessments using SIFT and Polyphen-2 [61, 62] predicted the missense variant to affect 
430  function (SIFT) and to be possibly damaging (Polyphen). To test the requirement for CEP76 in male 
431  fertility, Cep76 knockout mice were generated on the C57BL/6J background through the Monash 
432  University Genome Modification Platform (a partner of the Australian Phenomics Network) using 
433  CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Excision of exon 3 of Cep76 was undertaken with CRISPR guide sequences 
434  targeting regions flanking exon 3: upstream – TTTAAAACTCAGTTCGTGGT and downstream –

436  truncated protein in the only protein-coding transcript of Cep76 (ENSMUST00000097542.3). Changes 
437  in gene sequence were identified with Sanger sequencing. Mice heterozygous for the Cep76 deletion 
438  were intercrossed to generate knockout individuals and wild type controls. Genotyping was performed 
439  by Transnetyx (Corvoda, USA) using the primers F – CCCATTAACAGCCTCTGCTTCATAA and R –

442  testis  cDNA  relative  to  Ppia  (primers  F  –  CAGTGCTCAGAGCTCGAAAGTTT  and  R  – 
443  ACCCTGGACATGAATCCT).

445  CEP76 species alignments 
446  CEP76 protein alignments were conducted using the protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (NCBI).

449  ENSMUSP00000095149; Danio rerio ENSDARP00000075595. We compared entire protein identity across 
450  species and focused on the conservation of amino acid 203G, which was mutated in the infertile patient 
451  (Figure S1B). 
452   
453  Analysis of Cep76 expression 
454  Whole organ RNA was extracted from adult mouse brain, epididymis, heart, liver, lung, spleen and 
455  testis, as well as testes from mice aged day 0-50, to investigate the expression of Cep76 across different 
456  tissues and throughout the establishment of the first wave of spermatogenesis. Each tissue was 
457  homogenized in TRIzol Reagent to isolate RNA, which was converted to cDNA and used for qPCR with 
458  SYBR Green master mix as previously described [63]. Primers used to detect Cep76 were F – 
459  CTCGGTCACCAGCAATGAAA and R – CAGACAGTGGTGAGGCCAAG, and housekeeping gene 
460  Ppia  are  denoted  above.  We  also  utilised  single  cell  RNA  sequencing  data  contained  within

465  Knockout males (Cep76-/-) and wild type male littermates (Cep76+/+) were aged to 10-14 weeks and 
466  their fertility was assessed using the pipeline outlined previously [64]. In brief, 5 mice of each genotype 
467  were setup to mate with 2 independent wild type females each (6-12 weeks old). The presence of a 
468  copulatory plug was recorded as an indication of successful mating. Litter sizes were recorded as the 
469  number of pups generated per plug. Males were subsequently culled and weighed (10-14 weeks of 
470  age), and one testis and epididymis were dissected and processed for histological assessment. 
471  Additional testes and epididymides were snap frozen on dry ice for calculation of daily sperm production 
472  and epididymal sperm counts as described previously [65]. In addition, sperm were collected from the 
473  cauda of the epididymis through backflushing, then resuspended in MT6 medium at 37ºC for motility 
474  assessment via computer assisted semen analysis [66]. Residual sperm were washed in PBS then 
475  dried onto SuperFrost slides overnight. Sperm were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and 
476  washed in PBS and stained with Mayer’s haematoxylin for 10 min and eosin (Amber Scientific, Midvale, 
477  Australia) for 1 min to allow an assessment of sperm morphology and tail length. Alternatively, fixed 
478  sperm were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X-100/PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia) for 10 min, 
479  washed in PBS and stained with 10 µg/ml DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, Scoresby, Australia) to allow 
480  an assessment of sperm head morphology, or 1 μg/ml peanut agglutinin conjugated to AlexaFluor-488 
481  to label the acrosome. Head morphology assessment was performed using Nuclear Morphology 
482  Analysis software version 1.17.1 [67] via an ImageJ  plugin (National Institutes of Health, USA). All 
483  length measurements (midpiece length, tail length and annulus positioning) were measured using 
484  ImageJ (version 1.52k). 
485   
486  Electron microscopy 
487  To investigate germ cell ultrastructure, testes were processed for electron microscopy as outlined 
488  previously [68]. Similarly, caudal sperm were backflushed into MT6 medium and processed for electron 
489  microscopy as outlined previously [68]. Images were taken either on a Jeol 1400 Plus electron 
490  microscope at the Vera and Clive Ramaciotti Centre for Electron Microscopy (Monash University, 
491  Australia), or a Talos L120C or a FEI Teneo VolumeScope at the Ian Holmes Imaging Center (The 
492  University of Melbourne). To view the mitochondria, annulus, and fibrous sheath structure of sperm via 
493  SEM, sperm were isolated from the cauda epididymis and incubated in 100 µl of 1 x PBS for 30 min to 
494  strip the plasma membrane then processed as outlined in [69].

495   
496  Scoring of mitochondrial sheath, fibrous sheath and annulus normality 
497  To quantify the degree of ultrastructural defects within sperm tail structures, scoring of each structure 
498  (mitochondrial sheath, fibrous sheath, and annulus) was performed on SEM images. For each biological 
499  replicate, ten sperm were assessed. Mitochondrial sheath normality was scored 1-5: 1 – missing 
500  mitochondria; 2 – many abnormally oriented and/or thick mitochondria; 3 – few abnormally oriented 
501  and/or thick mitochondria; 4 – broadly normal with very few abnormally oriented mitochondria; 5 – no 
502  defects where ‘normal’ was defined as homogeneously coiled mitochondria, with none missing, thick or 
503  abnormally oriented. Fibrous sheath normality was score from ranks 1-3: 1 – no slits and/or massive 
504  aggregation of circumferential ribs or longitudinal columns; 2 – reduced number of slits or slight 
505  aggregation; 3 – normal structure, where normal was defined as slits occurring at regular intervals and 
506  no aggregation. Annulus normality was score as: normal – intact, not shrunken, and localised to the 
507  junction  between  the  midpiece  and  principal  piece;  or  abnormal  –  small,  ectopically  placed  or 
508  unidentifiable. 
509   
510  Mass spectrometry to define sperm protein composition 
511  Sperm were backflushed from caudae epididymides of adult wild type (1 mouse per replicate, n = 3 
512  replicates) and Cep76 knockout males (2 mice per replicate due to reduction in epididymal sperm 
513  content) into MT6 medium for 15 min at 37ºC. Sperm were washed three times in 1 x Tris buffered 
514  saline, pelleted, and then stored at -80ºC. Sperm pellets were then dried in a speed vacuum and 
515  prepared for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and run on a SCIEX QTRAP6500 as 
516  described previously [70]. 
517   
518  Data were assessed as 1) total/raw spectral counts or 2) total spectral counts were normalised to the 
519  alpha tubulin content (alpha tubulin chain 8) for a comparison of sperm tail protein content in recognition 
520  of the shorter sperm tails measured from Cep76 null mice. Sperm tail proteins were identified via 
521  proteomics or localisation studies. For completeness, proteins with an unknown localisation or that are 
522  localised throughout the head and tail were included in the tail protein group. Proteins associated 
523  exclusively with the sperm head or neck and mitochondrial proteins were not included here as the

526  in Table S1. 
527   
528  Immunofluorescence and protein localisation 
529  To define centriole number in male germ cells, spermatids were isolated from the testes of males using 
530  the STAPUT method [71]. Cells were settled onto poly-L-lysine coated SuperFrost slides for 15 min and 
531  then fixed in ice cold methanol at -20 °C for a maximum of 7 min. Slides were immediately washed and 
532  rehydrated in PBS. Fixed spermatids were permeabilised in 0.2% Triton-X-100/PBS for 10 min, blocked 
533  in CAS-block (Dako), incubated overnight in 0.1 µg/ml Centrin antibody (Merck 04-1624) to stain 
534  centriole components and beta tubulin (Abcam ab21057) to stain the manchette for spermatid staging, 
535  then counterstained with DAPI. Z-stacks were taken using a Leica SP8 confocal and flattened to capture 
536  all slices in a single frame. The number of centriole components per spermatid was then counted for 
537  100 cells per replicate, per genotype. 
538   
539  To  define  the  localisation  of  a  sub-set  of  differentially  expressed  proteins,  fixed  sperm  were 
540  permeabilised  in  0.2%  Triton-X-100/PBS,  blocked  in  CAS-block,  incubated  overnight  in  primary 
541  antibodies (0.5 µg/ml DNAH2 [Invitrogen 64309], 2.5 µg/ml SEPT4 [Abcam 166788]) at 4 °C, stained 
542  with relevant fluorescent secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 h, then counterstained 
543  with DAPI. For other antibodies (2.8 µg/ml AKAP4 [ProteinTech  24986-1-AP], 0.8 µg/ml SUN5 
544  [ProteinTech 17495-1-AP]) sperm were permeabilised in 0.5% Triton-X-100/PBS. For the assessment 
545  of sperm mitochondrial sheath length, live sperm were loaded with 5 µM Mitotracker Red CMXRos in 
546  MT6 solution for 30 min as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Sperm were then washed in PBS, fixed 
547  in 4% paraformaldehyde and allowed to settle onto slides, as described above. All images were taken 
548  using cellSens software (Olympus, Notting Hill, Australia) on an Olympus BX-53 microscope (Olympus) 
549  equipped with an Olympus 392 DP80 camera or a Leica SP8 confocal. Immunofluorescence staining 
550  intensity was used as a surrogate of protein content in sperm tails. FIJI v2.1.0 was used to trace sperm 
551  tails (freehand line tool) and measure the average pixel intensity for AKAP4 and DNAH2 staining, to 
552  account for differences in tail length.

554  CEP76 localisation in testis sections, germ cells and sperm was attempted with two antibodies: Abcam 
555  ab86613 and Bethyl  #A302-326A. Both antibodies reacted with antigens in knockout tissue. 
556   
557  Statistical analysis 
558  Statistical analyses to determine significance between wild type and Cep76 knockout data were 
559  performed in Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, USA) using a student’s t-test on average data per mouse. 
560  A nested t-test was used to analyse sperm midpiece length, sperm tail length, annulus migration 
561  distance, mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath ultrastructure score, and pixel intensity analysis of 
562  protein entry in the sperm tail. In these datasets, multiple sperm were measured or assessed within a 
563  single biological replicate and each data point was used. A p value less than 0.05 was considered 
564  significant.

757  displacement of some microtubule doublets (black and white arrows, F) in knockout cells. Third row 
758  (G, H, I) – midpiece longitudinal sections highlighted abnormal mitochondrial morphology (arrows, H) 
759  and aggregation (arrow, I) in knockout cells. Bottom row (J, K, L) – longitudinal sections of the 
760  midpiece-principal piece boundary revealed abnormal annulus formation (arrows point to predicted 
761  annulus structures, K, L) and the consequential mixing of mitochondria and fibrous sheath structures in 
762  knockout cells (K). MP = midpiece, PP = principal piece, An = annulus, FS = fibrous sheath, Mito = 
763  mitochondria. Scale bars = 200 nm.

765  Figure 4. Annulus, mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath formation are impaired in the 
766  absence of CEP76. Scanning electron microscopy on membrane stripped sperm revealed defects in 
767  accessory structures in knockout sperm (B, C). MP = midpiece, An = annulus, FS = fibrous sheath. 
768  Sperm nuclei are overlayed in purple, mitochondria in red, annuli in yellow and fibrous sheaths in blue. 
769  High power images of the midpiece-principal piece boundary (D, E, F) revealed an abnormal annulus 
770  region in knockout sperm and the core axoneme being exposed (arrows). Wild type mitochondria were 
771  helically arranged with morphology normal (G), whereas mitochondria were poorly arranged (H) or 
772  aggregated (I) in knockout cells. Fibrous sheath deposition was highly abnormal in the absence of 
773  CEP76 (C, K, L) and appeared to be unanchored in knockout cells. Additionally, the slits present in wild 
774  type sperm (J, arrows) were missing from knockout cells. Scale bars = 1 µm. These defects were 
775  quantified (M-P). M. Annulus normality assessment. N. Prevalence of exposed outer dense fibres
