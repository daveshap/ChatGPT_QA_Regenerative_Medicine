1. Introduction 
Myoblast transplantation is the world’s first human gene therapy and somatic 
cell therapy that corrected the primary gene defect of Duchenne muscular dy-
strophy boys in year 1990 [1]. It has great social and economic value [2] [3], 
considering its potential application in treating fatal and debilitating hereditary 
diseases such as muscular dystrophies [4] [5], cardiomyopathies [5] [6] [7] [8] 
[9], Type-II diabetes [5] [10] [11], and cancer of human beings.

Skeletal myoblasts have a unique ability to fuse. Implanted myoblasts natural-
ly fuse among themselves to form genetically normal myofibers to replenish 
dead fibers [1] [5] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]. They also fuse with dystrophic [1] [5], 
diabetic [5] [10] [11] skeletal myofibers, and ischemic cardiomyoctytes [12] [13], 
inserting their nuclei that carry the normal genome to produce genetic comple-
mentation repair. It is in this unique ability of natural cell fusion that we discov-
ered four mechanisms of cancer inhibition with myoblasts.    
In the 500 million years of vertebrate evolution, especially during the 160 mil-
lion years of mammalian divergence of placental and marsupial [14], the skeletal 
muscle, being externally located in the body, has developed specific characteris-
tics for frontline defense against predation including carcinogens. Despite the 
involvement of most differentiated cell types in the human body, reports of pri-
mary or metastatic tumors in cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscles have been 
rare. This led us to believe that the myogenic cells might have developed certain 
mechanism(s) to defy carcinogenic insults in the course of evolution. Apart from 
radiation, chemo and cell therapies of human invention over the past 120 years 
that are largely inadequate, we now present an out-of-the-box approach, utiliz-
ing the natural and unique phenomena of myoblast cell fusion and the release of 
cancer-killing factors that have developed over 160 million years of placental 
evolution.   
The discovery of a muscle development promotion factor called cachectin or 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [15] [16] in muscle prompted us to test the ef-
fect of human myogenic cells on cancer cells, initially using myoblasts as they 
are muscle precursors. The myoblasts were obtained from primary culture of sa-
tellite cells isolated from muscle biopsies of male volunteer donors devoid of 
blood-borne pathogens, after obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) ap-
proval and Donor Inform Consent [1] [17] [18].  
In year 1995, Law disclosed the results of co-cultures of normal human myo- 
blasts and malignant melanoma (CRL6322) cells [19]. After 5 days culturing in 
the myoblast fusion medium, melanoma cells became spherical, apoptotic and 
detached from the collagen surface, whereas myoblasts either began to fuse or 
had already fused to become myotubes. At 10 to 19 days in myoblast fusion me-
dium, numerous dead melanoma cells were floating on the culture medium sur-
face. Myoblasts and myotubes were developing vigorously on the collagen. Sig-
nificantly more myotubes were observed after 19 days in the myoblast fusion 
medium when myoblasts and melanoma cells were seeded initially at 3:1 con-
centration ratio. Whereas the myoblasts undergoing cell fusion and the new-
ly-formed myotubes appeared to have induced cancer cell apoptosis, they were 
not able to have completely extinguished the cancer cells in culture [19]. 
The switching from culture medium to fusion medium constituted a condi-
tion of serum restriction because the fusion medium contained only one-fifth of 
the serum concentration as in the culture medium. Serum restriction terminated 
the mitotic cycle of the myoblasts, and initiated the developmental process of 
natural cell fusion towards myotube formation. Law envisioned that myoblast 
2

fusion was associated with membrane breakage with significant amount of TNF- 
α and possibly other cancer killing factors being released. Furthermore, myoblast 
fusion resulted in myotube formation and development, quickly depriving the 
melanoma cells of oxygen and nutrients within the confined microenvironment 
of the tumor capsule. These two mechanisms were considered to be responsible 
for the melanoma cell death in the co-culture studies [19].   
TNF-α is an endogenous muscle factor promoting myogenesis through activa-
tion of the p38α and Pax7 pathway [20]. TNF-α mRNA basal level in C2C12 
myoblasts had been shown up-regulated 273% by serum restriction [21]. TNF-α 
synthesis and secretion in muscle [22] [23] showed marked increases upon stre-
nuous exercise [23] [24]. By activating the JNK pathway, it triggers cancer apop- 
tosis through a caspase 3 dependent pathway [25]. 
In 2013, Stolting et al. reported that myoblasts restricted prostate cancer 
growth and metastasis by paracrine TNF-α secretion. An increase up to 25 fold 
of TNF-α mRNA basal level was demonstrated when myoblasts were co-cultured 
with tumor cells. Co-culture experiments revealed induction of cell cycle arrest, 
tumor death by apoptosis and increased myoblast differentiation. This effect was 
largely blocked by TNF-α inhibition. The same outcome was noted in nude 
mice, in which co-injected human myoblasts inhibited the tumor growth and 
lymph node metastasis of all prostate cancer cell lines evaluated [26]. 
Based on the above information, we initiated a series of animal experimenta-
tion leading to a clinical study testing the feasibility, safety and preliminary effi-
cacy of implantation of allogeneic human myoblasts into solid tumors of cancer 
patients as follows. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Manufacture of Human Myoblasts 
2.1.1. Muscle Donors 
Upon approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Cell Therapy In-
stitute and the signing of the Donor Informed Consent, muscle donors were 
admitted after meeting the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. They were male vo-
lunteers between the ages of 13 and 27. They were certified by a physician as be-
ing in good health, having normal levels of aspartateaminotransferase (AST), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), or lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and tested negative 
for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), 
hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis (RPR), and cytomegalovirus (CMV-IgM). They also 
received the following tests: Chem 24, CBC, and physical examination with nor- 
mal results. Donors were excluded if they had any chronic or infectious diseases, 
or were allergic to the local anesthetic Lidocaine.  
2.1.2. Muscle Biopsy 
About 2 grams of muscle were removed from the quadriceps muscle using an 
open biopsy technique under local anesthetic (Lidocaine) in a sterile field of a 
surgical suite of a hospital. The donor site was sutured and bandaged. No 
prophylactic antibiotic was used. The donor was discharged after recovery from

the surgical procedure to be followed by his physician if infection occurred.  
2.1.3. Preparation of Myoblasts 
Biopsy specimen obtained was processed immediately using sterile techniques 
meeting CFDA approved GMP and ISO 9001 standards. Myoblasts were cul-
tured in growth medium and incubated in 35˚C - 37˚C and 7% CO  as previous-
2
ly described [17] [18]. Myoblasts were frozen at different stages so the time al-
lotted for culturing could be coordinated with a scheduled transplant. The 
amount of cells frozen and the number of samples were documented. One test 
vial was reserved in liquid nitrogen for each biopsy. 
Random samples of the myoblasts were tested for their ability to divide, fuse, 
and form myotubes [17]. Lot release testing consisted of sterility, endotoxin, 
mycoplasma, and testing for myoblast identity, purity, potency, viability, and cell 
count on a pooled sample prior to transplant meeting quality control standards 
[17]. A retain sample of myoblasts was frozen in liquid nitrogen from each 
transplant.  
2.2. Animal Studies 
To determine biologic dosing and pharmacokinetics, nude mice were used to 
test the effect of human myoblasts on the proliferation and apoptosis of non- 
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells, and of human gastrointestinal cancer 
cells SGC-7901 in subcutaneous solid tumors. In addition, human myoblasts 
were injected into tumors having Ehrlich ascites cells (BS344 EAC) in KM mice 
to determine if such intervention might prolong the life-spans of the cancer in-
flicted mice.  
Male BALB/c nude mice averaging 17 ± 1 g were obtained from Beijing Wi-
tung Lihua Limited Co. SCXK (Beijing) 2008-0005. Male KM mice averaging 20 ± 
2 g were obtained from Hubei Animal Experimentation Center SCXK (Wuhan) 
2014-0007. Mice were maintained in compliant with SPF standards. NSCLC and 
EAC were supplied by the Alfie Inc., Wuhan. Six animal studies were conducted 
as listed in Table 1. 
2.2.1. Study 1  
Involved 20 nude mice injected subcutaneously on each side of the back with 0.2 
mL of A549 NSCLC cells at a concentration of 25 million/ml. After 18 to 20 days 
when the tumors reached 250 - 300 mm3 in volume and had developed capillary 
network of their own, 0.2 ml of saline was injected into the left tumor and 0.2 ml 
of human myoblasts into the right tumor at a low concentration of 10 million/ml 
of saline. 
The length and width of control and test tumors were measured every week 
using a caliper. The volume was calculated using the formula: (length × 
width2)/2. At 3 weeks after myoblast treatment, mice were sacrificed and the 
tumors dissected out and weighted. Student’s t-tests demonstrated significant 
difference at P < 0.05 between the mean volumes (2687.8 ± 713.4 mm3 vs. 2133.7 ± 
638.3 mm3) and weights (3.12 ± 0.88 g vs. 2.48 ± 0.78 g) of control versus myob-

last-treated tumors (Table 2). Study 1 demonstrated that injection of allogeneic 
human myoblasts into solid tumor of nude mice inhibited mature lung cancer 
growth, reducing tumor volume and weight by 20.6% and 20.5% respectively, 
despite the use of low dosage of 2 million human myoblasts at a low concentra-
tion of 10 million/ml. 
2.2.2. Studies 2 to 5 
Consisted of four groups of nude mice aged 4 to 5 week old that had previously 
received subcutaneous injections of GI SGC-7901 cancer cells on the back and 
had developed mature tumors of similar sizes on both sides measuring approx-
imately 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 cm. These dose-escalation studies were designed to study 
the pharmacokinetics of myoblasts to determine the safety and efficacy of treat-
ing gastrointestinal cancer using different myoblast concentrations and proce-
dures.  
For example, Studies 2 and 5 involved single-time injections of 6 and 28 mil-
lion myoblasts with follow-up periods of 5 and 9 days respectively. Studies 3 and 
4 involved two-time injections of 12 and 20 million myoblasts with follow-up 
periods of 19 and 9 days respectively.  
In these studies, comparison was made between myoblasts-injected tumors 
versus control tumors that received similar volume of carrier solution, in terms 
of tumor size and cancer cell number as revealed by histology of tumor sections

Figure 1. Intra-tumor Myoblast Injection Inhibited Cancer Pro-
liferation and Tumor Growth in Two Representative Lung Can-
cer-inflicted Nude Mice. (A) On Day 1, injection of 2 × 106 allo-
geneic human myoblasts into test tumors (top) led to relative in-
creases in tumor sizes until Day 8 as compared to control tumors 
receiving saline (bottom). This is because of myotube formation 
within the first week of myoblast transplant [27]. Significant re-
duction in volumes of test tumors was observed in Day 13 as 
compared to controls. Whereas test tumors decreased in size 
from Day 8 to Day 13, control tumors showed significant in-
creases in sizes. Additional implantation of 10 × 106 myoblasts on 
Day 15 boosted the volumes of the test tumors. (B) Administra-
tion of the myoblast regime in Study 3 using a total of 12 × 106 
myoblasts reduced the volume of the test tumor (right) to about 
50% of the control (left) after 19 days. 
 
using H&E stain. 
Figure 1(A) showed two representative mice from Study 3 each had received 
2 million myoblasts in 0.15 ml for the initial 15 days followed by a second injec-
tion of 10 million myoblasts in 0.15 ml on day 15. The mice were sacrificed on 
day 19, and representative control and myoblast-treated tumors were shown in 
Figure 1(B). Myoblast injection had inhibited cancer proliferation and reduced 
the volume of the tumor to about 50% of the control. 
Histologic study demonstrated spindle-shaped myoblasts and myotubes 
amidst round tumor cells in the myoblast-treated tumors (Figure 2(A), Figure 
2(B)). Abundant cancer cell death appeared as empty space or vacuoles in the 
tumor sections. As usual, sections of control tumors are compact with tumor 
cells (Figure 2(C)). Newly-formed myotubes, unable to become innervated and 
vascularized inside the tumor capsule, had perished, leaving empty space and 
vacuoles also. Myoblasts immuno-stained brownish with human desmin were

treated tumors (Figure 2(D)), but not in sections of control tumors. 
Study 2 to 5 established the safe and effective dose range and optimal phar-
macokinetics of the allogeneic human myoblasts in treating mature gastrointes-
tinal cancer using different myoblast concentrations and procedures. Doses of 2 
to 28 million myoblasts administered at 13.3 million/ml to 186.7 million/ml re-
spectively were found to be safe and effective in reducing tumor volume, weight 
and cancer cell number. The surprising discovery of myoblasts wrapping around 
the cancer cells in sections of the myoblast-treated tumors (Figure 2(D)) sug-
gested a fourth mechanism of cancer cell apoptosis, namely that the myoblasts 
prevented the cancer cells from metastasis, and continued to exert detrimental 
effects on them. 
2.2.3. Study 6 
Involved 21 KM mice injected intraperitoneal with 20 million Ehrlich ascites 
cellseach and randomized into test (11 mice) and control (10 mice) groups. One 
day later, control mice each received intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of saline, 
whereas test mice each received 0.2 ml containing 50 million human myoblasts. 
The mean survival period after cancer implantation for the control mice was 
15.4 ± 1.5 days, significantly less than that for the myoblast-injected mice of 18.6 ± 
3.2 days at P < 0.005 by Student’s t-test. Study 6 demonstrated that 50 million 
allogeneic human myoblasts administered at a high concentration of 250 mil-

lion/ml could extend the lifespan of mice inflicted with immature Ehrlich ascites 
cells by 20.8%. 
3. Postulated Mechanisms of Cancer Cell Apoptosis 
Four mechanisms were considered to be responsible for inhibition of cancer cell 
proliferation, tumor volume reduction and cancer cell apoptosis:  
1) The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) released following cell membrane 
breakage in the processes of myoblast mitosis and cell fusion killed cancer cells 
(Figure 3(A));  
2) Dividing myoblasts and newly developed myotubes competed successfully 
and had taken away most if not all of the nutrients and oxygen inside the tumor 
from the cancer cells (Figure 3(B));  
3) Injection trauma of allogeneic myoblasts mounted local inflammatory and 
immunologic attacks on both myoblasts and cancer cells (Figure 3(C)); and   
4) Myoblasts wrapped around cancer cells, preventing them from metastasis, 
and continued to exert detrimental effects on them (Figure 2(D)). 
4. Basis to Initiate Clinical Trial 
Results of co-culture and animal studies supported the hypothesis that mitotic or 
fusing human myoblasts and newly formed myotubes were potent biologics to  
 
 
Figure 3. Initially, three mechanisms were considered to be responsible for inhibition of 
cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell apoptosis: (A) tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
released following cell membrane breakage during myoblast mitosis and cell fusion killed 
cancer cells; (B) dividing myoblasts and newly developed myotubes competed successful-
ly and had taken away most if not all of the nutrients and oxygen inside the tumor from 
the cancer cells; (C) injection trauma of allogeneic myoblasts mounted local inflammato-
ry and immunologic attacks on both myoblasts and cancer cells.

inhibit cancer cell proliferation, killing cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth. 
Considering that our terminal cancer subjects had no immediate effective alter-
native, and the demonstrated safety of myoblast treatment of patients suffering 
muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and Type II diabetes, benefit versus risk 
ratio would favor proceeding onto clinical studies with cancer patients. 
5. Clinical Trial 
In China, cell transplantation is considered as a medical treatment technology 
and has been regulated not by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration 
(CFDA) but by the National Ministry of Health, now called the National Health 
and Family Planning Commission. As of July 2, 2015 the Commission abolished 
the necessity to gain approval at the national level for somatic cell transplanta-
tion to initiate clinical trials, except for stem cells. Such human studies, however, 
have to be approved by a Grade 3A hospital that would take on the responsibility 
of patient safety and register such studies with the Health and Family Planning 
Commission at the provincial level [28]. The CFDA still has to approve the plant 
of cell manufacture. 
The use of allogeneic human myoblasts as a biologic in clinical studies was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Third Affiliated Hos-
pital of Xinxiang Medical University in Henan, China. 
Three volunteer cancer patients, aged between 55 and 80, were admitted after 
meeting the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and signing of Patient Informed 
Consent. They were certified by a physician as being in good health, having 
normal levels of AST, ALT, or LD, and tested negative for human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), hepatitis C (HCV), sy-
philis (RPR), and cytomegalovirus (CMV-IgM). They also received the following 
tests: Chem 24, CBC, and physical examination with normal results. Subjects 
were excluded if they had any infectious diseases. 
Being the world’s first, this clinical trial proceeded with great caution, ex-
amining the safety and efficacy of precision implantation of allogeneic human 
myoblasts into solid tumors of three patients having lung, liver and gastrointes-
tinal cancers respectively. 
5.1. Case 1   
Yang XX, female, aged 62, had history of lung cancer metastasized into the brain 
and the left adrenal gland. Her brain metastasis was treated previously with rad-
iation therapy and chemotherapy for 3 weeks without remission.   
The subject underwent allogeneic human myoblast implantation into the 
adrenal metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung on September 10, 2015. MRI 
showed the tumor from 49.50 mm in its maximum length measured at one 
month before (Figure 4(A)) developing to 52.50 mm at the time of myoblast 
implantation. Implantation was guided with a General Electric (GE) Vivid E9 
Color Doppler Ultrasound after piercing with a needle through the abdominal 
cavity. About 1 billion allogeneic myoblasts at a concentration of 100 million/ml

Figure 4. (A) MRI showed the adrenal metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung meas-
ured 49.50 mm in its maximum length at one month before implantation. (B) About 1 
billion allogeneic myoblasts at a concentration of 100 million per ml of patient’s own se-
rum were injected into one side (light) of an oblong solid tumor measuring over 52 mm 
in length. The outline of the adrenal metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung is traced 
in red. The other side (dark) of the tumor was not injected and served as a control. (C) At 
2 months after myoblast implantation, the tumor size decreased, measuring 45.86 mm in 
length. A second implantation was administered at 2.5 months after the first. (D) The de-
crease in tumor size continued until 9 months after the first implantation, with the tumor 
length being measured at 40.72 mm. 
 
of the patient’s own serum [29] were injected into one side of the oblong solid 
tumor. The other side of the tumor was not injected and served as a control 
(Figure 4(B)).  
Some adverse reactions were observed, treated and remised in 10 days. These 
included temporary reduction in blood pressure down to 82/50 mmHg, cough-
ing, phlegm sputum and headache. 
The abdomen was examined with MRI (Siemens, Magnetum-ESSENZA) be-
fore and after myoblast implantation, comparing tumor size and density through 
signals obtained from test and control areas. Examining methods included Axi: 
IN-PHASE, OPP-PHASE, TSE T2WI/FS, DWI and Cor: TRUFI, T2WI. 
At 2 months after myoblast implantation, the tumor size decreased, measur-
ing 45.86 mm in length (Figure 4(C)). A second implantation of 1.4 billion al-
logeneic myoblasts was administered at approximately 120 million/ml on No-
vember 26, 2016 with the hope to further interrupt cancer proliferation and to 
induce cancer apoptosis. The patient suffered no adverse reaction. The tumor 
length decreased to 40.72 mm at 9 months after the first implantation (Figure 
4(D)).

TIF-1 (+), Vimentin (−), CK (pan) (−), CK7 (−), CK19 (−), SyN (+), CgA (+), 
Ki-67 (+, 40%). Histologic examination demonstrated that the non-injected por-
tion of the carcinoma was densely packed with cancer cells (Figure 5(A)). Large 
scale of cancer cell death was apparent in the myoblast-injected portion of the 
tumor (Figure 5(B)). 
5.2. Case 2 
Wang, XX, male, aged 67, previously diagnosed with cardiac malfunction and 
primary  liver  cancer  having  multiple  tumors,  underwent  allogeneic  human 
myoblast implantation on September 10, 2015. About 700 million myoblasts at a 
concentration of 100 million/ml of patient’s own serum was injected into a solid 
tumor measuring 35.2 mm × 25.2 mm (Figure 6(A)). Implantation was guided 
with a General Electric (GE) Vivid E9 Color Doppler Ultrasound after piercing 
with a needle through the upper abdominal cavity and the right anterior wing of 
the liver where the treated tumor was located. Another tumor in the right post-
erior wing of the liver, measuring 28.9 mm × 25.4 mm × 26.7 mm, was left un-
touched to serve as control (Figure 6(E)). 
The upper abdomen was examined with MRI (Siemens, Magnetum-ESSENZA) 
at 1 month after myoblast implantation, comparing tumor size and density

MRI demonstrated that the myoblast-injected upper tumor significantly de-
creased in size and density with time (Figures 6(A)-(D)), whereas the non-in- 
jected control lower tumor in the same liver increased in size (Figure 6(E), Fig-
ure 6(F)). This indicated that the implanted myoblasts and developing myo-
tubes interrupted cancer proliferation and induced cancer apoptosis. 
At 1 month after myoblast implantation, the myoblast-injected tumor was 
punctured and two needle biopsies were obtained measuring 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm 
in length respectively. Pathology demonstrated nodular connective tissue being 
distributed among sclerotic liver tissue. No cancerous tissue was observed (Fig- 
ure 5(C)), indicating that the implanted myoblasts and developing myotubes 
had interrupted cancer proliferation and induced cancer apoptosis.

the abdominal wall and the lymph node posterior to the diaphragm. Immuno-
pathology demonstrated CEA (+), Villin (+), CK19 (+), CK7 (+/−), CK20 (−), 
Ki-67 (+, 30%), CKpan (+). Surgical removal and chemotherapy did not result in 
remission of the cancer.  
On December 23, 2015, the subject underwent allogeneic human myoblast 
implantation into the metastasized tumor on the abdominal wall measuring 41.5 × 
16.9 mm, and into the metastasized tumor in the lymph node measuring 29.0 × 
23.0 mm. About 400 million myoblasts at a concentration of 100 million/ml of 
patient’s own serum were injected into each tumor without any adverse reaction.  
At 1 month after myoblast implantation, there was a slight reduction in tumor 
sizes measuring 29.0 × 23.0 mm and 19.0 × 12.0 mm respectively. Histology of 
the abdominal tumor showed cancer cell scarcity with the presence of myotubes 
(Figure 5(D)). 
As of March 11, 2017 when this manuscript was submitted, all the myob-
last-treated patients were alive and well. 
6. Discussion 
Cumulated results from co-culture studies, animal experimentation and clinical 
trial provided confirmatory evidence to indicate that myoblasts and developing 
myotubes, either singly or in combination, were potent biologics that inhibited 
tumor growth and induced cancer cell apoptosis.  
Direct injection of allogeneic (or even autologous) human myoblasts at 100 
million per milliliter of host serum into the solid tumor without immunosup-
pressant was preferred, though myoblast concentration might vary from 75 mil-
lion to 250 million per milliliter.  
Exposing the allogeneic myoblasts to 100% host serum primed the myoblasts 
for proliferation. Implantation of this mixture into the tumor constituted serum 
restriction, a condition that terminated mitosis and induced cell fusion to occur.  
Myoblasts’ unique characteristic shared only with cardiac and smooth muscle 
cells was natural cell fusion through which myoblasts at the end of their mitotic 
cycle underwent cell membrane breakage, releasing large but naturalquantity of 
cancer-killing TNF-α and possibly other TNFs into the microenvironment. The 
second phase of cell fusion was accomplished by massive sarcolemma formation, 
enclosing two hundred to five hundred myoblast nuclei into one myotube. 
Competition for nutrients and oxygen against cancer cells within the tightly en-
capsulated tumor was fierce resulting in death of cancer and myogenic cells. 
Each of the myotube had to be vascularized and innervated to survive, failing 
which the myotubes would disappear, leaving vacuoles and empty spaces within 
shrunken tumors. Furthermore, allogeneic myoblast implantation triggered in-
flammation and local immune response, killing myoblasts and cancer cells indi-
scriminately. Cancer cells also became non-metastatic as being “wrapped” with 
myoblasts immuno-stained brownish with desmin. 
7. Conclusion 
This is the first report to have documented plausible mechanisms and the use of

precision implantation of intra-tumor myoblast implantation to treat solid tu-
mors in cancer patients. The safety and efficacy that it demonstrated, though 
preliminary, lead the way to developing a potential new treatment for cancer. 
Lacking graft-versus-host damage, myoblasts and developing myotubes are safe 
biologics. Obviously the benefit versus risks ratio will favor well designed clinical 
trials to be conducted at their earliest, including randomized, double-blind stu-
dies.
