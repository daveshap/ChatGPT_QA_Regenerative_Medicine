ABSTRACT 
 
Loss of cell polarity and tissue disorganization occurs in majority of epithelial cancers. Studies in simple 
model organisms identified molecular mechanisms responsible for the establishment and maintenance 
of cellular polarity, which play a pivotal role in establishing proper tissue architecture. The exact role of 
these cell polarity pathways in mammalian cancer is not completely understood. Here we analyzed the 
mammalian orthologs of drosophila apical-basal polarity gene lethal giant larvae (lgl), which regulates 
asymmetric stem cell division and functions as a tumor suppressor in flies. There are two mammalian 
orthologs of lgl (Llgl1 and Llgl2). To determine the role of the entire lgl signaling pathway in mammals 
we generated mice with ablation of both Llgl1 and Llgl2 in skin epidermis using K14-Cre (Llgl1/2-/- cKO 
mice). Surprisingly, we found that ablation of Llgl1/2 genes does not impact epidermal polarity in adult 
mice. However, old Llgl1/2 cKO mice present with focal skin lesions which are missing epidermal layer 
and ripe with inflammation. To determine the role of lgl signaling pathway in cancer we generated Trp53-
/-/Llgl1/2-/- cKO and Trp53-/+/Llgl1/2-/- cKO mice. Loss of Llgl1/2 promoted squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) development in Trp53-/- cKO and caused SCC in Trp53-/+ cKO mice, while no cancer was 
observed in Trp53-/+ cKO controls. Mechanistically, we show that ablation of Llgl1/2 causes activation 
of aPKC and upregulation of NF-kB signaling pathway, which may be necessary for SCC in Trp53-
/+/Llgl1/2-/- cKO mice.  We conclude that Lgl signaling pathway functions as a tumor suppressor in 
mammalian skin epidermis.

INTRODUCTION 
Due to the extraordinary progress in cancer research, significant information was acquired about the 
genetic modifications in human cancer. However, the early cellular events that trigger cancer are not 
well understood. It is likely that the defective asymmetric cell divisions of stem or progenitor cells are 
ultimately responsible for the accumulation of dividing cells that do not withdraw from the cell cycle and 
form a tumor (Bajaj et al. 2015). The process of normal asymmetric cell division of stem cells is 
responsible for formation of two daughter cells with different cell fates (Horvitz and Herskowitz 1992; 
Knoblich 2010). One cell continues to be a stem cell while the other cell undergoes differentiation and 
eventually withdraws from the cell cycle. It is plausible that the failure of proper asymmetric cell division 
transforms normal stem cell into a cancer stem cell that can cause tumor formation. To understand 
such  earlier  cancer  initiation  events,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the  mechanisms  regulating 
asymmetric cell divisions and what happens to these mechanisms in cells that acquired genetic 
alterations that ultimately result in cancer development.  
Most of the knowledge about the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division comes from studies on simple 
model organisms. Drosophila gene lethal (2) giant larvae (lgl) plays a critical role in asymmetric cell 
division of neuroblasts (Vasioukhin 2006). L(2)gl mutant flies show a dramatic cancer-like phenotype 
(Bilder et al. 2000). The brain and imaginal discs of l(2)gl larvae expand and the giant larvae dies (thus 
the name – lethal giant larvae) (De Lorenzo et al. 1999). Lgl functions in asymmetric cell division as a 
cell polarity protein, which is necessary for polarization of neuroblasts before cell division. Lgl regulates 
cell polarity by promoting the identity of the lateral and basal membrane domains and inhibiting the 
function of the Par6-Par3 (Bazooka)-aPKC and Crumbs-Stardust-Patj protein complexes responsible 
for the maintenance of the apical membrane domain (Bilder et al. 2000; Bilder et al. 2003; Tanentzapf 
and Tepass 2003). During neuroblasts division, apically localized Par3/6-aPKC-Pins- Ga/bg-Inscutable 
proteins orient the mitotic spindle and segregate the cell fate determinants Numb, Prospero and Brat 
to the basal cortex. After the division, cell fate determinants are present in only one daughter cell, which 
starts the differentiation program. Lgl is the principal downstream phosphorylation target of apical aPKC 
and mitotic Aurora A protein kinases (Betschinger et al. 2003; Rolls et al. 2003; Bell et al. 2015; 
Carvalho et al. 2015). aPKC and Aurora A phosphorylate Lgl and this phosphorylation releases Lgl 
from  its  association  with  membranes  and  actin  cytoskeleton  (Dong  et  al.  2015).  In  lgl  mutant 
neuroblasts the cell fate determinants are not localizing basally and they are inherited by both daughter 
cells (Ohshiro et al. 2000; Peng et al. 2000). Lgl mutant neuroblasts and their progeny lose their ability 
to differentiate and continue to proliferate (Woods and Bryant 1989). This results in massive hyperplasia 
in the brain of zygotic lgl mutant flies (Gateff and Schneiderman 1969).  
The mechanisms responsible for lgl function in Drosophila are complex and not completely understood. 
In Drosophila neuroblasts, loss of lgl results in increased activity of aPKC, which is necessary and 
sufficient for hyperplasia (Rolls et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2006). There is significant evidence that lgl is 
necessary for the regulation of the tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway and the Hippo effector Yorkie 
(Yap1 ortholog) is hyperactive in lgl-mutant flies (Grzeschik et al. 2010; Parsons et al. 2010; Enomoto 
and Igaki 2011; Jukam and Desplan 2011; Parsons et al. 2014a). In addition, Drosophila lgl negatively 
regulates Notch and JNK signaling (Sun and Irvine 2011; Parsons et al. 2014b). It is necessary for the 
appropriate cargo sorting into the retromer pathway (de Vreede et al. 2014), and endosomal vesicle 
acidification (Portela et al. 2018). Recent RNAi kinome screen in Drosophila not only confirmed the

connection between lgl and aPKC, Hippo, Notch and JNK, but also identified genetic interactions 
between lgl and Dpp, Wg, Hh, Src, Ras, and PI3K signaling pathways, indicating that lgl-mediated 
tumor  suppressive  mechanisms  in  Drosophila  can  be  very  complex  and  cell  context  dependent 
(Parsons et al. 2017).  
There are two mammalian orthologs of Drosophila lgl gene, Llgl1 and Llgl2, which are expressed in 
largely overlapping pattern (Klezovitch et al. 2004). The expression of LLGL1/2 proteins is lost in variety 
of human cancers including gastric cancer (Nam et al. 2014), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Matsuzaki 
et al. 2015), hepatocellular carcinoma (Lu et al. 2009), glioma (Liu et al. 2015), endometrial cancer 
(Tsuruga et al. 2007), and melanoma (Kuphal et al. 2006). Re-expression of LLGL proteins in cancer 
cell  lines  that  lost  endogenous  LLGL1/2  results  in  decreased  cell  proliferation  and  survival  and 
increased differentiation (Schimanski et al. 2005; Kuphal et al. 2006; Kashyap et al. 2013; Gont et al. 
2014; Greenwood et al. 2016). Interestingly, in human glioblastoma cells LLGL1 is a critical regulator 
of self-renewal and differentiation that functions downstream from PTEN (Gont et al. 2013). In these 
cells, absence of PTEN promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation, and the mechanisms involve 
activation of aPKC and inhibition of LLGL1 by aPKC-mediated phosphorylation (Gont et al. 2013; Gont 
et al. 2014). Expression of mutant LLGL1 (LLGL1- SA) that cannot be phosphorylated by aPKC 
completely erases the PTEN-loss-mediated self-renewal and differentiation phenotypes (Gont et al. 
2013; Gont et al. 2014). In oligodendrocyte progenitors, Llgl1 regulates differentiation and cooperates 
with Ink4a/Arf in transformation and gliomagenesis (Daynac et al. 2018). We have previously used 
mouse genetic approach to determine the role of Llgl1 and Llgl2 genes in mammalian organism in vivo. 
We found that mice with null mutation of Llgl2 display attenuated placental branching morphogenesis 
but show no obvious adult phenotypes (Sripathy et al. 2011). In contrast, mice with germline ablation 
of Llgl1 display prominent disorganization of the developing brain and die within few hours after birth 
from severe hydrocephalus (Klezovitch et al. 2004). Conditional deletion of Llgl1 in embryonic brain 
revealed a connection between Llgl1 and accumulation of N-cadherin at the apical junctional complexes 
(Jossin  et  al.  2017).  The  loss  of  Llgl1  resulted  in  disruption  of  epithelial  adhesion  and  brain 
malformation; however, no cancer was observed in these animals (Jossin et al. 2017). Since Llgl1 and 
Llgl2 are very similar to each other, we hypothesized that these genes may display genetic redundancy 
in mice organisms and the ablation of both genes in the same tissue is necessary to reveal the role of 
the LGL pathway in mammals. We have now generated the conditional double mutant Llgl1/2 mice and 
this approach revealed tumor suppressive role of Llgl1/2 in mammalian skin epidermis.  
 
RESULTS 
Generation of epidermis–specific double mutant Llgl1/Llgl2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice 
(K14-Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl).  
We have previously generated mice with a null mutation of Llgl1 and found that this mutation results in 
 
neonatal lethal phenotype (Klezovitch et al. 2004). Llgl1-/- pups develop disorganization of brain 
architecture; however, the phenotype is confined to brain because it is the only embryonic tissue that 
does not express Llgl2 (Klezovitch et al. 2004). Our work on Llgl2 mutant mice revealed viability and 
fertility of straight Llgl2 knockout mice, presumably due to compensatory expression of Llgl1 in all 
tissues (Sripathy et al. 2011). We reasoned that to understand the role of the entire Lgl signaling

pathway in cancer we need to generate mice with Cre-inducible tissue-specific conditional double 
knockout of Llgl1 and Llgl2. Our previously published Llgl2 knockout mice were made using Llgl2 allele 
gene trapped with vector pGT0lxf (Sanger Institute), which reverts to wild-type phenotype upon Cre 
recombination. Thus, we started this work by engineering mice with new Llgl2 mutation which generates 
strong loss-of-function allele upon Cre-mediated recombination (Supplemental Fig.1). We then crossed 
these mice with our previously generated Llgl1flox/flox mice (Jossin et al. 2017). Both Llgl1 and Llgl2 
genes reside on mouse chromosome 11. Therefore, we relied on genetic crossing over to obtain mice 
with double targeted Llgl1 and Llgl2 alleles. To determine the role of the entire Lgl pathway in adult 
mouse tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression, we decided to make mice with deletion of both 
Llgl1/2 genes in skin epidermis utilizing our previously generated and characterized Keratin14-Cre mice 
(Vasioukhin et al. 1999).  
Unexpectedly, we found that inactivation of both Llgl1 and Llgl2 genes in skin epidermis gave rise to 
mice that were live and fertile. Western blot analyses and immunofluorescent stainings revealed loss 
of both LLGL1 and LLGL2 proteins in skin epidermis of Llgl1/2 cKO mice (Fig. 1A-C). We did not 
observe tumor development in these animals; however, we noticed that many older Llgl1/2 cKO mice 
lose hair and develop prominent wound–like lesions riddled with inflammation (Fig. 1D-F’). Deletion of 
many tumor-suppressor genes does not cause frank tumor development and their cancer-relevant 
functions becomes apparent only when these mutations are analyzed in tissues already predisposed 
to  cancer  development.  Therefore,  we  decided  to  analyze  Llgl1/2  in  cancer  sensitized  genetic 
background using conditional deletion of one allele of Trp53. 
Loss  of  Llgl1/2  genes  in  Trp53+/-  cancer  sensitized  genetic  background  (K14-
 
Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/+mice) results in highly penetrant development of skin SCCs, while cancer 
 
is extremely rare in K14-Cre/ Tp53fl/+mice.  
Trp53 is the most frequently inactivated tumor-suppressor in mammalian genome and it is frequently 
mutant in skin tumors. Mouse Trp53 resides on the same chromosome as Llgl1/2, and we again used 
crossing over to obtain mice with triple conditional Llgl1/2/Trp53 genes. These mice were used to 
generate double knockout of Llgl1 and Llgl2 and knockout of single allele of Trp53 (K14-Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl/ 
   
Tp53fl/+cKO mice). K14-Cre/Tp53fl/+cKO animals were used as controls. We found that while mice with 
deletion of Llgl1/2 and one allele of Trp53 develop skin SCC tumors with a half-time of ~13 months, no 
 
tumor  development  was  observed  in  control  K14-Cre/Tp53fl/+ cKO  animals  (Fig.  2).  Mice  with 
 
homozygous deletion of Trp53 (K14-Cre/Tp53fl/flmice) develop SCC tumors; however, simultaneous 
 
deletion of Llgl1/2 results in much earlier development of SCC tumors in K14-Cre/ Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/fl
mice  (p-value<0.0001,Supplementary  Fig.2).  These  data  provide  strong  genetic  proof  of  tumor 
suppression function of Llgl1/2-mediated signaling pathway in mouse epidermis. Moreover, since we 
 
observed a binary (tumors present, yes/no) phenotypic difference between K14-Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl/ Tp53fl/+
 
cKO and control K14-Cre/ Tp53fl/+cKO animals, these mutant mice combination provided us with an 
excellent in vivo model system to dissect the role of Lgl pathway in tumor suppression.  
Generation of Llgl1/2/Trp53 mutant and control primary mouse keratinocyte cell lines. 
To analyze the mechanisms of Lgl tumor-suppressive pathway in mouse epidermis, we decided to 
initiate the biochemical studies using cultured primary keratinocytes. Traditionally in the field, long-term 
 
cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes are established in low Ca2+E-media in the presence of NIH3T3

feeder cells (Vasioukhin et al. 2000).  However, low Ca2+conditions are highly artificial, as keratinocytes 
cannot form cell-cell junction structures and develop cohesive epithelial cell layer, which is present in 
skin epidermis in vivo. Therefore, we investigated various primary keratinocyte culture conditions and 
 
found that normal Ca2+organoid cell culture media developed in Dr. Hans Clevers’ laboratory (Karthaus 
et al. 2014) combined with coating of tissue culture plastic surface with laminin (Sigma) supports the 
growth, passaging and extensive expansion of primary mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 3). We used these 
     
conditions to establish primary cultures of keratinocytes from Llgl1/2 fl/fl, Llgl1/2 fl/fl /Tp53fl/+ and Trp53fl/+
mice. Infection of these cells with either Adenovirus-Cre-GFP or control Adenovirus-GFP particles 
generates genetic-background-matched pairs of mutant and control cell populations (Fig. 3A-C).  
Primary Llgl12-/-/Tp53+/- keratinocytes display prominent increase in cellular accumulation.  
 
To determine whether Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ cells display any phenotypes relevant to cellular transformation 
that can help to determine the mechanism of Llgl1/2 in tumor suppression, we analyzed Llgl1/2-/-, 
 
Llgl1/2-/-/Tp53-/+ and Trp53-/+ keratinocytes and their corresponding controls. We performed growth 
curve analyses and found that Llgl1/2-/-/Tp53-/+, but not their corresponding control, Llgl1/2-/- or Trp53-
 
/+ cells, display prominent increase in cellular accumulation (Fig. 3D). Similarly, Llgl1/2-/-/Tp53-/+ cells 
showed prominent increase in EdU incorporation (Fig. 3E). These tumor-relevant phenotypes resemble 
the situation in vivo, where we see tumor development in Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+, but not in Llgl1/2-/- or Trp53-
   
/+ cKO mice (Fig. 2). Therefore, we decided to utilize primary cultures of Llgl1/2-/-/Tp53-/+ keratinocytes 
and their corresponding controls to reveal the mechanisms of Llgl1/2 mediated tumor suppression.  
Activation of NF-kB signaling pathway in Llgl1/2-/- primary keratinocytes in culture. 
To obtain initial insights into the Llgl1/2 function in tumor suppression, we analyzed cell-autonomous 
transcriptional changes in Llgl1/2-/- primary keratinocytes. RNA-seq experiments revealed substantial 
changes in gene expression in Llgl1/2-/- cells (Fig. 4). Unbiased Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 
of these changes using “Hallmark Gene Sets” revealed activation of interferon alpha and beta signaling 
as two most significantly enriched gene sets (Fig. 4A). This was surprising because LLGLs have not 
been previously associated with innate immune signaling pathways. To continue our analysis of 
signaling pathways in Llgl1/2-/- cells, we performed Western blot experiments with proteins extracted 
from cultured primary keratinocytes. Since Lgl has been previously strongly implicated in regulation of 
Hippo signaling pathway (Jukam and Desplan 2011; Parsons et al. 2014a; Li et al. 2017), which plays 
a very important tumor suppressive role in skin epidermis (Silvis et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016), we analyzed 
potential changes in YAP1 levels and its inhibitory S127 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, we did 
not observe a decrease but rather a mild increase in S127 specific phosphorylation of YAP1 (P-S127 
YAP1/total YAP1) in Llgl1/2-/- primary keratinocytes (Fig.4B). Since our RNA-Seq experiments detected 
cell autonomous changes in interferon signaling in Llgl1/2-/- keratinocytes (Fig. 4A), we analyzed NF-
kB signaling pathway. Consistent with data from transcriptional analysis, Western blot experiments 
revealed prominent increase in specific phosphorylation of Ser536 of RelA (NF-kB p65) (Fig. 4B). 
Specific phosphorylation of IKK-beta, an NF- kB kinase, which phosphorylates RelA at S536, was also 
increased in Llgl1/2-/- keratinocytes (Fig. 4B). These data revealed activation of NF-kB signaling in 
Llgl1/2-/- keratinocytes. The NF-kB signaling activation was specific to cells with deletion of Llgl1/2, as 
it was observed in both Llgl1/2-/-and Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ but not in Tp53-/+ keratinocytes (Fig. 4B).

Activation of NF-kB signaling pathway in Llgl1/2-/- epidermis in vivo. 
Since we found activation of NFkB signaling pathway in Llgl1/2-/- keratinocytes in culture, we thought to 
determine whether this signaling pathway is also activated in Llgl1/2-/-  cKO skin epidermis in vivo. For 
 
this purpose we isolated epidermises from K14-Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl, K14-Cre/Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/+ and control 
 
K14-Cre/ Tp53fl/+ cKO mice and analyzed them using RNA-Seq and Western blotting techniques. 
Similar to our findings in cultured keratinocytes, RNA-Seq and Western blot experiments revealed 
increase  in  activating  phosphorylations  of  RelA  (P-Ser536)  and  IKKbeta  (P-Ser180)  indicating 
 
activation of NFkB signaling pathway in epidermises from Llgl1/2-/- and Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+but not from 
 
control Trp53-/+cKO mice (Fig.5). We also found an increase in activating phosphorylation of atypical 
PKCiota (aPKCi) in Llgl1/2-/-  epidermis (Fig. 5B). This is consistent with previous findings reporting 
strong interaction between LLGL proteins and aPKC and negative regulation of aPKC by LLGLs 
(Almagor et al. 2019; Scott et al. 2019). aPKC can directly phosphorylate and activate IKK-beta at 
Ser180 and activated IKK-beta directly phosphorylates and activates RelA at Ser536 (Lallena et al. 
1999).  Thus, LLGL1/2-loss mediated activation of aPKC can result in activation of IKKbeta and the 
entire NFkB signaling pathway.  
RelA and aPKCi are necessary for hyperproliferation of Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ keratinocytes. 
We hypothesized that increased aPKC-NFkB activity can cooperate with the loss of one allele of Trp53 
to induce SCC tumor formation in Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+cKO epidermis. To begin to address this hypothesis 
we analyzed the significance of these signaling pathways in hyperproliferation phenotype of Llgl1/2-/-
/Trp53-/+ keratinocytes. RelA is a critical and one of the most abundant NF-kB subunits in skin epidermis 
(Poligone et al. 2013). To determine the significance of RELA we inactivated RelA in Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ 
and  control  Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/+  keratinocytes.  Knockdown  of  RelA  with  two  independent  shRNA 
constructs  erased  the  differences  in  EdU  incorporation  between  Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+  and  control 
Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/+ cells (Fig. 6A,B). Mutation of RelA using two independent CRISPR/Cas9 constructs 
resulted  in  similar  phenotype  (Fig.  6C,  D).  We  conclude  that  RelA  activity  is  necessary  for 
hyperproliferation phenotype of Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ keratinocytes.  
We hypothesized that activated aPKC is responsible for increased NF-kB signaling in Llgl1/2-/- cells. 
Indeed, shRNA mediated knockdown of aPKCi erased the differences in activating phosphorylation of 
IKK-beta and RelA between Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ and control Llgl1/2fl/fl/Tp53fl/+ keratinocytes (Fig. 7A-C). 
Moreover, knockdown of aPKCi also erased the differences in EdU incorporation between these cells 
(Fig. 7D). Therefore, we conclude that Llgl1/2-loss mediated activation of aPKC-NF-kB signaling 
pathway is responsible for hyperproliferation of Llgl1/2-/-/Trp53-/+ keratinocytes.  
 
DISCUSSION 
Lgl in Drosophila regulates asymmetric cell division of stem cells and functions as a tumor suppressor 
(Bilder et al. 2000).  Since mammalian genomes contain two drosophila Lgl homologues (Llgl1 and 
Llgl2) that have different expression patterns and different mutant phenotypes, it has been difficult to 
assess whether the overall function of the Lgl signaling pathway is consistent between flies and 
mammals (Klezovitch et al. 2004; Sripathy et al. 2011). Indeed, the published data are somewhat

confusing and fragmented. Depending on the model system, Llgl1 and Llgl2 were strongly implicated 
in both tumor suppressive and tumor promoting functions (Hawkins et al. 2014; Li et al. 2017; Daynac 
et al. 2018; Saito et al. 2019). To begin to address the role of the entire Lgl signaling pathway in 
mammalian cancer, in this study we decided to generate mouse mutant with inactivation of both Llgl1 
and Llgl2 genes. This work revealed that Lgl signaling functions as a tumor suppressor in mammalian 
epidermis. This finding is consistent with extensively characterized role of Lgl in Drosophila model 
system indicating the conservation of Lgl function between flies and mammals (Bilder 2004). 
To determine the potential mechanisms of tumor-suppressive function of Lgl signaling pathway in skin 
epidermis  we  performed  unbiased  RNA-Seq  analyses.  Activation  of  NF-kB  signaling  in  Llgl1/2-/- 
epidermis  and  cultured  primary  keratinocytes  was  the  most  notable  change  revealed  by  these 
experiments.  This  was  completely  unexpected,  because  Lgl  signaling  has  not  been  previously 
implicated in regulation of NF-kB pathway. In fact, previously published information concerning the 
molecular mechanisms of LLGL1/2 in regulation of cell proliferation was somewhat incoherent, with 
regulation of Notch signaling (Portela et al. 2015), Hippo pathway (Grzeschik et al. 2010; Parsons et 
al. 2014a; Greenwood et al. 2016), integrin b1 (Ma et al. 2022), MET, ErbB, and EGFR tyrosine kinase 
signaling (Reischauer et al. 2009; Kashyap et al. 2013; Greenwood et al. 2016), and ubiquitin-mediated 
 
degradation (Yamashita et al. 2015) proposed as potential mechanisms in different studies. Here we 
provide strong in vivo evidence that the NF-kB signaling is the critical mechanism of Lgl function in 
mammalian organism. Moreover, our experiments in primary cells indicate that this is a cell autonomous 
and important for regulation of cell proliferation Lgl function.  
We have also determined that negative regulation of aPKC is the critical function of mammalian Lgl 
signaling pathway which is responsible for NF-kB regulation. Connection between Lgl and aPKC has 
been well established and this function is responsible for Lgl-mediated tumor suppressive function in 
Drosophila, although it is not known whether it also involves the NF-kB pathway downstream of aPKC 
(Lee et al. 2006). While we found that NF-kB signaling downstream from aPKC is critical for LLGL1/2-
mediated regulation of cell proliferation in cells in culture, it is not clear if NF-kB is indeed a signaling 
pathway that is responsible for Lgl tumor suppressive function in vivo. Future in vivo studies will help 
to address this question.  
While we found that activation of NF-kB was important for Lgl function in regulation of cell proliferation, 
it is curious that this was evident only in cells with inactivation of one allele of Trp53. We used Trp53 in 
our studies, because Trp53 is a relevant for skin epidermis tumor suppressor which is altered in 70% 
of human skin SCC tumors (Inman et al. 2018). Interestingly, Tp53 is one of the tumor suppressor 
genes that shows strong haploinsufficiency, where the loss of only one allele is functionally significant 
(Berger and Pandolfi 2011; Winiecka-Klimek et al. 2014). For example, Trp53+/- thymocytes display 
impaired apoptosis (Clarke et al. 1993) Overall, reduction in TP53 dosage and function can impact 
cellular functions that play an important role in tumor suppression (Berger et al. 2011). If deletion of 
Llgl1/2 results in both increased proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death, it is possible that 
decreased expression of TRP53 in Trp53+/- keratinocytes rescues the apoptotic part of Lgl function and 
thus reveals its role in stimulation of cell proliferation and tumor suppression. Future studies will have 
to  experimentally  address  this  potential  explanation  of  Llgl1/2  and  Trp53  cooperation  in  tumor

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Animal Models  
All procedures involving mice and experimental protocols were approved by the IACUC of Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC) and followed NIH guidelines for animal welfare. Mice with a 
conditional Llgl1 allele (Llgl1tm1Vv) were previously generated in our laboratory (Jossin et al. 2017). R1 
ES cells with Llgl2 gene trapped using UPA vector (clone # 422C9, Llgl2Gt(422C9)Cmhd) were obtained 
from Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics. Llgl2 mutant mice were generated by microinjection of ES 
cells  into  mouse  embryo  using  conventional  embryonic  stem  cell  technology.  PCR  with  oligos 
Lgl2trap2b-3′ (5′-caggcgcataaaatcagtca-3’), Lgl2trap2e (5′-gaagagtgaggtagaatctc-3′) and Lgl2trapeA 
(5′- cactctgctggatgacaata-3’) was used for genotyping (Llgl2+ wild-type allele, 0.57 kB; Llgl2fl floxed 
allele, 1kB). Conditional floxed Trp53 mice (Trp53tm1Brn) were obtained from NCI repository (stock # 
01XC2). 
Crossing over was used to place Llgl1 and Llgl2 mutant alleles on the same chromosome. For this 
purpose, mice with homozygous Llgl1 allele were crossed with animals with homozygous Llgl2 allele 
and resulting double heterozygous mice were crossed again to Llgl1fl/fl mice. Progeny with crossing 
over event were genotyped as Llgl1fl/fl/Llgl2fl/+. These animals were crossed to each other to obtain 
double  homozygous  Llgl1fl/fl/Llgl2fl/fl  mice.  Similar  approach  was  used  to  generate  triple  mutant 
Llgl1fl/fl/Llgl2fl/fl/Trp53fl/fl and Llgl1fl/fl/Llgl2fl/fl/Trp53+/fl mice. 
For skin epidermis specific gene targeting, mutant Llgl1/2, Llgl1/2/Trp53 and Trp53 mice were crossed 
with our K14-Cre animals (Vasioukhin et al. 1999). All mice were maintained on a mixed 129S1/SvlmJ 
/ C57BL/6J/ genetic background. 
Tissue dissection, histology and immunohistochemistry  
For paraffin sections, the new born skins were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS overnight, processed 
and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5μm thick) were stained and imaged using a Nikon TE 200 
microscope. For cryosections, tissues were frozen in OCT and sectioned (7μm thick) using a Leica 
cryostat. For histology, sections were stained with hematoxilin & eosin.  For immunofluorescent 
staining, skin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and antigenic sites were unmasked using either 
Tris-EDTA (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 1mM EDTA; 0.05% Tween-20) or citric acid-based unmasking 
solution (Vector Laboratories) in Pascal pressure chamber (Dako). The sections were immunostained 
using EnVision and ARK kits (DAKO, K400311-2 and K395411-8) according to manufacturer protocols. 
For immunofluorescent staining of frozen sections, slides were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 
15 minutes. Cells were permeabilized with 1xPBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes and incubated 
with  primary  antibodies  overnight  at  4°  C.  Primary  antibodies  were  detected  using  anti-mouse-
conjugated  Texas  Red  (Jackson  ImmunoResearch,  115-075-075)  and  anti-rabbit-conjugated 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-095-152) secondary antibodies. 
Sections were mounted using mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, ab104139) and imaged using 
confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 800 (Zeiss).  
Primary mouse keratinocyte cell isolation and culture  
Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from new-born pups as previously described (Vasioukhin 
et al. 2000). 1x106 cells were plated on one well of 6 well-plate previously coated with  10µg/ml  of 
laminin (Sigma, #L2020) in 1xPBS for 1 hour at 37C. Keratinocytes were cultured in Keratinocyte 
serum-free media (KSFM) containing: Advanced DMEM/F-12 media (Thermo Fisher, 12634-010), 1x 
B27 Supplement (Thermo Fisher, 17504-001), 10 mM HEPES, 2mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher,

35050-061), 1.25 mM N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma, A9165), 1 μM prostaglandin E2 (Tocris, 2296), 10 
mM Nicotinamide, 100 μg/ml primocin, 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech, 315-09), 500nM A83-01 (Tocris, 
2939), 500 ng/ml R-Spondin (Peprotech, 120-38) and 100 ng/ml Noggin (Peprotech, 120-10C). Media 
was replaced every 2 days.  Cells were passaged 1:5. To passage, cells were incubated with dispase 
(Stem Cell Technologies, 07913) containing 10 µm Y-27632 for 5 minutes at 37C, disrupted by pipetting 
and transferred to 15mL conical tube. Cells were spinned down, washed once in KSFM and plated on 
 
laminin coated plates To generate paired Llgl1/2-/-, Llgl1/2-/-/Tp53-/+ and Trp53-/+ and corresponding 
  
control primary mouse cultures, keratinocytes from Llgl1/2fl/fl, Llgl1/2fl/fl /Tp53fl/+  and Trp53fl/+ mice were 
infected with adenoviruses carrying Cre (Ad5CMVCre-eGFP) or GFP as control (Ad5CMVeGFP), 
which were purchased from the University of Iowa Viral Vector Core Facility. Knockout efficiency was 
validated by PCR and western blot analysis.  
Cell line culture and lentivirus production  
Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM 
media (Thermo Fisher, 11965-092) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), sodium pyruvate (Thermo 
Fisher, 11360-070), non-essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher, 11140-050) and primocin (InvivoGen). 
Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells as described (Lois et al. 2002).  
Western blot analysis and Immunofluorescent staining of cultured keratinocytes 
For western blot analysis, cells or mouse newborn epidermises were lysed on ice using RIPA buffer 
RIPA buffer [ 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1%NP-40, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT] 
containing a protease (Thermo Fisher, A32955) and phosphatase (Thermo Fisher, A32957) inhibitor 
cocktails. Protein extracts containing equal amounts of protein (50 µg) were solubilized in 1xLDS 
Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP0007) and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/ polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis  (SDS-PAGE),  and  transferred  to  PVDF  membranes  (Millipore,  IPVH00010). 
Membranes were incubated with primary and species-specific HRP-labeled secondary antibodies 
(Jackson  ImmunoResearch  Laboratories),  that  were  detected  using  immobilon  western 
chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, WBKLS0500). 
For EdU incorporation experiment 1.0 x104 primary keratinocytes were plated in triplicates on glass 
cover sleeps coated with laminin. Growing in KSFM cells were incubated for 1 hour with 10mM EdU, 
washed with PBS, fixed for 15 mins in 3.7% formaldehyde in 1xPBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% 
Triton-X100 in 1xPBS. Keratinocytes were stained for EdU using Click-iT EdU kit (Invitrogen, C10340) 
and then blocked in Superblock (ThermoFisher Scientific, 37515) + 5% Normal Goat Serum (Jackson 
Immunoresearch)  for  1  hour  at  room  temperature.  Cover  sleeps  were  incubated  with  anti-Ki67 
antibodies (1:200) overnight at 40C, washed and incubated with anti-rabbit-conjugated fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-095-152) secondary antibodies. The coverslips 
were mounted on microscope slides using Mounting Medium with DAPI (Abcam, ab104139) and 
imaged using confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 800 (Zeiss) and quantified using image J 
software.

Total RNA was extracted with QIAzol (QIAGEN) followed by RNase-free DNAase treatment (QIAGEN) 
and purification using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). RNA concentration, purity, and integrity was assessed by 
NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) and Agilent TapeStation. RNA-seq libraries were constructed 
from 1 ug total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol.  Barcoded libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq S1 100 flowcell 
generating 50 bp paired end reads.  Sequencing reads were mapped to the mm10 mouse genomes 
using STAR.v2.7.3a1. Gene level abundance was quantitated using GenomicAlignments (Lawrence et 
al. 2013) and analyzed using limma(Ritchie et al. 2015), filtered for a minimum expression level using 
the filterByExpr function with default parameters prior to testing, and using the Benjamin-Hochberg 
false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. Genome-wide gene expression results were ranked by their 
limma t-statistics and used to conduct Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to determine patterns of 
pathway activity utilizing the curated pathways from within the MSigDBv7.4(Subramanian et al. 2005). 
Statistical Analyses  
Statistical significance was determined by Student’s, Fisher’s exact, Mann-Whitney, or Chi-square 
tests. p value is indicated by asterisks in the figures: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Differences at 
p = 0.05 and lower were considered statistically significant. In RNA-seq analyses, the differences with 
FDR < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
