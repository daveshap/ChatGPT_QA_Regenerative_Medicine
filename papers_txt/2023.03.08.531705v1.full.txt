31  SUMMARY 
32  Differentiated transporting epithelial cells present an extensive apical array of microvilli – 
33  a “brush border” – where neighboring microvilli are linked together by intermicrovillar 
34  adhesion  complexes  (IMACs)  composed  of  protocadherins  CDHR2  and  CDHR5. 
35  Although loss-of-function studies provide strong evidence that IMAC function is needed 
36  to  build  a  mature  brush  border,  how  the  IMAC  contributes  to  the  stabilization  and 
37  accumulation of nascent microvilli remains unclear. We found that, early in differentiation, 
38  the apical surface exhibits a marginal accumulation of microvilli, characterized by higher 
39  packing density relative to medial regions of the surface. While medial microvilli are highly 
40  dynamic  and  sample  multiple  orientations  over  time,  marginal  protrusions  exhibit 
41  constrained motion and maintain a vertical orientation. Unexpectedly, we found that 
42  marginal microvilli span the junctional space and contact protrusions on neighboring cells, 
43  mediated  by  complexes  of  CDHR2/CDHR5.  FRAP  analysis  indicated  that  these 
44  transjunctional IMACs are highly stable relative to adhesion complexes between medial 
45  microvilli, which explains the restricted motion of protrusions in the marginal zone. Finally, 
46  long-term  live  imaging  revealed  that  the  accumulation  of  microvilli  at  cell  margins 
47  consistently leads to accumulation in medial regions of the cell. Collectively, our findings 
48  suggest that nascent microvilli are stabilized by a capture mechanism that is localized to 
49  cell margins and enabled by the transjunctional formation of IMACs. These results inform 
50  our understanding of how apical specializations are assembled in diverse epithelial 
51  systems.

53  INTRODUCTION 
54  Organ function depends on specialized cell types that have evolved morphologies to 
55  enable specific physiological tasks. Transporting epithelial cells, found in the intestine and 
56  kidney proximal tubule, offer interesting examples of this phenomenon. As important sites 
57  of solute uptake, maximizing apical surface area is a critical facet of these tissues. To 
58  meet  this  challenge,  epithelial  cells  extend  1000s  of  bristle-like  protrusions  called 
59  microvilli, which pack tightly into a highly ordered array to collectively form a brush border 
60  [1,  2].  A  single  microvillus  is  a  cylinder-shaped,  micron-scale  membrane  protrusion 
61  supported by a core actin bundle consisting of 20-40 actin filaments  [3, 4]. By scaffolding 
62  apical membrane in this way, microvilli amplify surface area available for solute transport 
63  and optimize solute uptake potential [5-7]. Microvilli first appear on the cell surface very 
64  early in epithelial maturation; differentiating cells, like those found within intestinal stem 
65  cell-containing crypts, exhibit few, poorly organized microvilli [8]. However, differentiated, 
66  fully functional enterocytes, found on the villus or within the kidney tubule, present a well-
67  organized brush border consisting of densely packed protrusions [3, 9, 10].  
68  Several previous studies established that tight microvillar packing is driven by a 
69  protocadherin-based intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which physically links the 
70  distal tip of a microvillus to the tips of its neighboring microvilli [11-14]. In the case of the 
71  enterocyte, these adhesive interactions give rise to a hexagonal packing pattern when 
72  viewed en face, which represents maximum surface occupancy. Previous work also 
73  identified protocadherins CDHR2 and CDHR5 as the primary adhesive elements in these 
74  links, which form trans heterophilic adhesion complexes that are well suited for bridging 
75  the  ~50  nm  gap  between  neighboring  microvilli  [11,  15].    CDHR2  and  CDHR5 
76  ectodomains  contain  multiple  extracellular  cadherin  (EC)  repeat  motifs  arranged  in 
77  tandem, which are anchored to the membrane via a single spanning transmembrane 
78  domain [16]. Both protocadherins also contain cytoplasmic tails at their C-termini, which 
79  enable direct interactions with cytoplasmic IMAC binding partners including the actin-
80  based motor, myosin-7B (MYO7B), and the scaffolding proteins, ankyrin repeat and 
81  sterile alpha motif domain containing 4B (ANKS4B) and usher syndrome 1C (USH1C) 
82  [12, 13, 17, 18]. Recently, calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4) was identified as a direct 
83  binding partner of MYO7B, making it an additional IMAC component [19]. KD studies of

84  MYO7B indicate that this motor plays a key role in the localization of CDHR2/CDHR5 
85  adhesion complexes to the distal tips of microvilli [12, 13]. In the differentiating CACO-
86  2BBE intestinal epithelial cell culture model, disrupting the function of the IMAC via calcium 
87  chelators or knockdown of any single complex component leads to striking defects in 
88  microvillar  growth  and  packing  organization  during  differentiation  [11-13,  19]. 
89  Furthermore, complete loss of CDHR2 from intestinal and kidney epithelia in a villin-Cre 
90  driven knockout (KO) mouse, causes shortening and loss of brush border microvilli, a 
91  consequential decrease in the apical enrichment of key solute transporters, and reduced 
92  animal growth rate [14]. 
93  How new microvilli assemble and incorporate into a highly ordered brush border 
94  during differentiation remains unclear. Ultrastructural studies of native tissue and time-
95  lapse  imaging  of  epithelial  cell  culture  models  indicate  that  microvilli  do  not  grow 
96  synchronously,  but  instead  appear  stochastically  on  the  apical  surface  throughout 
97  differentiation [8, 11, 20]. One critical factor that promotes microvillar growth is the barbed 
98  end binder, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8) [20, 21]. 
99  Previous studies in multiple epithelial and non-epithelial systems have established that 
100  EPS8 is a highly specific marker of the distal ends of all forms of actin bundle supported 
101  protrusions [22-25]. Loss of this factor leads to shorter protrusions and increased length 
102  variability [26, 27]. Strikingly, on the apical surface of differentiating epithelial cells, EPS8 
103  arrives in diffraction-limited puncta at the membrane minutes before the subsequent 
104  growth of a core actin bundle and assembly of a microvillus at these sites [20]. Even once 
105  a core bundle begins to elongate, EPS8 puncta remain persistently associated with the 
106  distal end of the nascent structure. Following their initial growth, nascent microvilli are 
107  highly motile and translocate across the apical surface via a mechanism powered by 
108  treadmilling of the underlying core actin bundle [28], an activity that is also regulated by 
109  EPS8 [28]. Remarkably, if the distal tip of a newly formed microvillus loses its EPS8 
110  punctum, that structure rapidly collapses, suggesting that EPS8 serves as a microvillus 
111  survival  factor  [20].  These  data  also  point  to  a  previously  unrecognized  dynamic 
112  microvillus lifecycle, consisting of distinct phases of structural stability and instability. For 
113  microvilli to eventually accumulate in large numbers on the apical surface, this cycle must

114  ultimately tilt in favor of stability. However, how dynamic, nascent microvilli are stabilized 
115  on the apical surface so that they eventually accumulate long-term remains unknown.  
116  Here we report our discovery of an adhesion-based mechanism that epithelial cells 
117  use to stabilize and in turn, drive the accumulation of microvilli during differentiation. 
118  Because microvillar growth takes place as differentiating enterocytes move through the 
119  crypt-villus transition [8], we reasoned that we could gain insight on mechanisms of 
120  microvilli accumulation by careful inspection of apical morphology in this region. Using 
121  this approach, we discovered that crypt microvilli initially accumulate at cell margins, 
122  implying the existence of a mechanism for anchoring nascent protrusions at these sites. 
123  We observed similar marginal accumulation of microvilli on the surface of differentiating 
124  intestinal and kidney epithelial cell lines. In all models examined, microvilli extending from 
125  one cell span intercellular space to make physical contact with microvilli on a neighboring 
126  cell. Using super-resolution microscopy, mechanistic studies in epithelial cell culture 
127  models, and live imaging, we determined that these points of physical contact represent 
128  “transjunctional IMACs” containing both CDHR2 and CDHR5, which are highly stable 
129  complexes that capture nascent microvilli and constrain their motion. Consistent with this 
130  point,  long-term  live  imaging  revealed  that  microvilli  accumulation  at  cell  margins 
131  outpaces accumulation in medial regions of the surface early in differentiation. Thus, 
132  microvilli extending from neighboring epithelial cells participate in a novel form of epithelial 
133  cell-cell contact that promotes apical surface maturation. The adhesion-based capture 
134  mechanism reported is likely to inform our understanding of apical morphogenesis in 
135  other epithelial cell types that build surface specializations. 
136   
137  RESULTS 
138  Differentiating epithelial cells exhibit a marginal enrichment of microvilli  
139  To begin to understand how microvilli are stabilized and accumulate in large numbers 
140  during differentiation, we first examined the distribution of nascent protrusions early in the 
141  maturation process. To this end, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to survey 
142  the apical surface of the crypt cells in fractured samples of mouse small intestine. Within 
143  the crypt, where immature enterocytes are actively assembling a brush border (Fig. 1A, 
144  zoom), we noted a striking enrichment of microvilli at cell margins (Fig. 1B, zoom 1 and

145  2 blue outlines). In contrast, medial regions of the apical surface presented only a few, 
146  sparse microvilli (Fig. 1B). Thus, in vivo, microvilli appear to accumulate at the edges of 
147  cells during the early stages of brush border assembly.  
148  To determine if the marginal accumulation of microvilli that we observed on the 
149  surface of differentiating crypt cells in vivo could be recapitulated in vitro, we first turned 
150  to the CACO-2BBE line. CACO-2BBE cells are a human intestinal epithelial cell culture 
151  model that builds a well-organized brush border over the course of several weeks at post-
152  confluency [29]. SEM imaging of CACO-2BBE cells early in the differentiation time-course 
153  revealed a concentration of microvilli at cell margins similar to that observed in native 
154  crypts (Fig 1C). Moreover, protrusions in these regions appeared to span cell junctions 
155  and make physical contact with structures on neighboring cells (Fig. 1C, zoom blue 
156  arrows). As an additional point of comparison, we also examined SEM images of sub-
157  confluent porcine kidney proximal tubule LLC-PK1 clone 4 (CL4) cells [30], which also 
158  exhibited a marginal accumulation of microvilli (Fig. 1D, zoom blue outline), even at the 
159  earliest stages of cell surface organization (i.e. subconfluence). Based on these in vivo 
160  and in vitro observations, the differentiating apical surface is characterized by two distinct 
161  populations  of  microvilli,  marginal  vs.  medial  (Fig.  1E),  with  the  marginal  region 
162  demonstrating higher protrusion packing density at these early time points.  
163   
164  Microvilli adopt a vertical orientation upon arriving at cell margins 
165  In the ultrastructural images alluded to above, we noted that marginal microvilli appeared 
166  more vertically oriented relative to microvilli extending from medial parts of the cell 
167  surface. Here we use ‘vertical’ to describe an orientation that is parallel to the long 
168  (apicobasal) axis of the cell and perpendicular to the plane of the apical surface. To 
169  confirm this observation under hydrated conditions, we performed volume imaging of live 
170  sub-confluent CL4 cells expressing mCherry-Espin (ESPN), which serves as a highly 
171  specific marker of microvillar core actin bundles [20, 28, 31, 32] (Fig. 2A). Lateral viewing 
172  of  reconstructed  volumes  enabled  us  to  visualize  individual  microvilli  and  obtain 
173  measurements of their orientation relative to the plane of the apical surface. This analysis 
174  revealed that the marginal and medial microvilli demonstrate significant differences in

175  their angle of protrusion, with marginal microvilli exhibiting a more vertical orientation 
176  (46.5° ± 19.3° vs. 77.3° ± 12.4°, Fig. 2B).  
177  Previous studies established that nascent microvilli are highly dynamic, growing, 
178  collapsing, and adopting a range of angles while undergoing active movement across the 
179  medial cell surface [20, 28]. With this in mind, we next sought to determine if microvilli 
180  grow in a vertical orientation at marginal sites or instead, grow medially and then adopt a 
181  vertical orientation upon arriving at the cell edge. To this end, we performed multi-hour 
182  time-lapse volume imaging to record microvillar motion and orientation in 3D. To help us 
183  interpret these complex datasets, we depth-coded volumes with a multi-color look-up 
184  table (LUT) so that image planes located further from the apical surface were rendered 
185  with warmer colors. While the dense accumulation of microvilli at cell margins impaired 
186  our ability to resolve individual growth events at these sites, we did observe individual 
187  protrusions and small adherent clusters of microvilli migrating while maintaining a small 
188  angle relative to the medial apical surface, as previously described [20, 28]. Following 
189  these microvilli over time (> 2 hrs) revealed that upon reaching the cell margin, they 
190  become more vertically orientated as indicated by the distal tips acquiring a warmer color 
191  coding (Figs. 2C,D and  Video S1). Although these data do not allow us to rule out the 
192  possibility that microvilli grow de novo in a vertical orientation in the marginal zone, they 
193  do indicate that medial microvilli can transition into the marginal zone and adopt a vertical 
194  orientation upon doing so. 
195   
196  Marginal microvilli are less motile than medial microvilli 
197  Vertically orientated microvilli are a defining feature of mature brush borders on the 
198  surface of villus enterocytes [3]. Based on this point, the vertically oriented microvilli found 
199  in  the  marginal  zone  may  represent  more  mature,  and  potentially,  more  stable 
200  protrusions. To begin to test this concept, we expressed EGFP-EPS8 to specifically mark 
201  the distal tips of microvilli [20, 21] in CL4 cells also expressing mCherry-ESPN (Fig. 3A, 
202  zooms). We then performed live volume imaging with the goal of using the punctate and 
203  stoichiometric EPS8 signal (one punctum per microvillus) as a high-fidelity fiducial marker 
204  for tracking microvillar dynamics over time. Temporal color coding of the ESPN channel 
205  over the course of 25 minutes revealed that medial microvilli are highly dynamic and

206  demonstrate extensive movement as previously reported [28] (Fig. 3B, zoom 1). In 
207  contrast, marginal microvilli appeared to dwell for long periods near the edge of the cell, 
208  as indicated by the white band of color (merged colors of time points 0-25 min) in the 
209  projection  (Fig.  3B,  zoom  2).  Next,  we  tracked  individual  EGFP-EPS8  puncta  and 
210  generated  rose  plots  of  the  resulting  trajectories  to  examine  the  extent  of  motion 
211  demonstrated by individual microvilli. This analysis revealed that medial microvilli produce 
212  long trajectories consistent with directed motion, sampling an area of up to 6 µm2 during 
213  the time-lapse period (Figs. 3C,D). By comparison, the trajectories of marginal microvilli 
214  were highly confined, with individual protrusions traveling less than 2 µm2 over the same 
215  time course (Figs. 3F,G). Mean squared displacement analysis of trajectory data [28] 
216  confirmed that marginal microvilli are ~10-fold more constrained in their movement (Fig. 
217  3H) relative to medial protrusions (Fig. 3E). Together, these data suggest the existence 
218  of a mechanism for restricting the motion of microvilli at cell margins. 
219   
220  Microvilli from neighboring cells are linked by transjunctional adhesion complexes 
221  containing CDHR2 and/or CDHR5 
222  Our ultrastructural data suggested that marginal accumulations of microvilli might include 
223  protrusions from both cells of a neighboring pair (Fig. 1C zoom).  This led us to consider 
224  the possibility that microvilli extending from one cell may span the junctional space and 
225  physically contact microvilli from an adjacent cell; such interactions might in turn explain 
226  the upright orientation, reduced motility, and eventual accumulation of microvilli at these 
227  sites.  One  potential  mechanism  for  mediating  such  interactions  involves  the 
228  intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which includes the protocadherins CDHR2 and 
229  CDHR5 as core components [11]. Previous studies established that CDHR2 and CDHR5 
230  target to the distal tips of microvilli and interact with each other to form a Ca2+-dependent 
231  heterophilic extracellular adhesion complex that spans the ~50 nm between adjacent 
232  protrusions [8-10]. The resulting link promotes the tight packing of neighboring microvilli 
233  and contributes to minimizing length variability throughout the larger structure of the brush 
234  border [16]. Notably, these previous studies on IMAC function focused solely on medial 
235  microvilli, so the possibility that this complex might also link microvilli from neighboring 
236  cells remains unexplored.

237  To test this idea, we used an immunostaining approach and super-resolution 
238  structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to examine the localization of CDHR2, CDHR5, 
239  and F-actin relative to ZO-1, a critical component of tight junctions [33]. For these studies, 
240  we first examined native small intestinal tissues isolated from a new mouse model 
241  expressing CDHR2 tagged with EGFP at the endogenous locus. SIM images revealed 
242  that both IMAC protocadherins are highly enriched at the tips of medial microvilli as 
243  previously reported (Fig. 4A) [11]. We also noted signal from CDHR2 and CDHR5 at the 
244  tips of microvilli at the margins of cells, with the adhesion protein signal spanning ZO-1 
245  marked junctions (Fig. 4B, top panel). When viewing projected SIM volumes en face, we 
246  were unable to discern the position of the tight junctions based solely on the phalloidin, 
247  CDHR2, or CDHR5 signals, suggesting that the IMAC components form a continuous 
248  network that spans beyond the surface of a single cell (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). Similarly, 
249  on the surface of mature enterocytes viewed with electron microscopy, microvilli appear 
250  to associate at neighboring cell interfaces (Fig. S1A-B). However, the crowded nature of 
251  microvilli in these mature brush borders confounded our attempts to isolate and visualize 
252  interactions between the tips of individual protrusions at the margins of neighboring cells.  
253  To work around the limitation imposed by microvillar crowding in native tissue, we 
254  used SIM to examine the apical surface of cultured CACO-2BBE cells at 12 days post-
255  confluence  (DPC),  a  time  point  before  brush  border  assembly  is  complete,  when 
256  microvillar packing density is comparatively lower. Careful examination of phalloidin-
257  stained CACO-2BBE monolayers revealed a striking enrichment and alignment of microvilli 
258  at the margins of cells (Fig. 4C,D), consistent with the SEM images described above (Fig. 
259  1B). Immunofluorescence staining of these 12 DPC cultures revealed that marginally 
260  aligned microvilli do in fact span the cell junction marked by ZO-1 and exhibit enrichment 
261  of both protocadherins at their distal tips (Fig. 4C,D, white arrows). We observed similar 
262  structures  and  staining  on  the  surface  of  CL4  monolayers  at  3  DPC,  a  stage  in 
263  differentiation when microvilli are still sparse but begin to form clusters and demonstrate 
264  marginal alignment (Fig. 4E). In this case, super-resolution lateral views clearly showed 
265  that individual microvilli from neighboring cells span the ZO-1-labeled tight junction and 
266  make contact via their distal tips, which are marked by both CDHR2 and CDHR5 (Fig. 4F

267  zooms). In combination, these results indicate that marginal microvilli on neighboring 
268  cells are physically linked via transjunctional IMACs that contain CDHR2 and CDHR5. 
269   
270  Heterophilic adhesion between CDHR2 and CDHR5 promotes robust association 
271  between microvilli from neighboring cells  
272  Although IMAC protocadherin adhesion properties differ across species [16], previous 
273  biochemical studies established that in humans, heterophilic complexes of CDHR2 and 
274  CDHR5 exhibit strong adhesion, CDHR2 demonstrates weak homophilic adhesion, and 
275  CDHR5  demonstrates  no  homophilic  adhesion  [11].  To  further  study  the  nature  of 
276  transjunctional IMACs, we developed a cell mixing approach that enabled us to drive the 
277  formation of adhesion complexes consisting of different complements of CDHR2 and/or 
278  CDHR5 (Fig. 5A). For these experiments, we first transfected CL4 cells with either EGFP 
279  or mCherry-tagged constructs of H. sapiens CDHR2 and CDHR5. Stable selection and 
280  subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) yielded robust populations of 
281  fluorescent  protocadherin  expressing  cells  (Fig.  S2A).  Strikingly,  mixed  monolayers 
282  composed of cells expressing CDHR2-EGFP or CDHR5-mCherry demonstrated robust 
283  alignment of protocadherin signals at mixed cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5B). Linescan analysis 
284  also revealed that CDHR2 and CDHR5 intensities were well correlated (mean r = 0.70) 
285  along these interfaces (Fig. 5C,D,K). These data are consistent with the formation of 
286  heterophilic  adhesion  complexes  between  microvilli  of  neighboring  cells.  In  mixed 
287  monolayers composed of cells expressing CDHR2-EGFP or CDHR2-mCherry (Fig. 5E), 
288  mixed cell-cell contacts lacked the strong alignment of signals that we observed in the 
289  heterophilic case, and protocadherin intensities were poorly correlated (mean r = 0.07 
290  (Fig.  5F,G,K).  Mixed  monolayers  composed  of  cells  expressing  CDHR5-EGFP  or 
291  CDHR5-mCherry  also  demonstrated  a  lack  of  signal  alignment  and  poor  intensity 
292  correlation along cellular junctions (mean r = -0.19) (Fig. 5H-K). High-resolution imaging 
293  of  the  interfaces  formed  under  each  of  these  three  conditions  revealed  that  only 
294  heterophilic mixtures of cells expressing CDHR2-EGFP or CDHR5-mCherry aligned their 
295  microvilli at cell-cell contacts (Fig. S2B-D, white arrows). Based on these data, we 
296  conclude that heterophilic transjunctional IMACs containing CDHR2 and CDHR5 can 
297  drive robust interactions between microvilli extending from neighboring cell margins.

298  Protocadherins in transjunctional IMACs exhibit limited turnover 
299  Under normal conditions, epithelial cells express both CDHR2 and CDHR5, which target 
300  to the tips of all microvilli on the apical surface. Thus, heterophilic complexes are expected 
301  to form between the distal tips of microvilli in both the medial and marginal regions. 
302  However, the strong alignment of microvilli at cell-cell contacts in the heterophilic case 
303  outlined above led us to predict that transjunctional IMACs may be more stable relative 
304  to complexes that form medially. If true, this would offer a mechanistic explanation for the 
305  reduced motility of marginal microvilli, and in turn, the accumulation of microvilli at these 
306  sites.  To  determine  if  transjunctional  IMACs  are  in  fact  longer  lived  than  medial 
307  complexes, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis 
308  with CL4 monolayers formed using the cell mixing approach outlined above (Fig. 5A). 
309  Strikingly, photobleached ROIs positioned over junctional interfaces between heterophilic 
310  CDHR2-EGFP and CDHR5-mCherry expressing cells demonstrated extremely low signal 
311  recovery for both protocadherins (immobile fractions, 0.71 and 0.85, respectively; Figs. 
312  6A,B and Video S2). In contrast, FRAP analysis of medially positioned ROIs on individual 
313  cells expressing both CDHR2-HALO and CDHR5-EGFP, revealed much lower immobile 
314  fractions for both protocadherins (0.47 and 0.56, respectively; Figs. 6C,D and Video S3). 
315  These results suggest that transjunctional IMACs formed between marginal microvilli are 
316  much longer lived relative to complexes formed between the tips of medial microvilli. We 
317  also examined recovery in photobleached ROIs positioned over junctional interfaces 
318  formed between homophilic CDHR2-EGFP and CDHR2-mCherry expressing cells (Figs. 
319  6E,F and Video S4), as well as interfaces formed between homophilic CDHR5-EGFP 
320  and CDHR5-mCherry expressing cells (Figs. 6G,H and Video S5). Both homophilic 
321  scenarios exhibited higher levels of turnover and even lower immobile fractions. Together, 
322  these  FRAP  studies  indicate  that  transjunctional  IMACs  composed  of  CDHR2  and 
323  CDHR5 are extremely stable, and these reduced turnover kinetics offer a explanation for 
324  the constrained motility and accumulation of microvilli observed at cell margins. 
325   
326  Microvillar packing density at cell margins is higher than the medial zone during 
327  differentiation

328  Based on the stabilizing nature of transjunctional IMACs, we predicted that, during 
329  differentiation, cells might assembly the brush border by packing microvilli inward from 
330  cell margins. To test this idea, we performed extended time-lapse imaging of CL4 cells 
331  expressing mCherry-ESPN to stoichiometrically label microvillar core actin bundles (Fig. 
332  7A-C)[32]. Comparing regional ESPN intensities on a per cell basis, we found that 
333  marginal ESPN intensity increased almost ~2-fold more than medial signal during 24 hrs 
334  of differentiation (Fig. 7D). These timelapse results are consistent with the idea that 
335  microvilli accumulate first at cell margins and then pack inwards from the edges of the 
336  cell over time.  
337   
338  DISCUSSION 
339  Previous live imaging studies of epithelial cells at times points early in differentiation 
340  established  that  actively  growing  and  newly  formed  microvilli  are  highly  motile  and 
341  unstable, undergoing rapid cycles of growth and collapse [20, 28]. Those discoveries 
342  immediately led us to question how dynamic, nascent microvilli are stabilized long-term 
343  on  the  apical  surface  to  enable  their  timely  accumulation  in  large  numbers  (i.e., 
344  thousands) by the end of differentiation. We first sought to approach this question by 
345  examining the surface of the undifferentiated epithelial cells that line the interior of the 
346  intestinal crypt, where microvillar growth activity is high. Because the apical surface of 
347  cells in this region is not yet fully packed with protrusions, we were hoping to identify 
348  patterns in the distribution of nascent microvilli that might offer insight on underlying 
349  mechanisms of stability.  
350  Peering into the crypt is technically challenging given the tight confines of this 
351  invaginated compartment. Indeed, almost all previous ultrastructural studies of this region 
352  have been limited to conventional transmission EM of ultrathin sections [34, 35], which 
353  are difficult to interpret in the absence of 3D context. We worked around this obstacle 
354  using a combination of tissue fracturing and scanning EM, which allowed us to visualize 
355  the apical surface of immature intestinal epithelial cells within the crypt. Inspection of 
356  these images revealed that microvilli preferentially accumulate near the cell periphery at 
357  this point in differentiation. Moreover, cell culture models from the intestine (CACO-2BBE) 
358  and kidney (CL4) also demonstrated robust marginal accumulation of microvilli early in 
  12

359  their maturation time course, suggesting that such patterning is not a function of the 
360  unique cellular packing geometry found in the crypt, nor is it tissue specific.  
361  Accumulation of microvilli at cell edges suggests that the marginal zone represents 
362  (i) a site of robust growth, (ii) a site of stabilization for nascent microvilli, or (iii) some 
363  combination of the two. Given the actin-rich junctional belt that surrounds the cell at the 
364  level of the terminal web [36], it seems reasonable to expect that microvilli may grow more 
365  readily in this location. Although previous live imaging studies of CL4 cells characterized 
366  the properties of individual microvillar growth events [20], those observations were limited 
367  to the medial regions of the cell where protrusion density is typically low; visualization of 
368  growth events in the marginal zone was confounded by the crowding of pre-existing 
369  microvilli in this region. While our data do not allow us to rule out the possibility that growth 
370  preferentially occurs at cell margins relative to medial regions, we were able to capture 
371  clear examples of clustered microvilli moving at a low angle relative to the cell surface, 
372  toward the edge of the cell and incorporating into the marginal population. Interestingly, 
373  these protrusions adopt the more vertical orientation of marginal microvilli upon reaching 
374  the cell edge. Because such upright orientation is a defining feature of microvilli in mature 
375  brush borders, the marginal population likely represents stabilized protrusions that persist 
376  into later stages of differentiation. Although we currently lack a method for tracking and 
377  measuring the lifetimes of individual microvilli over the course of days, our short-term 
378  tracking measurements using the tip marker, EPS8, confirm that marginal microvilli are 
379  less motile relative to medial microvilli. Indeed, using mean square displacement analysis 
380  as previously described [28], we found that marginal microvilli sample ~10-fold less 
381  surface area per unit time relative to medial microvilli, which is consistent with a physical 
382  capture mechanism near the cell edge. 
383     Earlier work established that medial microvilli on the surface of mature villus 
384  enterocytes  employ  the  protocadherins  CDHR2  and  CDHR5  to  form  intermicrovillar 
385  adhesion complexes (IMACs) that link the distal tips of neighboring microvilli [11, 15]. 
386  Here we sought to test the possibility that IMACs form across cell junctions, between the 
387  protrusions that extend from neighboring cells. If so, this would offer a mechanistic 
388  explanation for the upright orientation and constrained motility that microvilli demonstrate 
389  at  these  sites,  and  potentially  the  long-term  stabilization  that  enables  microvillar

390  accumulation on the apical surface in large numbers. Previous work in CACO-2BBE cells, 
391  native mouse intestinal tissue, and X-ray crystallography all indicate that the interacting 
392  ectodomains of CDHR2 and CDHR5 are structurally capable of spanning gaps up to 63 
393  nm wide [11, 16], suggesting that they could easily reach across the ~15 nm tight junction 
394  between neighboring cells [37]. Indeed, in the current study, super-resolution imaging 
395  revealed that CDHR2 and CDHR5 span the intercellular space to form transjunctional 
396  IMACs that physically link marginal microvilli that extend from neighboring cells.  
397  Does the formation of transjunctional IMACs explain the accumulation of microvilli 
398  at cell edges early in differentiation? If transjunctional IMACs are more stable and exhibit 
399  longer  lifetimes  relative  to  IMACs  that  form  medially,  this  would  certainly  offer  a 
400  mechanistic underpinning for the increase in microvilli density at these sites. To test this 
401  hypothesis, we employed a cell mixing approach that enabled us to induce the formation 
402  of  both  homophilic  and  heterophilic  transjunctional  IMACs,  to  enable  further 
403  characterization of their properties. FRAP analysis of the turnover dynamics of these 
404  complexes revealed that heterophilic (CDHR2/CDHR5) transjunctional IMACs are much 
405  longer lived relative to homophilic (CDHR2/CDHR2) complexes. These results from live 
406  epithelial cells echo previous in vitro data suggesting that homophilic (CDHR2/CDHR2) 
407  complexes  are  much  weaker  than  heterophilic  (CDHR2/CDHR5)  complexes  [11]. 
408  Interestingly, when we examined the dynamics of heterophilic complexes formed between 
409  microvilli in the medial population, we noted that these also turned over at a much higher 
410  rate  relative  to  transjunctional  heterophilic  (CDHR2/CDHR5)  complexes.  Thus,  the 
411  significant differential stability of transjunctional vs. medial IMACs indicated by our FRAP 
412  studies offers a mechanistic rationale for the accumulation of microvilli at cell margins.  
413  Why transjunctional IMACs are more stable than those formed elsewhere on the 
414  apical surface remains unclear, but possible explanations might be found in previous 
415  biophysical studies on the properties of non-covalent bonds. For example, when a tensile 
416  mechanical force is applied across a non-covalent bond formed between two proteins, 
417  the lifetime of that bond will be impacted in a way that depends on the structural nature 
418  of the bonding interface [38, 39]. “Slip bonds” react to loading with a dramatic shortening 
419  of lifetime, whereas “catch bonds” respond by increasing bond lifetime; “ideal bonds” 
420  exhibit  minimal  response  to  mechanical  loading  [38,  40,  41].  Direct  physical

421  measurements provide strong evidence for catch bond behavior in structurally diverse 
422  proteins, ranging from myosin motor domains to cell surface molecules such as integrins 
423  [42, 43]. Cadherins have been studied extensively in this regard and their bonding 
424  properties are complex. In the case of E-cadherin, adhesive interactions can exhibit slip 
425  or  catch  behavior  depending  on  the  conformation  of  the  adhesive  interface.  In  the 
426  canonical strand swapped conformation, E-cadherin exhibits slip bond behavior; while X-
427  dimers  of  E-cadherin,  which  interact  using  a  distinct  extended  structural  interface 
428  demonstrate robust catch bond behavior [40]. In light of those findings, we speculate that 
429  IMACs  also  exhibit  catch  bond  properties.  By  bridging  across  cell  junctions, 
430  transjunctional  IMACs  may  be  subject  to  higher  tensile  loads  and  therefore  exhibit 
431  increased adhesive lifetimes relative to IMACs that form elsewhere on the apical surface. 
432  Furthermore, as medial clusters of microvilli appear to move as a unit [28], their adhesive 
433  bonds may be under less tensile stress. Although rigorous testing of this concept must 
434  await future biophysical studies, it is important to note that, based on the recently solved 
435  structures of mouse and human CDHR2 and CDHR5 ectodomains [16], any catch bond 
436  behavior in the IMAC would emerge from a mechanism that is distinct from E-cadherin.   
437  Given the adhesive capture of microvilli by stable transjunctional IMACs and our 
438  observations of marginal microvilli enrichment early on in cell surface differentiation, we 
439  speculated that the brush border assembly may favor packing from the margins of the 
440  apical surface, inwards (Fig. 7E). To test this idea, we turned to multi-day time-lapse 
441  imaging of CL4 cells expressing mCherry-ESPN as a marker for microvilli. As expected, 
442  we noted that the marginal ESPN intensity was initially higher than in the medial region. 
443  After 24 hours of differentiation, the marginal region also demonstrated ~2-fold larger 
444  increase in signal relative to the medial zone, suggesting that microvillar packing density 
445  at the cell margin precedes packing of the interior apical surface.  Moreover, intensity at 
446  the cell margin is consistently higher than medial signal, and both regions increase in 
447  intensity over the course of almost two days of observation. In future studies, it will be 
448  critical to confirm this observation in systems that more closely recapitulate the biology of 
449  the crypt-villus transition, such as intestinal organoids.  
450    While previous work established that the IMAC is critical for maintaining brush 
451  border structure on mature enterocytes [14], the current study indicates a new role for this

452  complex in apical surface maturation, by contributing to a novel form of cell-cell contact 
453  between microvilli of neighboring cells. In the intestinal tract and other transporting 
454  epithelial tissue, cell-cell contacts are essential for “barrier” function and the maintenance 
455  of  physical  compartmentalization.  Interestingly,  Crohn’s  Disease  patients  exhibit  a 
456  decrease  in  CDHR2  and  CDHR5  mRNA  expression  [44]  while  also  experiencing 
457  increased intestinal permeability [45]. Transjunctional adhesion complexes may also form 
458  an  additional  layer  of  protection  against  colonizing  pathogens.  Infection  by  related 
459  pathogens Enteropathogenic and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) 
460  is characterized by effacement of brush border microvilli and F-actin pedestal formation 
461  [46]. CDHR2 has been identified as one of the initial EHEC targets during infection, which 
462  results in a significant decrease in CDHR2 expression [47]. Past reports on EPEC 
463  infection also show both bacteria localization over cell junctions [46, 48]. In the future 
464  studies, it will be fascinating to explore new roles for transjunctional IMACs in maintaining 
465  epithelial barrier function in intestinal disease and infection.

586  Figure 7: Long-term imaging reveals that microvilli first accumulate at cell margins 
587  over the course of differentiation. (A-C) MaxIP spinning disk confocal stills of live 
588  mCherry-ESPN expressing CL4 cells at t = 0 hours, 24 hours, and 43 hours from a 43-
589  hour acquisition. (A-C, intensity coded) Fire LUT intensity profile of the mCherry-ESPN 
590  channel. Intensity scales from low (0; dark purple) to high (255; yellow/white) as denoted 
591  by LUT profile. Zooms at each time point are outlined by dashed boxes, with marginal 
592  and medial zones as marked. (D) Mean marginal and medial mCherry-ESPN intensity of 
593  n = 10 cells from the time points shown in (A-C). Change in mean ESPN intensity (AU) in 
594  the first 24 hours is denoted on the graph. The cut axis accounts for background mCherry 
595  signal. Scale bars: 20 µm (A-C), 10 µm (zooms). (E) An adhesion-based model for the 
596  marginal stabilization of microvilli during brush border assembly. Microvilli on nascent 
597  transporting epithelial cells organize into two distinct populations: medial and marginal. 
598  Medial microvilli are highly motile while marginal microvilli are stable and stand at an 
599  orientation  more  vertical  to  the  apical  surface.  Transjunctional  CDHR2/CDHR5 
600  heterophilic adhesion complexes span cell-cell junctions and link marginal microvilli of 
601  neighboring cells. These complexes are long-lived, and lead to the accumulation of 
602  microvilli at the edges of cells. A predicted outside-in packing mechanism occurs during 
603  differentiation as a result of transjunctional adhesion complexes first stabilizing microvilli 
604  at cell margins.

609  Animal studies 
610  Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with Vanderbilt University Medical 
611  Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under IACUC Protocol 
612  ID#: M1600206-02.  
613   
614  CDHR2-EGFP mouse 
615  Created in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Genome Editing Resource. A C57Bl/6N strain 
616  containing  a  CDHR2  C-terminal  EGFP  sequence  insertion.  [crRNA  sequence: 
617  TGGACACCACAGATCTGTGA] Ribonucleoprotein complexes containing ctRNA and WT 
618  SpCas9 protein were targeted to the C-terminus of CDHR2 were assembled and injected 
619  with a single stranded 944 nt DNA donor into 1-cell C57Bl/6N embryos. crRNA, tracrRNA, 
620  and WT SpCas9 protein was sourced from MilliporeSigma. The single stranded DNA was 
621  produced by Genewiz. Pups were screened for CDHR2-EGFP sequence insertions by 
622  PCR and validated by Sanger sequencing.  
623   
624  Frozen Section Tissue Preparation 
625  The proximal segment (duodenum to jejunum) of the mouse intestinal tube was excised 
626  and flushed with cold 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). One end of the tube was 
627  clamped  with  a  hemostat  and  the  tube  was  filled  with  room  temperature  2% 
628  paraformaldehyde  (PFA)  (Electron  Microscopy  Sciences)  with  a  syringe  and  metal 
629  cannula. The other end of the tube was clamped with a hemostat and the tissue was laid 
630  in  a  petri  dish  containing  excess  2%  PFA  and  incubated  for  15  minutes  at  room 
631  temperature. Hemostats were removed and the tissue was cut lengthwise into one flat 
632  piece. Tissue was then sub dissected into ~2mm2 pieces and fixed for an additional 30 
633  minutes in a vial of 2% PFA at room temperature. After fixation, the tissue was washed 3 
634  times with PBS and then placed, villi-side down, into a vial of cold 30% sucrose/1% 
635  sodium azide. The tissue was placed at 4°C, overnight until sections sank to the bottom 
636  of the tube. The next day, sections were passed through 3 separate blocks of optimal

637  cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences) to wash off the 
638  sucrose solution, oriented with villi parallel to the lab bench in a fresh block of OCT, and 
639  snap frozen in dry ice-cooled acetone. Samples were cut into 10 µm thin sections using 
640  a Leica CM1950 cryostat and mounted on plasma-cleaned #1.5H precision coverslips 
641  (Thorlabs). Coverslips were stored at -20°C until staining. 
642   
643  Frozen Section Immunofluorescence  
644  Coverslips were thawed to room temperature and rinsed twice with 1X PBS to remove 
645  OCT. Sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (diluted in PBS) for 10 minutes 
646  at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed once with PBS at room temperature and 
647  blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 hours at 37°C in a humidified chamber. 
648  After rinsing with PBS, primary antibody (diluted in 1% BSA) was applied overnight at 4°C 
649  in a humidified chamber. The next day, sections were rinsed with 1X PBS 4 times and 
650  secondary antibody (diluted in 1% BSA) was applied for 2 hours at room temperature in 
651  a dark, humidified chamber. Sections were rinsed 4 times with 1X PBS and coverslips 
652  were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Gold. The following antibodies and dilutions 
653  were used for EGFP-CDHR2 mouse frozen section staining: anti-GFP (chicken Aves 
654  #GFP-1020), 1:200; anti-CDHR5 (rabbit, Sigma #HPA009173), 1:250; anti-ZO-1 clone 
655  R40.76 (rat, EMD Millipore Sigma #MABT11), 1:100; Alexa Fluor goat anti-chicken 488 
656  (Invitrogen  #A-11039),  1:1000;  Alexa  Fluor  F(ab’)2  fragment  goat  anti-rabbit  568 
657  (Invitrogen #A21069), 1:1000; Alexa Fluor goat anti-rat 647 (Invitrogen #A21247), 1:200; 
658  and Alexa Fluor Plus 405 Phalloidin (Invitrogen #A30104), 1:200 for actin staining. The 
659  secondary antibodies, not including phalloidin, were spun down for 10 minutes at 4°C and 
660  21 x g prior to using. 
661   
662  Cell Culture 
663  LLC-PK1-CL4 (porcine kidney proximal tubule) cells were grown in 1X high glucose 
664  DMEM containing 2mM L-glutamine (Corning #10-013-CV) supplemented with 1% L-
665  glutamine (Corning # 25-005-CI) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (R&D Systems) while 
666  CACO-2BBE (human colonic adenocarcinoma) cells were grown in the same medium but 
667  supplemented with 20% FBS. Cells were maintained in culture incubated at 37°C and 5%

668  CO2.  Cells  were  tested  for  mycoplasma  using  the  MycoAlert  PLUS  Mycoplasma 
669  Detection Kit (Lonza #LT07-710). 
670   
671  Cloning and Constructs 
672  A C terminally tagged pHALO-N3-CDHR2 (CDHR2-HALO) construct was generated by 
673  taking full length CDHR2 via PCR from pEGFP-N3-PCDH24 (CDHR2-EGFP) with the 
674  primers  CDHR2-Fwd:  ATGGCCCAGCTATGGCTG  and  CDHR2-Rev: 
675  CAGGTCCGTGGTGTCCAGG.    The  product  was  then  TOPO  cloned  into  the 
676  pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Invitrogen #K250020) and then placed into the pHALO-N3 
677  backbone, adapted for Gateway cloning using the Gateway conversion kit (Invitrogen 
678  #11828029). All other overexpression constructs listed in this paper were previously 
679  created and/or reported as noted in the key resources table. 
680   
681  Cell Line Generation 
682  Cells expressing one plasmid were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Promega #E2691) at a 
683  FuGENE:DNA (µL:µg) ratio of 3:1 following the reagent protocol in a T25 cell culture flask. 
684  The next day, all cells were split up to a T75 flask with the addition of 1mg/mL G418 
685  sulfate for antibiotic selection. Cells were maintained in culture under constant G418 
686  selection to create a stably expressing cell line. Cells co-expressing two plasmids were 
687  transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen #11668019) according to the 
688  manufacturer’s protocol. The next day, cells were split to plasma-cleaned 35mm glass 
689  bottom  dishes  (CellVis  #D35-20-1.5-N)  for  subsequent  imaging.  The  EGFP-
690  EPS8/mCherry-ESPN CL4 stable cell line was previously created [20] by transducing a 
691  G418-selected EGFP-EPS8 stable cell line with lentiviral mCherry-ESPN followed by 10 
692  µg/mL puromycin selection. See citation for detailed protocol. The Halo-CDHR2/EGFP-
693  CDHR5 co-expressing CL4 cells were a transient transfection, and not stably selected. 
694   
695  Cell Immunofluorescence 
696  Prior to fixation and staining, CL4 and CACO-2BBE cells were grown to n days post-
697  confluent (DPC) on acid-washed 22x22 mm #1.5H coverslips (Globe Scientific) in a 6-
698  well plate to a time point with apical polarity representative of their native tissue, 3 DPC

699  and 12 DPC, respectively. First, cells were rinsed in warm 1X PBS and fixed in 4% PFA 
700  for 15 minutes at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times, 5 minutes each, with 1X 
701  PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature. 5% 
702  BSA was added for 1 hour at 37°C as blocking solution. After rinsing with 1X PBS, primary 
703  antibody (diluted in 1% BSA) was added for 1 hour at 37°C. Labeling with primary 
704  antibody was followed by washing 4 times, 5 minutes each, with 1X PBS. Secondary 
705  antibody (diluted in 1% BSA) was then applied for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. 
706  After incubation in secondary antibody, cells were washed 4 times, 5 minutes each with 
707  1X PBS and coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold. The following 
708  antibodies  and  dilutions  were  used  for  cell  staining:  anti-PCLKC  (CDHR2)  (mouse, 
709  Abnova #H00054825-M01), 1:25; anti-CDHR5 (Rabbit, Sigma #HPA009173), 1:250; anti-
710  ZO-1 clone R40.76 in CL4 (rat, EMD Millipore Sigma #MABT11), 1:100; anti-ZO-1 in 
711  CACO-2BBE (rabbit, Invitrogen #61-7300), 1:50; Alexa Fluor F(ab’)2 fragment goat anti-
712  mouse 488 (Invitrogen #A11017) and goat anti-rabbit 568 (Invitrogen #A21069), 1:1000; 
713  Alexa Fluor goat anti-rat 647 (Invitrogen #A21247), 1:200; and Alexa Fluor Plus 405 
714  Phalloidin (Invitrogen # A30104) or Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen # A22287), 
715  1:200 for actin staining. The secondary antibodies, not including phalloidin, were spun 
716  down for 10 minutes at 4°C and 21 x g prior to using. 
717   
718  Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) 
719  Cells were spun down into a pellet and resuspended in “pre-sort medium” containing 
720  Phenol free 1X DMEM (Gibco #21063-029) plus 5% FBS, and 1% L-glutamine. Cells were 
721  sorted by Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Flow Cytometry Shared Resource on a 
722  5-Laser FACS Aria III system with a 100 µm sized nozzle. All fluorescent positive cells 
723  (Fig. S3) were deposited into a single well of a 6-well plate containing “post-sort medium” 
724  of 1X DMEM (Corning #10-013-CV) with Phenol red, 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 
725  10µL/mL anti-anti (Gibco #15240062). 24 hours post-sort, the media was changed to CL4 
726  culture media (as detailed in cell culture methods) and 1 mg/mL G418 was added for 
727  maintaining stable plasmid overexpression. Sorted cell lines were maintained in this 
728  media and under antibiotic selection.

730  Cell Mixing Experiments 
731  Fluorescently sorted CL4 cell populations were grown independently and under G418 
732  antibiotic selective pressure to ~80% confluence, trypsinized, and resuspended in CL4 
733  media to a density of ~850,000 cells/mL. 250 µL of each cell population were seeded in 
734  plasma-cleaned glass-bottom dishes or onto acid washed coverslips at a density of 
735  ~400,000 total cells at a mixing ratio of 1:1 (e.g. CDHR2-EGFP cells were mixed with 
736  CDHR5-mCherry cells). Immediately after seeding, cell populations were thoroughly 
737  mixed by pipette. Cells were grown to 3DPC for fixed cell staining or for 1 day for live cell 
738  imaging (FRAP). 
739   
740  Fixed Sample Microscopy 
741  Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon A1 microscope equipped 
742  with 488 nm, 568 nm, and 647 nm LASERs. Mixed CL4 cell populations for linescan 
743  analysis were imaged using a Plan Apo 40x/1.3 NA oil immersion objective. CACO-2BBE 
744  cells were imaged using an Apo TIRF 100x/1.49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective. 
745  Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) was used for imaging frozen tissue sections and 
746  fixed cells with a Nikon N-SIM equipped with 405, 488, 468, and 647 nm LASERs, an 
747  Andor DU-897 EMCCD camera, and a TIRF 100X/1.49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective. 
748  All SIM images were reconstructed using Nikon Elements software.  
749   
750  Live Imaging Microscopy 
751  Prior to live cell imaging, cells growing in 35mm glass bottom dishes were rinsed once 
752  with 1X DPBS (Corning #21-031-CV). FluoroBrite imaging media (Gibco #A18967-01) 
753  supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine was added to the dish. For CL4 cells 
754  expressing Halo-CDHR2, Janelia Fluor 635 dye (Janelia) was added to the FluoroBrite 
755  media at a concentration of 50 nM for 1 hour at 37°C immediately prior to imaging. 
756  Spinning  disk  confocal  microscopy  was  performed  using  a  Nikon  Ti2  inverted  light 
757  microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk head, a Photometrics Prime 95B or 
758  Hamamatsu Fusion BT sCMOS camera, and three excitation LASERs (488, 568 and 647 
759  nm). A 100X/1.49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective was used for all acquisitions. A stage 
760  incubator (Tokai Hit) maintained cells in a humidified environment at 37°C with 5% CO2.

761   
762  Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) 
763  A square ROI was drawn in Nikon Elements at marginal and/or medial microvilli regions. 
764  A stimulating 405 nm LASER controlled by a Bruker mini-scanner set at 70% power and 
765  a dwell time of 40 us was targeted to each ROI after the first 3 frames of the movie 
766  acquisition. Two ND time acquisitions were used for imaging fluorescence recovery at 
767  intervals of 15 s for 3 minutes, followed by intervals of 30 s for 10 minutes.  
768   
769  Electron Microscopy – CACO-2BBE and LLC-PK1-CL4 cells and tissue 
770  To prepare samples, cells were plated on glass coverslips washed once with warm SEM 
771  buffer (0.1M HEPES, pH 7.3) supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2, then fixed with 2.5% 
772  glutaraldehyde and then 4% paraformaldehyde in SEM buffer supplemented with 2mM 
773  CaCl2. Samples were washed in SEM buffer, then incubated in 1% tannic acid, washed 
774  with ddH2O, incubated with 1% OsO4, washed with ddH2O, incubated with 1% uranyl 
775  acetate, then washed with ddH2O. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. 
776  Sampels were then dried using critical point drying and mounted on aluminum stubs and 
777  coated with gold/palladium using a sputter coater. SEM imaging was performed using 
778  Quanta 250 Environmental-SEM operated in high vacuum mode with an accelerating 
779  voltage of 5–10 kV, or imaged on a Zeiss Crossbeam 550 at 2keV. All reagents were 
780  purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences. For more detailed methods, see [28]. 
781  TEM of mouse intestine (Fig. S1B) was performed as previously described [14] 
782   
783  Electron Microscopy – Crypt-villus axis 
784  For SEM imaging of intestinal sections, immediately after euthanasia, ~5 mm murine 
785  duodenal sections were quickly fixed in a large volume (10mL) of 2.5% glutaraldehyde 
786  and 4% paraformaldehyde in SEM buffer (described above). Sections were then washed 
787  in SEM buffer prior to embedding in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek #4583). 
788  To ensure stable support of the complex architecture within the explant lumens, samples 
789  were gently moved through 3 rounds of fresh OCT compound with gentle manipulation to 
790  ensure penetration of the OCT. Samples were then placed in cryomolds (with OCT) and 
791  frozen over a dry ice/ethanol slurry. Molds were stored at -80C once fully frozen. Frozen 
  33 

NEW PAGE

792  explants were subsequently sectioned on a Leica CM1950 crytostat at 50μm/section and 
793  melted onto stainless steel AFM specimen discs (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Next, 
794  explant  sections  and  disks  were  immersed  in  1%  OsO4,  washed  in  ddH2O,  then 
795  dehydrated through graded ethanol series. Of note, it was most common to experience 
796  detachment of the section from the AFM disk during the OsO4 and dehydration steps. 
797  Detached sections were recovered and gently adhered to an aluminum SEM specimen 
798  stub  via  conductive  adhesive  tab.  SEM  imaging  was  performed  on  a  Quanta  250 
799  environmental SEM, as described above. 
800   
801  Quantification and Statistical Analysis 
802  Microvilli  Orientation  Measurements.  In  Fiji,  the  first  frames  of  three  independent 
803  mCherry-ESPN CL4 cell movies were used for orientation measurements shown in Fig. 
804  2B. A thin, rectangular ROI (height 12 pixels) was drawn across 2+ cells to encompass 
805  both marginal and medial areas (sample ROI Fig 2A, dotted box). The ROI hyperstack 
806  was duplicated and 3D projected with rotation around the X axis. Using the Angle tool, a 
807  line was drawn down the length of each microvillus (dotted lines, Fig. 2B) with the angle 
808  base parallel to the cell surface (solid lines Fig. 2B). Angle measurements were plotted in 
809  Prism in a column chart and mean marginal and medial angles were compared using a 
810  Welch’s unpaired t-test.  
811   
812  Temporal Color Coding. Time frames for every 3 minutes were selected (18 total frames). 
813  Using the Temporal-Color Code function in Fiji, the ESPN channel was coded (start frame 
814  1, end frame 18) using the Spectrum LUT (Fig. 3B). 
815   
816  Microvilli tracking using EGFP-EPS8 puncta. Denoised and deconvolved 3D movies were 
817  converted into max intensity projections in the Z plane. Next, a binary via the spot 
818  detection tool was applied to the FITC channel (EPS8 signal) with a diameter of 260 nm 
819  and a contrast value of 25 to threshold EPS8 puncta representing individual microvilli in 
820  the ROI (medial or marginal). Tracking parameters did not allow for the detection of new 
821  tracks after the first frame, allowed for a maximum of 3 gaps in a given track, and a 
822  standard deviation multiplier of 2. Using the tracking tool, binaries, representing EPS8 
  34 

NEW PAGE

823  puncta, were tracked and any points lying outside of the ROI were deselected. Track data, 
824  time and X Y positions, were then exported to Excel and analyzed and plotted in Prism 
825  as radial X Y positions over time by subtracting each position in X or Y from the respective 
826  point position at time 0, making the first position (0,0) (Fig 3C and 3F). Three independent 
827  live cell imaging experiments were used for the analysis. 
828   
829  Mean Square Displacement. With the same X,Y EPS8 puncta trajectories described 
830  above, an Excel spreadsheet was used to calculate the mean square displacement of 
831  each tracked microvillus over 15 s intervals across 5 minutes as us and others have done 
832  previously [28, 49-51]. A line was fitted to each MSD curve using the simple linear 
833  regression model in Prism which provided the slopes presented on the plots in Fig. 3E 
834  and H.  
835   
836  Cell Mixing Linescans. Using Fiji, a segmented line with a width of 6 was drawn across 
837  mixed cell interfaces to encapsulate signal at the mixed cell (marginal) interfaces. Lines 
838  with a minimum length of 20 µm and maximum length of 75 µm were used in analysis. 
839  Fig. 5 shows one representative linescan from the large dataset for each cell mixing 
840  scenario, with line length (µm) shown on the X axis and mCherry and EGFP construct 
841  intensities on the Y axis. Intensities were normalized from 0 to 1 in Prism with 0 being the 
842  lowest gray value in the linescan and 1 being the highest. The residual plots shown were 
843  calculated from the respective representative linescan by subtracting mCherry intensity 
844  from EGFP intensity at each length in X. 30 individual linescans from each cell mixing 
845  scenario were plotted on their own XY correlation plot in Prism. Combined Pearson’s r 
846  values from the 30 individual correlations were plotted in Fig 5K, and mean r values were 
847  compared in Prism using an Ordinary one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons.  
848   
849  FRAP Fraction Recovery Analysis. A background ROI and reference ROI were used to 
850  account for photobleaching and background fluorescence in both channels. Fraction 
("#$%&'$(	*+,-"%&./0123()
851  recovery over time was calculated from  . Recovery curves were 
(*$5$0$3&$	*+,-"%&./0123()
852  fitted with a two-phase association equation in Prism and the immobile fraction was 
853  calculated  from  1  minus  the  plateau.  Images  shown  in  Fig.  6  were  denoised  and 
  35

857  Mean ESPN Intensity Measurements. In Nikon Elements, the movie was projected in Z 
858  to create a maximum intensity projection. For Fig. 7D, at 0 hr and 24 hr a ring ROI was 
859  drawn encompassing each marginal zone and separate circular ROI was drawn to 
860  encompass the medial zone of 10 cells. Mean mCherry-ESPN intensity was measured 
861  for each cell at the marginal and medial zones. Delta represents the change in mCherry-
862  ESPN mean intensity from the 0 hr time point to the 24 hr time point.
