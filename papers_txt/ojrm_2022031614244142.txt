sorption and retention properties allows a wound healing effect because such

various cell growth factors. The double-sided UV-irradiated sponge is a good 
candidate for the wound dressing. On the other hand, the single-sided UV- 
irradiated sponge is a good candidate for the hemostatic material.

1. Introduction 
The design of hemostatic material and wound dressing needs to understand the 
mechanism of wound healing [1]. In general, the events of wound healing are 
divided into four phases: vascular response, blood coagulation, inflammation 
and new tissue formation. As medical products related to blood coagulation, 
several types of hemostatic materials are commercially available. A typical he-
mostatic material is a fibrin adhesive. By the action of coagulation factors, fibri-
nogen is converted to fibrin and exerts tissue adhesion to stop bleeding. Another 
typical hemostatic material is sponge-shaped, sheet-shaped or cotton-like colla-
gen. Platelets are activated when they come into contact with collagen. Activated 
platelets promote platelet aggregation to form platelet thrombus. In addition, ac-
tivated platelets release coagulation factors. By the action of these factors, fibri-
nogen is converted to fibrin and exerts a hemostatic effect. These collagen-based 
hemostatic materials provide a place for blood coagulation and exert a hemos-
tatic effect. This hemostatic material is made from the collagen derived from 
cowhide that has the original fiber structure. Unfortunately, the antigenic de-
terminants of the collagen molecule have not been removed. Other hemostatic 
materials are gelatin sponge and cotton-like oxidized cellulose. These materials 
do not have a direct hemostatic effect. These materials absorb blood in the sponge 
or cotton-like structure and cause blood clotting. Commercially available hemos-
tatic materials are designed to promote blood coagulation, but not designed to 
promote new tissue formation. 
Regarding new tissue formation, several types of wound dressings composed 
of collagen (Col) have been developed and used in the field of plastic and recon-
structive surgery [2] [3] [4]. One of the excellent wound dressings is the sheet- 
shaped collagen sponge with a silicone film attached to the top surface [5]. This 
wound dressing is manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying a mixed aqueous so-
lution of fibrous Col and heat-denatured collagen (Col’), followed by thermal de-
hydration to introduce intermolecular crosslinks between collagen molecules. In 
the treatment of severe burns, this wound dressing is applied to deep tissue defect 
wounds after excision of necrotic tissue. The treatment with this wound dressing 
can form excellent transplant beds for autologous split-thickness skin grafts. In 
addition, several types of collagen-based wound dressings and cultured skin subs-
titutes have been used to prepare the wound bed for autologous split-thickness 
skin grafts [6] [7]. However, the importance of treatment for the wound surface 
caused by collecting autologous split-thickness skin has not been noticed. Such a 
shallow wound is thought to heal with regular wound dressings despite a lot of

bleeding. It is an important task to cleanly heal such a wound surface. Exactly, it 
is necessary to develop a covering material that has a hemostatic effect and a 
wound healing effect. 
It is well known that Col has an excellent hemostatic effect and an excellent 
wound healing effect [8] [9]. In the previous study [10], we designed collagen- 
based sponge devices for use in the field of oral surgery. These devices are the 
sheet-shaped collagen sponge to cover mucosal and gingival small tissue defect 
wounds. These sponges are manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying a mixed 
aqueous solution of Col and Col’, followed by UV irradiation to introduce in-
termolecular crosslinks between collagen molecules. The results of previous study 
showed that the sheet-shaped sponge composed of Col and Col’ with a composi-
tion ratio of 2/1 is the top candidate for the devises used in oral surgery. Based 
on these findings, we designed a large size sheet-shaped collagen sponge having a 
hemostatic effect and a wound healing effect for use in plastic and reconstructive 
surgery. Especially we focus on clean healing of bleeding wound surfaces caused by 
collecting autologous split-thickness skin. In addition, we focus on clean healing 
of facial trauma caused by traffic accidents and fall accidents. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Manufacture of Sheet-Shaped Collagen Sponge 
The sheet-shaped collagen sponge was manufactured by the method described in 
our previous article [10]. Purified granular collagen (Col) derived from porcine 
skin was purchased from Nippon Meat Packers (Osaka, Japan). Terror peptides 
of collagen molecule that are antigenic determinants have been removed by en-
zyme degradation. The sheet-shaped collagen sponge was manufactured as fol-
lows. Col (32 g) was dissolved in distilled water (4000 mL) to obtain Col aqueous 
solution (0.8 w/v%, pH2.8). Aside from this, Col (16g) was dissolved in distilled 
water (2000 mL) and then heated at 60˚C for 1 hour to obtain heat-denatured 
collagen aqueous solution (0.8 w/v%, pH2.8). This heat-denatured collagen is 
referred to as Col’. The Col aqueous solution was mixed with the Col’ aqueous 
solution by stirring and then adjusted to the conditions of pH4.5 by dropping 
sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. This clear mixture (20 mL) was poured into 
a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm) and refrigerated at 4˚C for 6 hours or more, and 
then was frozen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum drying to 
obtain a sheet-shaped sponge. These sponges are referred to as Sponge-CC’21. 
The composition ratio of Col and Col’ is 2/1. The surface of sponge was irra-
diated using a 15 W ultraviolet lamp with a wavelength of 253.7 nm at a distance 
of 20 cm to introduce crosslinks between collagen molecules. Both surfaces of 
the sponge were treated with UV irradiation for 10, 15 and 20 minutes. They were 
named as Sponge-CC’21-10x2, Sponge-CC’21-15x2 and Sponge-CC’21-20x2. These 
are double-sided UV-irradiated sponges. One surface of the sponge was treated 
with UV irradiation for 10, 15 and 20 minutes. They were named as Sponge- 
CC’21-10x1, Sponge-CC’21-15x1 and Sponge-CC’21-20x1. These are single-sided

UV-irradiated sponges. 
2.2. Weight Change of Collagen Sponge When Immersed in Water 
The weight change of Sponge-CC’21 was investigated as follows. The sponge was 
immersed in a plastic container filled with distilled water (200 mL) and then this 
container was placed in an incubator at 37˚C for a predetermined time. The hy-
drated sponges were collected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh after 
immersion in water for 3 hour, 6 hour, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days and then 
returned to a plastic tray (80 mm × 50 mm). These hydrated sponges were fro-
zen at −85˚C overnight and followed by freeze-vacuum drying to obtain dry 
sponges. The weight of the dry sponge was measured and compared with the 
original weight before immersion in water. This experiment was performed us-
ing 8 containers. The average value was calculated by measuring the weight of 
each dry sponge collected from each container. 
2.3. Water Absorption and Retention Properties   
of Collagen Sponge 
The water absorption and retention properties of Sponge-CC’21 were investi-
gated as follows. The sponge was immersed in a plastic container filled with dis-
tilled water (200 mL) at 37˚C. After 10 minutes, the hydrated sponge was col-
lected using a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh and then placed on this mesh for 
30 minutes to remove excess water and then weighed. This hydrated sponge 
placed on the mesh was put in the plastic container and then this container was 
placed in an incubator at 37˚C. The hydrated sponge placed on the mesh was 
taken out as it was and weighed at predetermined time intervals. This experi-
ment was performed using 8 containers. The average value was calculated by 
measuring the weight of each hydrated sponge. 
2.4. Enzymatic Degradation of Collagen Sponge by Collagenase 
Collagenase powder was purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Cor-
poration (Osaka, Japan). The enzymatic degradation of Sponge-CC’21 by colla-
genase was investigated as follows. Collagenase (32 mg or 64 mg) was dissolved 
in distilled water (1600 mL). The enzyme concentration was adjusted to 0.002 
w/v% or 0.004 w/v%. The weight change of each sponge was investigated by 
immersing a sponge in each plastic container filled with distilled water contain-
ing collagenase (200 mL) and then placing it in an incubator at 37˚C for a speci-
fied period of time. These hydrated sponges were collected using a 10-mesh size 
stainless steel mesh after immersion for 3 days and then returned to a plastic tray 
(80 mm × 50 mm). These hydrated sponges were frozen at −85˚C overnight and 
followed by freeze-vacuum drying to obtain dry sponges. The weight of dry 
sponge was measured and compared with its original weight before immersion 
in water. This experiment was performed using 8 containers. The average value 
was calculated by measuring the weight of each dry sponge collected from each 
container.

2.5. Statistical Evaluation 
Data were expressed as means ± standard error. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Student’s t-test for comparison between two groups. Each experi-
ment was performed 8 times to examine statistically significant differences in the 
measured values (n = 8). 
3. Result 
3.1. Manufacture of Sheet-Shaped Collagen Sponge 
The important key in the manufacturing process is how to prepare a clear mixed 
aqueous solution of Col and Col’ [10]. The Col aqueous solution (pH 2.8) preci-
pitates when the pH value reaches 4 under 25˚C conditions. On the other hand, 
the Col’ aqueous solution does not precipitate even in the neutral pH range. The 
mixed aqueous solution of Col and Col’ with a composition ratio of 2/1 partially 
precipitates when the pH value reaches 5 or higher under 25˚C conditions. There-
fore, this mixture was adjusted at pH4.5 to maintain transparency. The sheet- 
shaped collagen sponge was manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying this clear 
mixed solution. The sponge has a size of 80 mm × 50 mm and a thickness of 3 
mm. The both sides or one side of sponge was treated with UV irradiation. The 
sponge slightly turns yellow when the UV irradiation time is 20 minutes or 
more. The shape of collagen sponge does not change when immersed in water 
(Figure 1(A)). The hydrated sponge has moderate physical properties that can 
be easily collected using a stainless steel mesh and placed on the mesh (Figure 
1(B)). Such properties are suitable for use as a hemostatic material and a wound 
dressing. It is an advantage that the sheet-shaped collagen sponge can maintain 
its hydrated shape when placed on the wound surface.

3.2. Weight Change of Collagen Sponge When Immersed in Water 
It is important that collagen sponge is biodegraded and absorbed by the time 
new tissue formation is completed. As an in vitro experiment, the weight change 
of collagen sponge when immersed in water was investigated. The weight change 
of collagen sponge when immersed in water is related to the degree of crosslinks 
between collagen molecules. The degree of crosslinks is related to UV irradiation 
time. Fist, the weight change of the collagen sponge treated with UV irradiation 
for 10 minutes was examined. The weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-10x2 
measured after immersion in water for 3 hours, 6 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days was 
90%, 86%, 82%, 79%, 78% and 74% of the original weight before immersion in 
water, respectively. On the other hand, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21- 
10x1 measured after immersion in water for 3 hours, 6 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days 
was 86%, 79%, 71%, 57%, 54% and 54% of the original weight before immersion 
in water, respectively (Figure 2). Second, the weight change of the collagen sponge 
treated with UV irradiation for 15 minutes was examined. The weight change 
rate of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 measured after immersion in water for 3 hours, 6 
hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days was 91%, 86%, 85%, 83%, 80% and 77% of the original 
weight before immersion in water, respectively. On the other hand, the weight 
change rate of Sponge-CC’21-15x1 measured after immersion in water for 3 
hours, 6 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days was 88%, 78%, 75%, 69%, 65% and 63% of the 
original weight before immersion in water, respectively (Figure 3). Third, the 
weight change of the sponge treated with UV irradiation for 20 minutes was 
examined. The weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-20x2 measured after im-
mersion in water for 3 hours, 6 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days was 88%, 88%, 86%, 
83%, 82% and 79% of the original weight before immersion in water, respective-
ly. On the other hand, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-20x1 measured

after immersion in water for 3 hours, 6 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days was 85%, 82%, 
66%, 59%, 55% and 52% of the original weight before immersion in water, re-
spectively (Figure 4). 
The double-sided UV-irradiated sponge showed very slow elution properties. 
On the other hand, the single-sided UV-irradiated sponge showed initially fast 
elution and subsequent very slow elution properties. This phenomenon is con-
sidered to be due to the initially fast elution of collagen molecules from the sur-
face without UV-irradiation. This fast elution of collagen molecules allows adhe-
sion of the collagen sponge to the wound surface and results in hemostatic effect.

In case of double-sided UV-irradiated sponges, the crosslinks between collagen 
molecules was successfully introduced with UV irradiation time of 10 minutes or 
more. The weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 was 77% of the original 
weight even after immersion in water for 7 days. In case of single-sided UV-irra- 
diated sponges, the crosslinks between collagen molecules was best introduced 
with a UV irradiation time of 15 minutes. The weight change rate of Sponge- 
CC’21-15x1 was 63% of the original weight even after immersion in water for 7 
days (Figure 5). On the other hand, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21- 
20x1 was 52% of the original weight after immersion in water for 7 days. Optim-
al UV irradiation time is required because UV irradiation induces intermolecu-
lar crosslinks but causes molecular damage. 
3.3. Water Absorption and Retention Properties   
of Collagen Sponge 
It is important that the collagen sponge has high water absorption and retention 
properties. In clinical use, it is a great advantage to be able to absorb a large 
amount of blood plasma and exudates containing various cell growth factors. In 
addition to that, being able to maintain a moist environment is also a great ad-
vantage to promote wound healing. For this reason, the water absorption and 
retention properties of Sponge-CC’21 were examined as follows. The hydrated 
sponge was placed on a 10-mesh size stainless steel mesh and then its weight was 
measured at predetermined time intervals. First, the weight of hydrated Sponge- 
CC’21-10x2 was 79, 54, 52, 50, 40 and 25 times that of the dry sponge after 30 
minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively. The weight of hydrated Sponge-

CC’21-10x1 was 80, 46, 39, 33, 26 and 19 times that of the dry sponge after 30 
minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively (Figure 6). Second, the weight of hy-
drated Sponge-CC’21-15x2 was 81, 63, 62, 60, 56 and 45 times that of the dry 
sponge after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively. The weight of hy-
drated Sponge-CC’21-15x1 was 80, 55, 51, 47, 43 and 39 times that of the dry 
sponge after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively (Figure 7). Third, the 
weight of hydrated Sponge-CC’21-20x2 was 83, 62, 57, 55, 52 and 47 times that 
of the dry sponge after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively. The weight 
of hydrated Sponge-CC’21-20x1 was 83, 55, 50, 46, 41 and 35 times that of the 
dry sponge after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively (Figure 8).

The single-sided UV-irradiated sponges partially dissolve in the water absorbed 
in the sponge and flow out under the mesh. The single-sided UV-irradiated 
sponges showed a lower value in water retention than the double-sided UV-irra- 
diated sponges. Despite such collagen elution, the weight of hydrated Sponge- 
CC’21-15x1 was 39 times that of the dry sponge even after 7 days (Figure 9). 
Such high water absorption and long-term water retention properties are suita-
ble for use as a covering material with a hemostatic effect and a wound healing 
effect.

3.4. Enzymatic Degradation of Sponge by Collagenase 
It is important that collagen sponge is biodegraded and absorbed by the time 
new tissue formation is completed. As an in vitro experiment, the enzymatic de-
gradation properties of collagen sponge by collagenase were investigated (Figure 
10). As comparison data, the weight change rates of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 and 
Sponge-CC’21-15x1 when immersed in water for 3 day were 83% and 69% of the 
original weight, respectively. On the contrary, the weight change rates of Sponge- 
CC’21-15x2 and Sponge-CC’21-15x1 when immersed in water containing colla-
genase (0.002 w/v%) for 3 day were 81% and 59% of the original weight, respec-
tively. In addition, the weight change rates of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 and Sponge- 
CC’21-15x1 when immersed in water containing collagenase (0.004 w/v%) for 3 
day were 80% and 53% of the original weight, respectively. These results suggest 
that the intermolecular crosslinks in these collagen sponges can effectively delay 
enzymatic degradation by collagenase. Such biological properties are suitable for 
as a covering material with a hemostatic effect and a wound healing effect. It is 
expected that Sponge-CC’21-15x2 and Sponge-CC’21-15x1 is biodegraded and 
absorbed by the time new tissue formation is completed. 
4. Discussion 
In the previous study [10], we designed collagen-based sponge devices for use in 
the field of oral surgery. These sponges are the small size sheet-shaped collagen

sponge to cover mucosal and gingival defect wounds in oral surgery. In this 
study, we designed a large size sheet-shaped collagen sponge for use in the field 
of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The target is the sheet-shaped collagen 
sponge to cover acute wounds. In the treatment of severe burns, autologous 
split-thickness skin grafting is performed. The treatment of the wound surface 
caused by collecting split-thickness skin requires a covering material that has a 
hemostatic effect and a wound healing effect. Another target is the sheet-shaped 
collagen sponge to cover outer surface wounds. Multiple trauma injuries are 
mainly due to traffic accidents and fall accidents and often associated with facial 
trauma. The treatment of these facial wounds also requires a covering material 
that has a hemostatic effect and a wound healing effect. What should be empha-
sized is the following. The wound healing process should proceed smoothly and 
result in minimal scar formation. The most important task is to heal the wound 
cleanly. Exactly, it is necessary to develop a covering material that has a hemos-
tatic effect and a wound healing effect. 
The method of introducing crosslinks between collagen molecules by UV ir-
radiation allows the design of unique structures. When both surfaces of sheet- 
shaped sponge are treated with UV irradiation, the both outer layer is sufficient-
ly cross-linked, while the intermediate layer is insufficiently cross-linked because 
UV rays do not reach the intermediate layer. When only upper surface of sponge 
is irradiated with UV, the upper layer is sufficiently cross-linked, but the lower 
layer is not cross-linked. 
In this study, we investigated the characteristics of the double-sided UV-irra- 
diated collagen sponge and the single-sided UV-irradiated collagen sponge. 
First, the elution properties of collagen molecules from the sponge were examined. 
It is thought that some collagen molecules in the intermediate layer gradually 
dissolved in water when the double-sided UV-irradiated sponge was immersed 
in water. As a typical example, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 
was 77% of the original weight even after immersion in water for 7 days. This 
sponge showed very slow elution properties. From such characteristics, Sponge- 
CC’21-15x2 is considered to be suitable as a wound dressing. On the other hand, 
it is thought that collagen molecules in the lower layer easily dissolved in water 
when the single-sided UV-irradiated sponge was immersed in water. Despite 
such elution of collagen molecules, the weight change rate of Sponge-CC’21- 
15x1 was 63% of the original weight even after immersion in water for 7 days. 
Such elution properties are due to sufficient cross-linking of the upper layer. This 
sponge showed the initially fast elution of collagen molecules from the sponge 
surface without UV-irradiation. This fast elution of collagen molecules allows ad-
hesion of the collagen sponge to the wound surface and results in hemostatic ef-
fect. From such characteristics, Sponge-CC’21-15x1 is considered to be suitable as 
a hemostatic material. When the single-sided UV-irradiated collagen sponge is 
attached on a wound surface, a part of collagen sponge can dissolve quickly in 
blood plasma and exudates and results in adhesiveness onto a wound surface. At

the same time, a fibrin network is formed, resulting in a hemostatic effect (Figure 
11). 
Second, the water absorption and retention properties of the collagen sponges 
were examined. The double-sided UV-irradiated collagen sponges and the sin-
gle-sided UV-irradiated collagen sponges can absorb about 80 times more wa-
ter than the own weight. As a typical example, the weight of hydrated Sponge- 
CC’21-15x2 was 45 times that of the dry sponge even after placing on the mesh 
for 7 days. Similarly, the weight of hydrated Sponge-CC’21-15x1 was 39 times 
that of the dry sponge even after placing on the mesh for 7 days. These high wa-
ter absorption and long-term water retention properties are suitable for use as a 
covering material with a hemostatic effect and a wound healing effect. 
Third, the biological properties of the collagen sponges were examined by 
immersing a sponge in water containing collagenase under the condition of 
0.002 w/v% and 0.004 w/v%. The weight of Sponge-CC’21-15x2 reduced slightly. 
On the other hand, the weight of Sponge-CC’21-15x1 reduced at a moderate 
rate. As a basic design, the sheet-shaped collagen sponge should be biodegraded 
by the time new tissue formation is completed. Too slow biodegradation is a 
physical obstacle to new tissue formation. The double-sided UV-irradiated col-
lagen sponge is thought to be able to maintain its structure for 2 weeks or more 
in clinical use. Therefore, Sponge-CC’21-15x2 is considered to be suitable as a 
wound dressing. The single-sided cross-linked collagen sponge allows initially 
fast elution of collagen molecules from the surface without UV irradiation. 
However, this sponge is thought to be able to maintain its structure for at least a 
week in clinical use. Therefore, Sponge-CC’21-15x1 is considered to be suitable 
as a hemostatic material. In actual use, the single-sided UV-irradiated collagen 
sponge is used to attach the surface without UV irradiation to the wound surface.

In case of the double-sided UV-irradiated collagen sponge, both sides can be ap-
plied to the wound surface. The conventional treatment is to attach the sheet- 
shaped collagen sponge to the wound surface and fix it with conventional non- 
stickiness gauze. 
More effective treatment can be considered. In the previous study [11], we 
examined the properties of the sheet-shaped hyaluronic acid (HA) sponge con-
taining epidermal growth factor (EGF). In the experiment of the previous study, 
the cultured dermal substitute was prepared by incorporating human skin fi-
broblasts into collagen gels. To make a wound surface model, this cultured der-
mal substitute was elevated to the air-culture medium interface. The HA sponge 
containing EGF was placed on this wound surface model. The incorporated EGF 
increased the production of vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte 
growth factor from fibroblasts in the cultured dermal substitute. Both growth 
factors have the effect of promoting wound angiogenesis. In addition to that, 
EGF itself has the effect of promoting epidermis formation [12]. In addition to 
them, HA itself has a wound healing effect [13]. The more effective treatment is 
to attach the sheet-shaped collagen sponge such as Sponge-CC’21-15x2 to the 
wound surface, and attach a HA sponge containing EGF on it, and then fix these 
sponges with conventional non-stickiness gauze. We look for such a more effec-
tive treatment in the next study. 
5. Conclusion 
The sheet-shaped collagen sponge was manufactured by freeze-vacuum drying 
the aqueous solution of Col and Col’ at a composition ratio of 2/1. Double-sides 
or single-side of the sponge was treated with UV irradiation for 15 minutes to 
introduce crosslinks between collagen molecules. As a basic design, the sheet- 
shaped collagen sponge should be biodegraded and absorbed by the time new 
tissue formation is completed in clinical use. The double-sided UV-irradiated col-
lagen sponge, Sponge-CC’21-15x2 is a good candidate for the wound dressing to 
cover a deep wound surface. On the other hand, the single-sided UV-irradiated 
collagen sponge, Sponge-CC’21-15x1 is a good candidate for the hemostatic ma-
terial to cover a shallow wound surface with significant bleeding.
