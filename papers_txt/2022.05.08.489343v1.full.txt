Abstract 
Limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), caused by mutations in 29 different genes, are the fourth 
most prevalent group of genetic muscle diseases, leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of the 
skeletal muscles. Although the link between LGMD and their genetic origins has been determined, 
LGMD still represent an unmet medical need. In this paper, we describe a platform for modeling 
LGMD based on the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Thanks to the self-renewing 
and pluripotency properties of hiPSC, this platform provides an alternative and renewable source of 
skeletal muscle cells (skMC) to primary, immortalized or overexpressing cells. We report that skMC 
derived from hiPSC express the majority of the genes and proteins causing LGMD. As a proof of 
concept, we demonstrate the importance of this cellular model for studying LGMDR9 by evaluating 
disease-specific phenotypes in skMC derived from hiPSC obtained from four patients. 
Keywords: limb girdle muscular dystrophies, induced pluripotent stem cells, skeletal muscle cells, 
pathological modeling.

Introduction 
Limb  girdle  muscular  dystrophies  (LGMD)  refer  to  a  heterogeneous  group  of  rare  genetic 
neuromuscular  diseases,  leading  to  progressive  weakness  and  wasting  of  proximal  pelvic  and 
shoulder girdle muscles 1–3. Fourth most common group of muscular dystrophies with an estimated 
prevalence of 1.63 per 100,000 people 4, LGMD subtypes are caused by genetic alterations of various 
genes playing a critical role in muscle function, maintenance and repair 5,6. Since the first LGMD gene 
identification reported in 1995 7, the number LGMD subtypes has grown to a total of 29 according to 
the last revised nomenclature 8. Classified according their inheritance pattern, LGMD subtypes are 
autosomal dominant (LGMD D) or autosomal recessive (LGMD R) types affecting 27 different proteins 
of the nucleus,  sarcoplasm, sarcomere, sarcolemma, and extracellular matrix (Table S1). While 
several gene replacement therapies 9–14 have been proposed over the years, no curative treatment is 
currently available for any types of LGMD.  
Over the  past decade, considerable  efforts have been  reported  for deciphering the molecular 
mechanisms associated with LGMD. Understanding the multiple molecular pathways associated with 
LGMD requires the development of appropriate cellular and animal models that at least partially 
recapitulate the characteristics of these diseases. Animal models are currently preferred to in vitro 
models for studies on muscular dystrophies 15,16 and the assessment of therapeutic strategies 17. 
However, although most of these animal models recapitulate the pathological phenotypes observed 
in humans, some of these models appear relatively normal or with a mild dystrophic phenotype 18, or 
even present impairments that are not reported in patients 19. Alternatively, over the past decades, 
several in vitro human models have been developed to study phenotypes associated with LGMD. 
Among  these,  primary  skeletal  muscle  cells  (skMC)  from  muscle  biopsies  represent  the  most 
commonly reported biological resource, despite the difficulty of their generation and their limited 
proliferative capacity 20. To overcome these issues, several in vitro models were developed through 
transdifferentiation  of  non-muscle  cells  into  skeletal  cells  by  forced  expression  of  myogenic 
transcription factors 21. More recently, immortalization of primary cells with hTERT and CDK4 was 
reported as successful for modeling LGMD 22,23, including LGMDD4/R1 24, LGMDR2 25–27 and LGMDR12 
28. While these different models present several advantages in terms of proliferation and maturity, 
the development of transgene-free cellular models from non-invasive procedures was proposed 
through the use of pluripotent stem cells.  
Derived from embryos 29–32 or generated through reprogramming 33,34, pluripotent stem cells have 
the unique capacity to unlimitedly self-renew and differentiate into any cell type in the organism 35. 
Over the years, thanks to the development of efficient protocols of differentiation for a growing 
number of cell types, embryonic stem cells (ES) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)

have been reported as efficient alternative models to primary or genetically modified cells. Since 
their discovery in humans, in 1998 and 2007, the use of these cells has been explored for a broad 
range  of  applications,  leading  to  the  identification  of  new  molecular  mechanisms  36,37,  new 
pathological phenotypes 38–41 and the development of new therapies 42–45 (reviewed in Karagiannis et 
al., 2019) 46. Although successfully applied for a number of genetic diseases, pathological modeling 
using pluripotent stem cells remained challenging for application to muscular disorders over almost a 
decade because of the lack of protocols for generating homogeneous populations of myotubes. Since 
2012, several studies have reported methods to overcome this limitation by differentiating hiPSC into 
myogenic cells using transgene-based methods 47–49 or small molecules recapitulating developmental 
myogenesis 50–57. Among these protocols, Caron et al. described a three-step process that efficiently 
differentiates hiPSC into mature skMC in less than 26 days using combinations of small molecules 
and  growth  factors  identified  by  high-throughput  screening.  Recently,  several  studies  have 
highlighted the use of human pluripotent stem cells, and more particularly hiPSC, for studying 
neuromuscular disorders 58–62, including LGMD 49,63–66. In the present study, we report that hiPSC-
derived skMC provide a reliable and robust in vitro tool for investigating LGMD subtypes. To do so, 
we used a robust protocol of differentiation to generate pure populations of skeletal myoblasts 
(skMb) and terminally differentiated myotubes (skMt) from hiPSC 51. Taking advantage of this model, 
we monitored and characterized the expression and localization of all the genes and proteins causing 
LGMD subtypes. As a proof of concept, such a cellular model was used to model LGMDR9 by 
analyzing alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) glycosylation in fukutin-related protein (FKRP)-deficient skMt 
derived from the hiPSC of four patients.  
 
Results 
Generation and characterization of skeletal muscle cells from human induced-pluripotent stem 
cells. The workflow to generate skeletal myoblasts cells (skMb) and multinucleated myotubes (skMt) 
from hiPSC is represented in Figure 1A. First, pluripotency capacities of three healthy hiPSC lines 
(WT1,2,3)  were  characterized  by  analyzing  the  expression  of  Oct4  and  Nanog  through 
immunostaining (Figure 1B) and quantifying SSEA4/TRA1-80 by flow cytometry (Figure S1). Myogenic 
differentiation was then induced using a 3-step protocol of differentiation 51. Briefly, SKM01 medium 
was used for 10 days to initiate the differentiation of hiPSC into myogenic precursors before their 
maturation into myoblasts in SKM02 medium and their terminal differentiation into myotubes in 
SKM03 medium. To demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this protocol of differentiation, 
MyoD and desmin expressions were assessed by immunostaining in skMb, showing homogeneity of 
labeling (Figure 1C). Terminal differentiation of skMt was then characterized by measuring the

expression  of myogenin and titin by immunostaining (Figure 1D). To  quantify gene expression 
changes  throughout  the  differentiation  protocol,  the  same  markers  were  monitored  by  qPCR, 
revealing, on the one hand, a significant time dependent decrease of Oct4 and Nanog in skMb and 
skMt compared to hiPSC (Figure 1E) and, on the other hand, a significant induction of MyoD, desmin, 
MyoG and titin in skMb and skMt (Figures 1F and 1G).  
To  further  characterize  the  terminal  differentiation  of  skMt  derived  from  hiPSC  and  visualize 
sarcomeric structure formation in real time, we then used two gene-edited hiPSC lines expressing 
titin (TTN) or troponin I (TNN) proteins fused to GFP (AICS-48 and AIC-37). After having validated 
their pluripotency capacities by measuring the expression of SSEA4/TRA1-80 using flow cytometry 
(Figure S2A), TTN-GFP and TNN-GFP hiPSC were differentiated using the same protocol. Analysis by 
qPCR  confirmed  the  efficient  myogenic  differentiation  of  these  cells  by  showing  a  significant 
decrease of Oct4 and Nanog expression in skMb and skMt compared to undifferentiated hiPSC 
(Figure S2B) and a significant increase of MyoD, desmin, MyoG and titin in skMb and skMt (Figure 
S2B). Terminal differentiation of TTN-GFP and TNN-GFP skMt was then followed in real time using a 
time-lapse analysis of GFP expression from Day 0 to Day 7 (Movie S1 and S2). Confocal microscopy 
analysis of GFP expression and localization in skMt derived from these two hiPSC cell lines revealed 
the appearance of GFP in both cell lines from Day 3 onwards (Figure 2A). Quantification of GFP 
positive cells showed that half of the cells expressed GFP from Day 3 of maturation and up to 80% at 
Day 5 (Figures 2B and 2C). Organization of the sarcomeric structures in skMt was further analyzed by 
characterizing the Z-disk, I-band and M-line using specific antibodies, as shown in Figure 2D. Confocal 
analysis of immunostaining and the GFP signal was performed in TTN-GFP skMt (Figure 2E) and TNN-
GFP skMt (Figure S2C), revealing a regular, transverse and repetitive organization of sarcomeres. 
Finally, quantification of TTN-GFP skMt presenting a striated pattern revealed a time dependent 
maturation from 40% at Day 2 to 80% at Day 5 (Figure 2F).  
Characterization of LGMD genes and proteins in skMt derived from hiPSC. Mutations in 27 genes 
are reported to cause 29 distinct LGMD (Table 1). Expression of these 27 genes was measured by 
qPCR in skMt derived from three healthy hiPSC lines (WT1,2,3) and myotubes derived from four 
healthy immortalized myoblast cell lines  (C25,  AB678,  AB1079, AB1167)  (Figure  3). Given that 
collagen type 6 is composed of three genetic components, alpha 1 to alpha 3 chains, three genes 
were monitored for this LGMD subtype, resulting in a total of 29 genes measured by gene expression 
in these two sources of myotubes. Analysis of this qPCR revealed similar levels of expression for the 
majority of these genes, both in skMt and immortalized myotubes: DNAJB6, TNPO3, HNRNPDL, 
CAPN3, COL6A3, DYSF, SGCB, SGCG, SGCD, TCAP, TRIM32, POMT1, FKTN, POMT2, DAG1, TRAPPC11, 
GMPPB and POGLUT1. Among these 29 genes, 2 genes revealed significant differences (10x fold

change): on the one hand, ANO5, that was upregulated in skMt and, on the other hand, LAMA2, that 
was significantly upregulated in immortalized myotubes.  
We then evaluated the expression of the corresponding proteins by immunostaining in skMt derived 
from one representative control hiPSC line (Figure 4). Confocal analysis of the expression of the 
dystrophin-associated  glycoprotein  complex  (DGC)  components  revealed  positive  staining  of 
dystroglycan 1 (DAG1) and beta, delta, gamma sarcoglycans (SGCB, SGCD and SGCG), while the alpha 
subunit (SGCA) was not detected in skMt. Analysis of sarcomeric components showed positive 
expression and localization within sarcomeres of calpain-3 (CAPN3), telethonin (TCAP) and titin 
(TTN), while a more diffuse, cross-striated pattern of plectin (PLEC) was also detected in skMt. We 
then evaluated the expression of proteins involved in DG glycosylation. Immunostaining of POMT2, 
POGLUT1 and FKRP showed a punctiform perinuclear localization of proteins, while localization was 
cytoplasmic for POMGnt1 and 2, POMT1, FKTN, GMPPB and ISPD. Regarding the proteins involved in 
trafficking, analysis of dysferlin expression by immunostaining revealed the presence of the protein 
at the plasma membrane and also in the cytoplasm of skMt, whereas TNPO3 and TRAPPC11 labeling 
was cytoplasmic. Staining of DNAJB6 resulted in a signal in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas 
that of anoctamin 5 (ANO5/TMEM16E) and tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32) revealed 
a punctiform signal in the cytoplasm. With regard to the nuclear HNRNPDL protein, staining was 
observed in the nucleus of skMt, as expected. Finally, analysis of the extracellular matrix proteins 
performed in non-permeabilized condition confirmed the presence of laminin-2 (LAMA2) in the 
sarcolemma. Immunostaining of collagen-6 alpha subunits 1, 2 and 3 (COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3) 
revealed a punctiform signal across skMt. Altogether, qPCR and immunostaining data show that 
hiPSC-derived skMt express the majority of LGMD genes at a comparable level to immortalized 
myotubes and that the related encoded proteins are present in the expected cellular compartment. 
Derivation and characterization of skMt from FKRP-deficient hiPSC. As a proof of concept, we then 
investigated the pathological features of LGMDR9 using hiPSC. To do so, an hiPSC cell line from one 
patient was provided by  the LGMD2I Research  Fund and three additional  hiPSC lines carrying 
mutations in the FKRP gene were generated by reprogramming patient cells. Pluripotency of the four 
LGMDR9 hiPSC lines was confirmed by measuring the expression of Oct4 and Nanog using qPCR 
(Figure S3A) and immunostaining (Figure 5A). Pluripotency status of these hiPSC lines was also 
validated by measuring the expression of SSEA4 and TRA1-80 using flow cytometry (Figure S3B). 
Finally, chromosomal stability was analyzed using the multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-
FISH) technique, revealing the absence of significant abnormalities (Figure S3C). Following this quality 
control assessment, the four FKRP-deficient hiPSC lines were further differentiated into skMb and 
skMt and compared to one representative healthy hiPSC line. Molecular characterization of skMb

derived from FKRP-deficient hiPSC revealed no difference from the healthy skMb in terms of MyoD 
expression (Figure S4A). FKRP-deficient skMb were secondarily differentiated into skMt, showing 
positive sarcomeric staining for myosin heavy chain (MHC), titin and α-actinin (Figures 5B and S4B) 
suggesting that the absence of FKRP does not affect either the initial or the terminal stages of 
differentiation. Analysis of α-DG glycosylation was then performed by immunostaining in FKRP-
deficient skMt and compared to the representative healthy relatives. Confocal analyses of IIH6 
staining  revealed  the  absence  of  a  glycosylated  α-DG  signal  in  the  FKRP1  line 
(V300A/A321E mutation), but not in the other cell lines (FKRP2,3,4), when compared to the healthy 
control (Figure 5B). This result was subsequently confirmed by western blot, showing that IIH6 
staining was decreased in the same cell line (Figure 5C). 
 
Discussion 
The main result of this study is the demonstration that myotubes derived from hiPSC can be used as 
a common biological resource to study a variety of LGMD. Following terminal differentiation, we 
reveal here that skMt are sufficiently mature to express the majority of LGMD-causing genes, as well 
as their related encoded proteins, comparably to immortalized myotubes obtained from muscle 
biopsies. As a proof of concept study, we further demonstrated that skMt derived from FKRP-
deficient hiPSC express the hallmark of LGMDR9 in function of their mutations. Altogether, our 
results demonstrate that hiPSC represent a valuable unlimited resource for modeling LGMD and 
assessing in vitro efficacy of future LGMD therapies. 
While similar in terms of clinical features, LGMD represent a highly heterogeneous group of diseases. 
Despite the high number of clinical or molecular studies of LGMD subtypes, our current knowledge of 
the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases poses many challenges. In this context, the 
development of a common cellular platform to compare pathological pathways in multiple LGMD 
would provide a major step forward in their comprehension. So far, hiPSC have been used to explore 
individual LGMD 64,66, but no studies have documented the possibility of using these cells for all types 
of LGMD. A first study using hiPSC to model one LGMD was reported in 2013 49. In this proof of 
concept study, the authors  showed that LGMD-R2 hiPSC-derived  myotubes obtained by stable 
genomic MyoD1 induction exhibited a defective membrane repair capacity following laser lesion that 
was rescued by full-length dysferlin gene transfer. More recently, El-Battrawy et al. 63 explored ion 
channel dysfunctions in cardiomyocytes derived from LGMDR9 hiPSC and successfully identified a 
significant reduction of  systolic  and diastolic intracellular calcium concentrations  in  those cells 
compared to healthy cells. In our study, we explored the possibility of going further by using hiPSC 
derivatives to model all LGMD genetic subtypes. To do so, we first evaluated the level of expression

of all the genes causing LGMD and related proteins in myotubes differentiated from healthy hiPSC. 
qPCR  and  immunostaining  data  revealed  that  the  majority  of  these  genes  and  proteins  were 
expressed in hiPSC-derived skMt at similar levels to primary myotubes. Beyond the overview of the 
LGMD that can be studied using hiPSC, this result suggests the use of hiPSC-derived skMt as a 
platform to improve our understanding of common pathways or phenotypes of several LGMD in a 
unique cellular model. 
As a proof of concept, we then generated and studied hiPSC carrying several mutations of the 
FKRP gene. Genetic variants in the FKRP gene cause a broad spectrum of phenotypes in LGMDR9 
patients 67, ranging from mild muscle weakness and atrophy to more severe symptoms with loss of 
ambulation, dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory 68 and mental impairment 69. From a molecular 
perspective, FKRP is involved in α-DG glycosylation, as shown by Brockington et al 70. While the 
regulation of α-DG glycosylation appears to be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of 
LGMDR9 71, other studies indicate, on the one hand, that several FKRP mutations do not affect α-DG 
glycosylation 72 and, on the other hand, that there is no correlation between the severity of LGMDR9 
and  α-DG  glycosylation  73.  Taken  together,  these  studies  suggest  that  the  detailed  molecular 
mechanisms underpinning muscular symptoms and pathological pathways in LGMDR9 are still to be 
elucidated. In our study, we used one hiPSC line provided by the LGMD2I Research Fund and 
generated three extra hiPSC lines with different mutations. After differentiation into skMt, our 
results  confirmed  that  the  absence  of  FKRP  does  not  lead  to  a  systematic  decrease  in  α-DG 
glycosylation in LGMDR9. Only one cell line (FKRP1 with the V300A/A321E mutation) was shown to 
affect this phenotype, in line with previous studies 72.   
 
Conclusions 
In the current study, we demonstrated that skMt derived from hiPSC can be used to model a large 
panel of LGMD. We showed that almost all genes and proteins involved in LGMD were expressed. We 
also demonstrated the biological relevance of this model derived from hiPSC through its ability to 
recapitulate the pathological phenotype identified for LGMDR9. Overall, this study opens up new 
perspectives on the use of this cellular model to study molecular mechanisms associated with LGMD, 
but also for the development of high-content phenotypic assays and associated drug screenings.

Materials and Methods 
Cell  lines.  Experiments  were  performed  with  human  immortalized  myoblasts  from  unaffected 
individuals or with hiPSC from control and LGMDR9-affected patients. The myoblast cell lines were 
established from human muscular biopsies and obtained from the MyoLine immortalization platform 
of  the  Institut de Myologie  (Paris, France),  with  the agreement of the  subjects through their 
signature on an informed consent form and anonymization before immortalization, in line with the 
EU GDPR regulation. The four cell lines used are the following: C25, AB678, AB1079, AB1167. The 
WT1 and WT2 hiPSC lines were reprogrammed from healthy IMR-90 lung fibroblasts obtained from 
the ATCC Cell Lines Biology Collection (Washington, USA) and from GM1869 provided by the Coriell 
Cell Repository (Camden, USA) 74,75. The WT3 iPSC line is a commercial cell line provided by Phenocell 
(Grasse, France). Wild type eGFP-tagged hiPSC lines, AICS-37 and AICS-48, were provided by the 
Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, USA): troponinI1 (TNNI1) and titin (TTN) were endogenously tagged 
with  mEGFP  at  the  C-terminus  site  using  CRISPR-Cas9  technology.  The  FKRP1  iPSC  line  was

reprogrammed  by  Phenocell  (Grasse,  France)  from  LGMDR9  fibroblasts  (heterozygous  FKRP 
V300A/A321E) provided by Genethon’s Cell Bank (Evry, France). FKRP2 and FKRP3 iPSC lines were 
also  reprogrammed  by  Phenocell  (Grasse,  France)  from  LGMDR9  fibroblasts  (heterozygous 
L276I/K291A and L276I/A45, respectively) provided by the Coriell Institute (Camden, USA). The FKRP4 
iPSC line (heterozygous L276I/VUS) was provided by the LGMD2I Research Fund. 
 
Cell culture and differentiation. Immortalized myoblasts were cultivated in a growth medium: 1 
volume of 199 medium (Invitrogen) for 4 volumes of DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 20% 
FCS (Sigma), 25 µg/ml fetuin (Life Technologies), 5 ng/ml hEGF (Life Technologies), 0.5 ng/ml bFGF 
(Life Technologies), 0.2 µg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma) and 5 µg/ml insulin (Sigma). Cells were seeded 
on 0.1% gelatin and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Differentiation was 
induced at confluence by replacing the growth medium with DMEM supplemented with 10 μg/ml 
insulin (Sigma) for 7 days. Control and LGMDR9 hiPSC lines were maintained and expanded using a 
single cell method on feeder-free coated dishes (Matrigel, Corning) with iPS-Brew XF medium (Macs, 
Milteny  Biotech).  hiPSC  were  differentiated  into  skMC  following  a  protocol  developed  by 
Geneabiocell ® (Caron et al., 2016). Briefly, hiPSC were seeded in collagen I-coated plates (Biocoat, 
DB Biosciences) and maintained for 10 days in skeletal muscle induction medium (SKM01, AMSBIO) 
with a passage at Day 7. Cells were then dissociated with 0.05% trypsin and seeded once again onto 
collagen I-coated plates for 7 days in skeletal myoblast medium (SKM02, AMSBIO) until freezing. 
skMb were thawed on collagen I-coated glass slides in skeletal myoblast medium and incubated at 
confluence with skeletal muscle differentiation medium (SKM03, AMSBIO) for 5 to 7 supplementary 
days. hiPSC, skMb and skMt were analyzed at Days 0, 17 and 24 of differentiation, respectively. 
 
Flow cytometry. A single-cell suspension of hiPSC was collected after chemical dissociation with 
accutase (Invitrogen), centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 2% FBS in cold PBS. Cells 
were stained with fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies for 30 min on ice and protected from light. 
Antibodies: APC-conjugated TRA1-80 (Millipore) and PE-conjugated SSEA4 (Millipore). Cells were 
washed in cold PBS before being sorted by a MACSquant analyzer (MiltenyiBiotec). Data were 
analyzed with FlowJo Software (Tree Star). 
 
Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-FISH) karyotype analysis. Cells were blocked in 
metaphase with colchicine (Eurobio) for 90 min, warmed with a hypotonic solution and fixed with a 
Carnoy fixative. An M-FISH 24Xcite probe (MetaSystems) and ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with 
DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for m-FISH staining. 70 metaphases were acquired with 
Metafer MetaSystems software coupled to an AxioImager Z2 (Zeiss) microscope equipped with a

camera  cool  cube  and  10X  and  63X  objectives.  Images  were  analyzed  with  Isis  software 
(MetaSystems). 
 
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells at Days 0, 17 or 24 of skMC differentiation were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. For two antibodies (FKTN and TCAP), cells were 
pre-fixed and then fixed in cold methanol for 5 min at room temperature. After 3 washes in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized, or not, with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min 
and blocked in PBS solution supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 1 hour at 
room temperature. Cells were stained for specific markers overnight at 4°C using the antibodies 
listed in Table S3. After 3 washes in PBS, staining was revealed by appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary 
antibodies (ThermoFisher Scientific Life Sciences; 1:1000) in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature 
and nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen; 1:2000). Cell imaging was carried out with 
a Zen Black software-associated LSM-800 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 20x or 63X objective. 
 
Time lapse imaging of skMt differentiation. Time-lapses of  skMt were recorded as  previously 
described, from Day 0 to Day 5 of differentiation. Imaging of endogenous GFP-tagged titin and 
troponin signaling was carried out with an Incucyte® S3 Live-Cell Analysis system (Sartorius) or a LSM-
800 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 20x objective, using Zen Black software. Differentiation 
efficiency was measured as the percentage of GFP-tagged cells at each time point using ImageJ 
software and normalized to the total number of skMt. An algorithm was used to determine the 
percentage of cells when at least 50% of the area of an identified nucleus was covered by GFP 
staining. Differentiation efficiency was calculated from 5 random fields comprising at least 300 cells. 
The results are expressed as mean values +/- S.E.M. *** p<0.005 (Student’s t-test). 
 
Quantitative PCR. Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Mini extraction kit (Qiagen) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A DNase I digestion was performed to degrade DNA in the 
sample. RNA levels and quality were checked using the NanoDrop technology. A total of 500 ng of 
RNA was used for reverse transcription using the SuperScript III reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). 
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was performed using a QuantStudio 12]K 
Flex real-time PCR system (Applied biosystem) and Luminaris Probe qPCR Master Mix (Thermo 
Scientific), following the manufacturers’ instructions. Gene expression analysis was performed using 
the  TaqMan  gene  expression  Master  Mix  (Roche),  following  the  manufacturer’s  protocol. 
Quantification  of  gene  expression  was  based  on  the  DeltaCt  method  and  normalized  to  18S 
expression (Assay HS_099999). The primers and probe sequences that were designed are listed in 
Table S2. The sequences of the remaining genes are commercially available (Applied biosystem):

(Hs00189308). 
 
Western immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysate of control and LGMDR9-skMt were collected after seven 
days  of  differentiation.  Proteins  were  extracted  with  RIPA  lysis  buffer  (Thermo  Scientific) 
supplemented with 1X Protease Inhibitor-Complete ULTRA tablets mini (Roche) and 1X benzonase 
nuclease HC (Millipore) for 1]h at 4]°C. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA 
Protein  Assay  Kit  (ThermoScientific)  and  the  absorbance  at  562  nm  was  evaluated  using  a 
CLARIOstar® microplate reader (BMG Labtech). For α-DG protein detection, a total of 130]μg of 
protein  was  loaded  and  run  on  Mini-PROTEAN  4-12%  bis-tris  protein  gels  (BioRad)  and  then 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfert system (Biorad), following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were then blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor) 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking 
buffer was carried out at 4°C from 2 hours to overnight for the mouse anti-α-DG-IIH6 1:50 (DSHB), 
the mouse anti-α-DG-IIH6 1:1000 (Merck Millipore) and the mouse anti-β-DG 1:200 (DSHB). Washing 
was carried out 3 times for 10 minutes at room temperature with TBS + 0.1% Tween20 and the 
membranes were incubated with a donkey anti-mouse antibody IRDye-800CW 1:5000 (Li-Cor) in 
blocking buffer. Washing was carried out and proteins were detected by fluorescence (Odyssey, Li-
Cor), following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means ±]SD unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis 
was performed using the Student’s t test. P values ≤ 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.005 (***) were 
considered significant.
