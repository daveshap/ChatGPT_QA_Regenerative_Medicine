Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive inherited neurological disease characterized by the 
degeneration of basal ganglia and the accumulation of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates in 
specific brain areas. Currently, there is no treatment for halting the progression of HD. Cerebral 
dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a novel endoplasmic reticulum located protein with 
neurotrophic factor properties that protects and restores dopamine neurons in rodent and non‑
human primate models of Parkinson’s disease. Our recent study showed that CDNF improves motor 
coordination and protects NeuN positive cells in a Quinolinic acid toxin rat model of HD. Here we have 
investigated the effect of chronic intrastriatal CDNF administration on behavior and mHtt aggregates 
in the N171‑82Q mouse model of HD. Data showed that CDNF did not significantly decrease the 
number of mHtt aggregates in most brain regions studied. Notably, CDNF significantly delayed 
the onset of symptoms and improved motor coordination in N171‑82Q mice. Furthermore, CDNF 
increased BDNF mRNA level in hippocampus in vivo in the N171‑82Q model and BDNF protein level 
in cultured striatal neurons. Collectively our results indicate that CDNF might be a potential drug 
candidate for the treatment of HD.
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease in which striatal and cortical neurons 
d egenerate1,2. The cause of HD is the expression of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) with polyQ repeat expansion 
present in the N-terminal part of the  protein3. Mouse models expressing N-terminal mHtt show the formation 
of neuronal intranuclear inclusions within the striatum and  cortex4,5 corresponding to the pathology observed 
in HD  patients6,7, including motor deficits and cognitive impairments.
In this study, we used the genetic N171-82Q mouse model of HD, which has a longer lifespan than the R6/2 
transgenic model but a similar  phenotype8–10. In this model, cDNA encoding a 171-amino acid N-terminal 
fragment of Htt containing 82 glutamine repeats is expressed under the mouse prion protein p romoter11, which 
drives the expression primarily in  neurons12. N171-82Q mice develop behavioral changes including clasping 
of hindlimbs, tremor and weight loss from 8 to 12 weeks of age and with an endpoint at 16–22  weeks13–15. 
N171-82Q mice have been used in preclinical trials for screening therapeutic drug candidates as they show fast 
symptom progression and demonstrates the wide expression of mHtt inclusions in the b rain9. Especially, there 
are intranuclear and cytoplasmic perinuclear mHtt inclusions in the brains of N171-82Q  mice12. The function 
of mHtt inclusions is still largely unclear, but data suggest that N-terminal mHtt is present in a larger complex 
with other proteins in the  brain16.
Currently, there is no effective treatment to stop neurodegeneration in the affected brain areas of HD patients. 
Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are secretory proteins that are involved in the survival, development, differentia-
tion and functional recovery of neurons. There are decreased levels of NTFs in the brains of patients with neu-
rodegenerative diseases including Parkinson´s disease (PD), Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and H  D17–19, and these

factors have therefore also been tested in preclinical and clinical trials of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
AD, PD and  HD20–24.
Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a conserved secreted protein that is expressed in neuronal 
and non-neuronal  tissue25–28. CDNF is a member of the mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor 
(MANF)-CDNF family, which differs from classical NTFs in terms of structure, biological functions and diffusion 
c apacity29. CDNF contains two structural domains: the N-terminal domain, which most likely binds with lipids, 
and the C-terminal domain, which contains the KTEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention  signal30,31. CDNF 
is located and secreted in the lumen of the  ER21,32. Previous data on the effects of CDNF on ER stress markers 
support the hypothesis of direct regulation of UPR pathways by C  DNF22,33. Moreover, recent data showed that 
CDNF interacts with the main ER chaperone Bip (as known as GRP78)34, is upregulated and secreted in response 
to experimental ER stress, and protects cells from ER stress-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo24,35.
The diffusion of CDNF in brain is more prolonged and distributed widely than that of other NTFs, and the 
half-life is approximately 5.5  h23,36,37. Previous studies have demonstrated that CDNF exerts neuroprotective and 
neurorestorative effects in rodent and non-human primate models of P D27,37–39. Notably, in the phase I/II clinical 
trials on PD patients, CDNF demonstrated safety and showed increased dopamine transporter availability in the 
putamen of some patients in positron emission computer tomography (DAT PET)  analyses21.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that a single intrastriatal injection of CDNF has a positive effect in 
the quinolinic acid (QA)-toxin model of  HD23. CDNF improved motor behavior and increased the NeuN- and 
doublecortin-immunopositive cell populations in vivo and protected striatal neurons after QA toxin-induced 
cell death in vitro. These findings highlighted  the importance of CDNF as a potential drug candidate also in HD. 
However, studying the effect of CDNF further in vivo using genetic models of HD is crucial for its possible future 
application in clinical trials.
In the present study, we infused CDNF for 4 weeks unilaterally into the striatum of the N171-82Q mice 
using an Alzet minipump to study the effect of CDNF on motor coordination. We were additionally interested 
in studying the effect of CDNF on mHtt aggregates in these mice using a deep learning neural network method 
developed for this purpose.
Our results demonstrate that CDNF alleviated motor dysfunction in N171-82Q mice by decreasing the per-
centage of animals with clasped hindlimbs. Additionally, CDNF improved motor coordination in N171-82Q 
females as measured by rotarod and the beam walking tests. Using a deep learning method, we concluded that 
CDNF has a tendency for reducing the EM48 immunoreactivity and the number of intranuclear aggregates in the 
striatum of female mice after CDNF treatment. CDNF further increased the mRNA level of BDNF in the brains 
of N171-82Q mice, as well as BDNF protein levels in neuronal cultures. The results also suggest that CDNF can 
affect ER stress at the high expression injection site, with a tendency to reduce ER stress markers in the striatum 
following CDNF administration. The results support that CDNF significantly improves behavior in the N171-
82Q mouse model of HD that may be beneficial for future therapies and as such warrants further investigations.
Materials and methods
Animals.  Adult female and male C57BL/6JRccHsd × B6C3-Tg (HD82Gln)81Gschi/J mice (9 weeks) were 
used for the chronic CDNF infusion experiment. The wild-type (WT) naïve animals (C57BL/6JRccHsd) were 
used as a control group. Animal experiments were approved by the Finnish National Board of Animal Experi-
ments and were carried out according to the European Community guidelines for the use of experimental ani-
mals with the license numbers, ESAVI/8897/04.10.07/2017 and ESAVI/27113/2020. Reporting in the manu-
script follows the recommendations in the ARRIVE guidelines.
Chronic CDNF delivery.  Mice were anaesthetised under isoflurane anaesthesia (3.5% during induction and 
2.5–3% during maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A tip of an infusion cannula was implanted 
into the right striatum (A/P + 0.86; M/L − 1.8; D/V − 3.0), connected via a plastic catheter tube to an Alzet min-
ipump (model 1004, Agnthos, Sweden). The Alzet minipump was implanted subcutaneously into the mid scapu-
lar area. The minipumps released CDNF protein (rhCDNF, Batch 00400, 9.6 µg/µl, Biovian, Turku, Finland) 
(3 µg/24 h) (n = 26 for the male group, n = 14 for the female group) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n = 27 
for the male group, n = 19 for the female group) for four weeks (Fig. 1). The cannula was fixed to the skull with 
Superglue Loctite 454 (Agnthos, Sweden). In the experiment, the mice were balanced into groups based on their 
rotarod motor performance before drug treatment. At 15 weeks of age of mice, the minipumps were removed, 
male mice were sacrificed after minipump removal, whereas females were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age (Fig. 1). 
This was based on the survival difference between genders (Suppl. Fig. 1).
CDNF diffusion after chronic intrastriatal delivery.  In the diffusion experiment (Fig. 2), we used 
the tissue from mice N171-82Q and WT naïve mice, which received a chronic infusion of rhCDNF protein 
(3 µg/24 h) (human recombinant CDNF, Batch 00400, 9.6 µg/µl, Biovian, Turku, Finland) based on the protocol 
of chronic CDNF delivery, which was mentioned above. N171-82Q males (n = 2) were sacrificed right after the 
minipump stopped working (at 15 weeks age), whereas N171-82Q females (n = 4) were sacrificed one week later 
(at 16 weeks age). The analysis of diffusion was performed on tissue from a subset of animals from the CDNF 
infusion experiment. We used healthy naïve mice (n = 3) as a control for visual illustration of the CDNF diffu-
sion.
Behavioral experiments.  Animal adaptation was performed when mice were 9 weeks of age; one week 
before baseline behavioral testing was done (10 weeks). Behavioral testing during the CDNF (or PBS) infusion 
period was performed weekly from 11 to 15 weeks of age for males or until 16 weeks of age for females. Untreated

(no minipump installation) N171-82Q mice (n = 8 (males group) and n = 6 (females group) for Rotarod test; 
n = 4 (males group) and n = 5 (females group) for balance beam test) and wild-type mice (n = 13 (males group) 
and n = 6 (females group) for Rotarod test) were also used in behavioral tests as controls. The rotarod test system 
was used for measuring locomotion activity (Ugo Basile, Italy). The rotation speed was gradually increased from 
4 to 40 rpm (revolutions per minute) over a maximum of 240 s. The average falling time was measured across 
trials, which were conducted twice per week. Moreover, balance motor coordination was analyzed by the balance 
beam walking test. Animals were placed on the round stick and were allowed to walk on it for a maximum of 
three minutes once per week. The travel distance and falling time were recorded. Any animals in poor condition 
or near the endpoint and who could not perform the behavioral tests were given zero scores. The digigait test 
(Ventral Plane Imaging (VPI) Technology, USA) was used as an additional motor test to check more specific 
stride/swing motor parameters. The speed of the treadmill (20 cm/s) was optimally chosen for all animals. Only 
animals who were able to perform the test over three-second intervals were used in the analysis. The hind limb 
clasping score was measured based on a previous  study40.
Immunostaining.  After the behavioral experiments, mice were anaesthetized and perfused with PBS, fol-
lowed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Postfixed whole brains were stored in either 4% PFA or 4% PFA 
with further storage in 30% sucrose solution depending on the further procedure. The brains which were stored 
in 4% PFA were embedded in paraffin, further deparaffinized and cut into 10-µm-thick sections for immunohis-
tochemical analysis; brains that were stored in sucrose solution were cut into 30 µm-thick free-floating sections 
and analyzed in the diffusion experiment.
CDNF immunohistochemistry.  For these experiments, we used free-floating and paraffin-fixed sections for 
immunostaining and the ABC method. The free-floating sections (30 µm) were rinsed with PBS with follow-
ing blocking in the mixture of 1% BSA, 0,2% Triton-×-100 in PBS for 1 h. Thereafter, sections were incubated 
in mouse anti-human CDNF antibody (mouse-hCDNF-6G5, stock solution 0.4 mg/ml, Icosagen, #302-100, 
1:2000) overnight at 4 °C. The next day sections were incubated in anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibody 
solution (1:400, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, followed by incubation in avidin-biotin-horse-
radish peroxidase complex (ABC) (Vestastain ABC kit, Vector) complex for 30 min. Staining was achieved with 
a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (SK-4100, Vector DAB substrate kit).
Paraffin sections (10 µm) were deparaffinized by incubation of slides with sections in xylene for 4 × 5 min then 
100% ethanol for 3 × 3 min, 95% ethanol for 3 min, 70% ethanol for 3 min, 50% ethanol for 3 min and deionized 
water ( dHO) for 3 min. Antigen retrieval was done by heating in 10 mM citrate buffer for 10 min and sections 
2
were rinsed using 1xPBS, and blocked with 1% BSA, 0.2% Triton-×-100 in PBS for 1 h and incubated overnight 
at 4 °C with mouse anti-CDNF antibody (mouse monoclonal, human CDNF, clone 6G5, Icosagen, 1:1000). Sec-
tions were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:400; Vector Laboratories, 
Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, and then for 30 min with ABC (Vestastain ABC kit, Vector) complex. Staining was 
achieved with DAB solution (SK-4100, Vector DAB substrate kit). After DAB staining slides with sections were 
incubated in 50% ethanol for 3 min, 70% ethanol for 3 min, 94% ethanol for 3 min, 100% ethanol for 2 × 2 min 
and in xylene 2 × 3 min for dehydration.
NeuN‑, TH‑, DARPP32‑ and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry.  Immunostaining was performed on par-
affinized brain sections using the ABC method. Sections were deparaffinized and incubated with 10 mM cit-
rate buffer for 10 min as above, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% normal goat serum in TBS-T 
(1×TBS, 0.1% Tween-20). Following washing primary antibody was added overnight at 4 °C. These included 
NeuN antibody (mouse, 1:500 Chemicon, #MAB377), DARPP-32 (1:4000, rabbit, Abcam #ab40801), parvalbu-
min (mouse, 1:1000, Millipore #MAB1752), TH (mouse, 1:2000, Chemicon #MAB318). Sections were rinsed in 
TBS-T (1xTBS, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 or 1:400 for DARPP-
32; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation for 30 min with 
avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase (ABC) complex. Staining was achieved with DAB solution (SK-4100, Vec-
tor DAB substrate kit). Further dehydration of slides was conducted. Slides with sections were placed into Mil-
liQ followed by dipping in 50% ethanol for 3 min, 70% ethanol for 3 min, 94% ethanol for 3 min, 100% ethanol 
for 2 × 2 min and after in xylene 2 × 3 min). After dehydration coverslips with Depex mounting medium were 
placed on the glasses with sections. All sections were scanned with a Pannoramic 250 digital slide scanner 
(3DHISTECH, Hungary). Three to six striatal brain sections were used to measure immunoreactivity, which was 
quantitated relative to the control group. ImagePro was used to quantitate NeuN- and Parv-positive cells and all 
measurements were performed by personnel blinded to the treatment. ImageJ was used to analyze DARPP32- 
and TH- optical density, where corpus callosum area was used as background.
EM48 immunohistochemistry.  We used EM48 antibody to detect mHtt aggregates, which targets the N-termi-
nal region of human Htt (amino acids 1-212). The analysis was performed on the paraffinized brain Sections 
(10 µm) with the ABC method. After deparaffinisation, antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase inactiva-
tion, sections were incubated in TBS-T (1×TBS, 0.1% Tween20). Nonspecific binding was blocked by BSA (4% 
BSA, 0.3% triton-×-100, PBS). The sections were incubated with mouse EM48 (1:100, Millipore #MAB5374) for 
48 h at 4 °C. After several washes in TBS-T (1×TBS, 0.1% Tween-20), the sections were incubated with goat anti-
mouse secondary antibodies (1:200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by incubation for 30 min 
with ABC complex. Staining was developed with the DAB method with DAB substrate kit (SK-4100, Vector), 
then sections were dehydrated and mounted using cover slips. All sections were scanned with a Pannoramic 250 
digital slide scanner (3DHISTECH, Hungary). Three to six striatal brain sections were used to measure immu-

noreactivity, which was quantitated relative to the control group (N171-82Q-PBS). Healthy animals (WT) did 
not have mHtt aggregates and were not used in the analysis. Aiforia Create version 5.0 (Aiforia Technologies Oy) 
was used to analyse EM48-immunoreactivity and inclusions.
Deep learning neural network Aiforia analysis of mutant huntingtin aggregates.  Neuronal 
cells and respective aggregates, in addition to tissue detection, were detected using artificial intelligence solu-
tions by Aiforia Technologies Oy (Helsinki, Finland). This was achieved by implementing Aimodel/algorithm 
generated using Aiforia Create (Aiforia Technologies Oy; www. aifor ia. com) version 5.0. Tissue regions were 
detected using semantic segmentation with complex mode and were a parent layer to the neuronal cell layer. 
EM48-immunoreactive mHtt aggregates were detected using object detectors (10 µm in diameter), and bounda-
ries of the same were detected using the instance segmentation feature within Aiforia Create. EM48-antibodies 
labelled intranuclear inclusions were also detected using object detectors (5 µm in diameter) as a child layer 
to the cell body layer, which was set as the parent layer under which all aggregates were predicted. Boundaries 
of aggregates were also detected using instance segmentation. All the objects and instances for both neuronal 
cells (parent layer) and intranuclear aggregates (child layer) were set to very complex mode. Collectively the 
algorithm was generated with 2881 iterations, the algorithm was released, and data was analyzed in Aiforia Hub 
(Aiforia Technologies Oy). An example of the Aiforia detection system is shown in Fig. 6.
Quantitative analysis of EM48 immunohistochemistry.  Data was exported from Aiforia Hub, and 
further data processing was done by applying the following thresholds: the EM48-immunolabelled mHtt aggre-
gates were in size range from 28 to 120 µm2, for intranuclear inclusions (between 1.5 and 8 µm2). Intranuclear 
inclusions were divided into groups based on area size and all inclusions smaller than 1.5 µm2 were counted as 
microaggregates and were not included in the final calculation of intranuclear inclusions. Quantitative data for 
analysis was performed as average across the area from several sections. The final analysis is performed as aver-
age between animals per each group and showed as density of EM48-positive cells and number of intranuclear 
inclusions separately in each region of interest.
RT‑qPCR.  Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to ana-
lyze the ER stress markers and BDNF levels after chronic intrastriatal administration of CDNF in N171-82Q 
mice. Brain samples were placed into the mouse brain matrix for further sectioning, which helped to collect 
small brain regions by steel punch. Brain samples from the striatum and hippocampus were collected for further 
analysis. Total RNA was isolated from mouse brain tissue using TriReagent (Sigma Aldrich, MI, USA), and 
cDNA was made using Oligo(dT)18 primers with 1 µg, 500 ng or 200 ng RNA and Maxima H Minus Reverse 
Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). cDNA was further diluted to 5 ng/µl, and 1 µl was used as 
a template in 10 ul total reaction for qPCR using the Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche, Switzer-
land) reaction kit. ER stress marker mRNAs (GRP78, ATF4, ATF6, CHOP and XBP1S) or BDNF mRNA and 5.8S 
reference gene expression were detected with Light Cycler® 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Switzerland). 
The relative fold gene expression was calculated using the ∆∆Ct method. Results were expressed as a combina-
tion of female and male tissue, as there was no difference between genders. The list of primers is presented in 
Supplementary Fig. 2.
Cell cultures and immunoblotting.  Striatal cell lines derived from mice expressing different Htt geno-
types and immortalized with a temperature sensitive large T antigen were used as previously d escribed41. Con-
trol Htt cells expressed 7 polyglutamine (7Q) repeats while mHtt cells expressed 109 polyglutamine (109Q) 
repeats. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 mM L-glutamine (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) and 100 mM penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 33 °C in 5% C  O. For the 
2
experiments, the cells were incubated further for two days at 37 °C to induce neuronal differentiation. 100 ng/ml 
CDNF was then added for 24 h to half of the cultures, while the other half received vehicle only. Subsequently 
the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-×-100, 0.5% 
sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (COEDTAF-
RO, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PHOSS-RO, Roche). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,200×g for 
15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were measured using Pierce 
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Equal amounts of protein (40 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes as previously  described42,43. The membranes were washed with TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM 
NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), blocked for 1 h in 5% skimmed milk diluted in TBS-T, and incubated with primary 
antibodies against BDNF (1:500, Icosagen, #329-100) or GAPDH (1:10,000, Millipore, #MAB374) overnight at 
4 °C with gentle agitation. Following washes with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish per-
oxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, UK) for 1 h at room 
temperature with gentle agitation. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Pierce ECL Plus 
Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged on FLA-9000 Starion scanner (Fujifilm Life 
Sciences, MA, USA). The immunoblots were quantified with ImageJ quantification software (NIH, MD, USA).
Statistical analyses.  The results were analyzed with repeated‐measures ANOVA and mixed-effects 
ANOVA or unpaired/paired t‐test for behavioral tests. One-way ANOVA was used for the analysis of three and 
more groups. The Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank and the Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to analyze the 
percentage of animals with clasped hindlimbs. The survival test was analyzed with the log-rank Mantel-Cox test.

Immunological results were analyzed by ANOVA and Student’s t-test, and RT-qPCR data by unpaired t-tests. 
Results are shown as means ± SEMs and considered significant at a value of p ≤ 0.05. All statistical tests and 
graphs were performed in GraphPad Prism software version 7.02. (GraphPad, CA, USA, www. graph pad. com).
Results
Diffusion of CDNF in brain tissue of N171‑82Q mice.  The diffusion of CDNF in brain tissue after 
chronic intrastriatal infusion was characterized in N171-82Q mice (Fig. 2), and in WT mice not receiving CDNF 
were used as controls (Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemical CDNF staining illustrates the distribution of CDNF 
across the brain in the N171-82Q mouse model. As shown in Fig. 2B,C the diffusion of CDNF had a gender 
diversity with female having a more extensive diffusion pattern. N171-82Q male mice showed very small diffu-
sion area, which was visible only near the injection site. CDNF diffusion was visible across the brain in N171-
82Q females, from the site of injection rostrocaudally. In these experiments, the endpoints of analyses in the two 
genders were different based on the progression of symptoms. Thus, the N171-82Q males were sacrificed one 
week earlier than females at 15 weeks of age, whereas the females were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age, which may 
account for this difference observed (Fig. 1).
CDNF postpones the onset of symptoms and improves motor coordination in the N171‑82Q 
transgenic mouse model.  We next examined the effects of chronic CDNF infusion on behavior of N171-
82Q mice. There was a significant weight loss between WT and untreated N171-82Q mice, CDNF- and PBS-
treated male and female groups; however, no difference between CDNF- and PBS-treatment groups was found 
(Suppl. Fig. 3). We conducted the rotarod test twice per week to assess motor deficits, and the average between 
two-time points was used in the analysis. The results of the rotarod performance demonstrated a significant 
effect only in motor presentation and cumulative latency to fall between WT animals and N171-82Q male 
groups, but there was no effect between treatment groups (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test p < 0.0001) 
(Fig. 3A). A significant drug treatment effect was observed between N171-82Q females in the PBS- and CDNF-
treated groups in motor performance (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, treatment × time interaction effect 
 f  = 1.091, p = 0.3572; time effect  f  = 3.411, p = 0.0068; treatment effect  f  = 4.390, p = 0.0091) (Fig. 3B).

CDNF-treated female mice showed significantly higher cumulative latency to fall compared to untreated and 
PBS-treated transgenic females (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test p < 0.0001, p < 0.005) (Fig. 3B). Moreo-
ver, we examined balance performance as an additional motor assessment test. The balance beam test showed no 
difference in travel distance and falling time between the transgenic male groups (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, a sig-
nificant improvement in balance, analyzed by travel distance in the balance beam test, was noted in the CDNF-
treated female group during the first week after minipump installation (mixed-effect ANOVA test, Sidak’s post 
hoc test p < 0.01, p < 0.005) (Fig. 3C).
The clasping of hindlimbs was tested as indicated (Fig. 4A). Clasping usually increases during the develop-
ment of pathology in HD mouse  models40. The clasping score was significantly decreased (Kruskal–Wallis’s 
test, Dunn’s post hoc test p < 0.005, p < 0.05) in the CDNF-treated males compared with PBS group (Fig. 4B), 
while females did not show significant differences in clasping score progression (Fig. 4C). We further observed 
the number of animals with totally clasped hindlimbs, which revealed that the percentage of males with totally 
clasped hindlimbs in the CDNF-treated male group was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle group 
(paired t-test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). Additionally, CDNF-treated females showed a positive tendency to a decrease 
in the number of clasping animals (paired t-test, p = 0.05) (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, the results with the behavioral tests reveal that CDNF has a positive effect on motor coordina-
tion in the N171-82Q mice compared with corresponding PBS treated mice.
The effect of CDNF on nerve cell immunoreactivity and brain weight in N171‑82Q mice.  To 
study the effects of CDNF in more detail we performed immunohistochemistry using brain sections from mice. 
We observed no differences in NeuN-, Parv- and DARPP-32- immunoreactivity after CDNF administration in 
the N171-82Q mice at 11 weeks (Suppl. Fig. 4). Moreover, the TH optical density in the striatal area of N171-
82Q mice was not altered by CDNF (Suppl. Fig. 4). The endpoint for this experiment was 15 weeks for males and 
16 weeks for females that may have been too early to observe any significant changes in immunostainings. On 
the other hand, analyzing the size of the brain demonstrated a smaller brain weight of N171-82Q mice compared 
with WT (Fig. 5). The average difference in the brain weight between WT and N171-82Q CDNF-treated male 
animals was slightly smaller than the difference between WT animals and N171-82Q PBS-treated male group 
(Fig. 5). On the other hand, N171-82Q females had a similar reduction in brain weight in both CDNF- and 
PBS-treatment groups compared with WT (Fig. 5). We further noticed that the volume of the striatum, cortex 
and piriform cortex showed no significant difference between PBS- and CDNF-treated groups (Suppl. Fig. 5).
Diversity of EM48‑immunoreactive mHtt aggregates in control and N171‑82Q mice.  To eval-
uate the effect of CDNF treatment on mHtt aggregation, we first analyzed the distribution of the latter using a 
deep neural network-based Aiforia platform (see Fig. 6A,B) in untreated N171-82Q mice. Algorithm was gener-
ated with 2881 iterations and released when false-negative and false-positive error rates were 0.05 and below.
For this, EM48-positive cells were analyzed in three brain areas: striatum (Fig. 6C), cortex (Fig. 6D) and the 
piriform cortex (Fig. 6E). We observed two types of aggregates: neuropil and nuclear inclusions, but the neuro-
pil aggregates were challenging to calculate. Using the AI-algorithm we could detect EM48-positive cells (red 
color cells in Fig. 6C–E) and intranuclear inclusions (blue color in Fig. 6C–E). No EM48-positive aggregates 
were detected in wild-type control, and these animals were omitted from the analysis (data not shown). For our

We observed that N171-82Q mice had an age-dependent appearance of EM48-positive staining in the stria-

Effect of CDNF on mutant huntingtin aggregates in N171‑82Q mice.  To analyze the effects of 
CDNF on EM48 staining and intranuclear aggregates in N171-82Q mice we studied mainly the striatum, neo-
cortex and piriform cortex, albeit there were also aggregates present in the hippocampus (data not shown). 
Whereas CDNF-treatment showed a tendency to reduce the number of EM48-positive staining in the striatal 
area of N171-82Q females (Fig. 8A) this was not the case for N171-82Q males. Moreover, CDNF did not signifi-
cantly reduce the number of mHtt inclusions in the striatum of N171-82Q females, neither was the size of mHtt 
inclusions different between groups (Fig. 8A). This was also the case when analyzing aggregates in the neocortex 
of female and male N171-82Q mice (Fig. 8B). There was, however, a slight decrease in mHtt intranuclear inclu-
sions after CDNF treatment in the piriform cortex of N171-82Q males (Fig. 8C), but this difference was not 
statistically significant. In addition, we observed a gender difference in the N171-82Q mice with respect to the 
amount of intranuclear inclusions in the striatum and the piriform cortex, with males having almost twice less 
inclusions compared with females (Fig. 8A,C). From the data obtained using the deep-learning approach it was 
further seen that CDNF did not affect the size of EM48-positive cells.

Collectively, our results revealed that chronic striatal CDNF administration did not significantly reduce the 
amount of mHtt inclusions in the striatum of N171-82Q female mice under the present conditions. On the other 
hand, in the piriform cortex of CDNF-treated N171-82Q male mice, there was a decrease in the number of intra-
nuclear mHtt inclusions compared with controls. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The 
obvious lack of an overall effect of CDNF on mHtt aggregates in other brain regions could be due to the relative 
concentration of CDNF present at the different locations and times in brain after infusion. This is an important 
issue warranting further investigations.
CDNF increases BDNF mRNA levels in vivo in N171‑82Q mice.  While studying gene expression 
levels in the N171-82Q mice, we observed that the BDNF mRNA levels were significantly decreased (unpaired 
t-test, p < 0.005) in the hippocampus of these mice compared with WT animals (Fig. 9A). We therefore examined 
whether the chronic CDNF infusion may also affect the BDNF mRNA levels. BDNF mRNA levels were signifi-
cantly higher in the hippocampus of N171-82Q CDNF-treated mice (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05) when compared 
with the PBS-treated group, suggesting that CDNF may partially rescue the loss of BDNF in N171-82Q mice 
(Fig. 9B). Interestingly, in these experiments we noted no decrease in BDNF mRNA level in the striatum and 
cortex of untreated N171-82Q mice (Fig. 9).
Effects of CDNF on BDNF in cultured striatal neurons.  To study whether CDNF indeed can affect 
BDNF levels in neurons, we studied cultured striatal neurons expressing mutant Htt with 109Q repeats. Cells 
incubated in vitro were stimulated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml CDNF followed by immunoblotting as described in 
Methods. Results showed that CDNF increased the level of mature BDNF (14 kDa) in these cells compared with

cells treated with vehicle only (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05; Fig. 10). Interestingly, there was no effect of CDNF on 
BDNF levels in striatal neurons expressing 7Q repeats containing Htt (data not shown). Together these results 
show that CDNF can increase BDNF in mHtt expressing striatal neurons in culture, which may contribute to its 
beneficial effects in the  neurons23.
CDNF effects on ER stress markers in the striatum of N171‑82Q mice.  Next we analyzed whether 
CDNF influences the mRNA levels of GRP78 (alias BIP), ATF4, ATF6, CHOP and XBP1S in the striatum of 
healthy controls and N171-82Q mice. Data showed that there was an increase in the expression of ER stress 
markers in the N171-82Q mice regardless of their gender compared with WT animals at endpoint based on 
their wellbeing, however, the changes in ER stress markers were not significantly different in N171-82Q mice as 
compared with WT mice (Fig. 11A). CDNF treatment reduced the level of all five ER stress markers on average 
compared to PBS, however this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 11B). However, there was a ten-
dency for reduced CHOP expression in the N171-82Q striatum after CDNF infusion (unpaired t-test, p = 0.08) 
(Fig. 11B). A similar trend was also seen for GRP78, ATF4, ATF6 and XBP1s expression after CDNF-treatment, 
although the data did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 11B). These findings may be related to the relatively 
low number of animals used in these experiments.

Discussion
As a background for the present study, we recently reported a positive effect of intrastriatal CDNF injection in 
the QA toxin rat model of HD. We found that CDNF is neuroprotective against QA toxicity in vitro and in vivo, 
and CDNF may also promote neurogenesis in vivo23. Previously, CDNF has been shown neuroprotective effects 
in different neuropathological conditions, such as in  PD27,37,38,44, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS)24.
Regarding the amount of protein used in in vivo experiments, several aspects were considered. In the 6-OHDA 
rat model of PD, chronic CDNF infusion (3 µg/day; 3 continuous days) improved motor imbalance and protected 
DA  neurons37. In the TDP-43 trangenic rat model of ALS, chronic 4-week CDNF intracerebroventricular infusion 
(6 µg/24 h) had a positive effect on motor coordination and protected motoneurons in spinal  cord24. Importantly, 
Garea-Rodriguez et al.39 revealed a significant increase of dopamine transporter binding activity in lesioned 
animals treated with CDNF as compared to vehicle-treated lesioned a nimals39. The outcome from clinical trials 
of PD patients conducted by Herantis Pharma showed pronounced DAT PET response in PD patients receiving 
a mid-dose CDNF compared to the high-dose  group47.
Based on the above findings and previous application of the same dose (3 µg/day; 1-month infusion) in the 
mouse model of ALS (De Lorenzo, doctoral thesis ISSN 2342-317X), we chose here to use a dose of 3 µg per day 
of recombinant human CDNF (rhCDNF) for our experiments. For this, we employed the N171-82Q transgenic 
mouse HD model that shows development of motor deficits, brain atrophy, and accumulation of mHtt aggregates, 
which comprise the significant signs of HD  pathology5. Important to note that the N171-82Q mouse model has 
wide phenotypical variability, thus it is necessary to include enough animals for the preclinical  studies9. Previous 
studies have also shown that the phenotypes of N171-82Q females and males can  differ48–50. In support of this, 
our present findings revealed a gender difference in motor coordination in the N171-82Q mice. Likewise, we 
found that the survival of N171-82Q male mice was shorter compared with N171-82Q females. This was also 
taken into account in the choice of endpoints used for studies of male and female N171-82Q mice.
We detected a significant difference between the effects of CDNF on the motor coordination and balance 
of N171-82Q mice compared with controls. Interestingly, CDNF treatment increased muscle strength in the 
rotarod test in N171-82Q females but not in males. Evaluation of balance coordination further showed that 
CDNF-treated N171-82Q females displayed longer travel distances than the vehicle group, but no difference 
was found for male mice. Likewise, CDNF did not affect the weight loss and stride length of both N171-82Q 
mice genders (Suppl. Fig. 3).
Most importantly, we observed a beneficial effect of CDNF on the clasping of hindlimbs in both genders, with 
N171-82Q males revealing a significantly lower clasping score after CDNF treatment. Notably, N171-82Q females 
showed a decrease in the number of animals with clasped hindlimbs even after the minipump’s removal, which 
indicates the prolongation of the positive effect of CDNF in the brain tissue. These results could be explained 
by the wider and longer diffusion of CDNF in the brain tissue of N171-82Q female mice (Fig. 2). The reason of 
the large difference in CDNF diffusion between both sexes can be explained by difference in the degradation of 
CDNF, however fundamental basis of it is unclear and warrants further investigations.
Furthermore, we observed that brain weight was higher on average in the CDNF-treated N171-82Q males 
in comparison with PBS-treated or untreated N171-82Q males (Fig. 5). However, immunostaining of the brain 
sections revealed no difference in NeuN- or in Parv- and DARPP-32 immunoreactivity between the groups. It 
is possible that the endpoint chosen for these experiments was too early to detect any significant neuronal loss, 
therefore additional studies using later endpoints are warranted.
The accumulation of mHtt aggregates is usually considered as a hallmark for the progression of HD. The 
prevention of mHtt aggregation can also be a potential therapeutic target for slowing symptoms or inducing 
recovery during the disease. However, the precise physiological role of mHtt aggregates is still under debate and 
could change during the course of the  disease51. As shown for other neurodegenerative diseases, different types 
and stages of protein aggregates can be present in vulnerable cells underlying the disease process. Previously, it

was suggested that only the monomeric or oligomeric stage of mHtt and not large visible aggregates could cause 
ER stress linked to the  disease52. In line with this, it was reported that the oligomeric, non-aggregated form of 
mHtt is the most toxic  species53, and that the formation of mHtt aggregates might be a coping mechanism by 
neurons to reduce mHtt toxicity.
Previous studies have shown that the expression of mutant N-terminal fragments of mHtt protein in neu-
ronal cells induces the formation of aggregates with increased cell  toxicity54. It was shown that the localization 
of EM48 aggregates show gradual increase of nuclear aggregates formation from early to the late stages of HD 
progression in the cortex in postmortem tissue and opposite tendency in the striatum  area55. The formation of 
EM48-positive aggregates was found in the striatum and cortex of N171-82Q mice with no presentation in white 
 matter12, while the detailed detection and progression of EM48 aggregates in these areas in N171-82Q have not 
been highlighted. In the present study, we examined the development of EM48-positive aggregates in vivo in 
the N171-82Q mouse model of HD using a novel approach based on a deep learning method. We observed a 
gradual age-dependent increase in the number and size of EM48-positive cells and intranuclear inclusions in 
the striatum, neocortex and piriform cortex in N171-82Q mice. These findings indicate a correlation between 
the deterioration of motor behavior observed in these mice and the appearance of the mHtt aggregates. In sup-
port of this, there is an increase in EM48-positive inclusions found in old compared with young mice in another 
mouse model of HD, the R6/1 mice at the time of motor deficits  appearing56.
Employing an unbiased AI-based method for aggregation detection, we then investigated whether CDNF 
treatment in vivo would influence mHtt aggregation. We hypothesised that CDNF could possibly be involved in 
the degradation or the prevention of mHtt aggregates formed by activating the proteasome or autophagy in neu-
rons. Data obtained showed that there was a trend towards a decrease in the density of EM48-immunoreactivity 
and the number of intranuclear inclusions in the striatum of N171-82Q female mice. In contrast, this was not 
apparent in other brain areas examined. The failure to reach statistical significance in these studies could be due to 
the low number of mice analysed or the inaccuracy in detecting the real toxic species of mHtt that may be affected 
by CDNF. Notably, we did not see any noticeable difference in the number of nuclear vs cytoplasmic inclusions 
after CDNF treatment. It is clear that the nature and distribution of mHtt aggregates in different neurons and 
how these can be influenced by CDNF during the course of HD will require more investigations in the future. 
However, further development of the detection and quantifying method based on AI for analysis of aggregates 
in HD models or other neurodegenerative diseases where aggregates are presented is valuable. Moreover, this 
method could replace classical stereological but more biased and time-consuming methods.
Striatal cells that express mHtt have reduced activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and, which 
in turn can increase their vulnerability to ER  stress57. Previously, it was reported that CDNF is involved in the 
regulation of ER stress in vitro and in vivo in animal models of PD and  ALS22,24. It was reported that N171-
82Q mice had increased levels of ER stress markers (GRP78, CHOP and XBP1) in the s triatum58. Additionally, 
N-terminal mHtt fragments with longer polyQ tract (53Q-120Q) increased ER stress markers and induced cell 
death in vitro in PC6.3 neuronal c ells59. It has been reported that there is also an increase in the levels of GRP78 
and CHOP mRNA in brain tissues of HD  patients60. In our study, we observed a tendency towards an increased 
striatal expression of ER stress markers in N171-82Q mice as compared to WT mice and a lower expression 
levels of ER stress markers after CDNF treatment as compared to PBS treatment in N171-82Q mice. The most 
pronounced effect of CDNF was observed with CHOP mRNA, however, the data did not reach statistical sig-
nificance, possibly due to the low number of animals examined. Further experiments are therefore necessary to 
study ER stress and CDNF effects in these mice in the future using higher number of animals and probably also 
later endpoints than applied here.
BDNF is a NTF that has been linked to the pathophysiology of HD in different  models18,61. BDNF is antero-
gradely transported from cortical neurons to the s triatum62. We observed here that CDNF significantly increased 
the BDNF levels in cultured striatal neurons expressing mHtt with 109Q repeats. In contrast, there was no effect 
of CDNF in control cells expressing normal Htt with 7Q repeats. The underlying reason for this is unclear, but it 
is known that CDNF particularly influences neurons during cell stress, which is present in mHtt c ells23,43,54,57,59.
Most interestingly, in the present study, we also noted that the levels of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus 
were significantly lower in the N171-82Q mice than in WT controls. In contrast, we could not detect alterations 
in striatal and cortical BDNF mRNA levels between groups. Previously, a decrease of BDNF mRNA in the hip-
pocampus was also reported in the R6/1 mouse model of H  D63. The significance of reduced BDNF mRNA level in 
the hippocampus in HD is not clear at the moment, but may reflect an impairment of cognitive functions such as 
learning and memory. A previous study showed that CDNF is involved in long-term memory consolidation when 
administrated intrahippocampally in the mouse model of  AD64. We found that chronic CDNF administration 
significantly increased the mRNA level of hippocampal BDNF in N171-82Q mice as compared to PBS-treated 
N171-82Q mice. These data demonstrate the possible involvement of CDNF in the protection of cognitive func-
tions of the N171-82Q model of HD, particularly memory formation. To investigate this further behavioral tests 
are needed to study learning and memory performance after CDNF treatment in different HD mouse models. 
Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of how CDNF affects BDNF expression warrant investigation. It was previ-
ously reported that CDNF can induce pro-survival signaling in cells mediated by the IRE1α/XBP1 p athway23,33. 
Moreover, it has been shown that XBP1s can modulate BDNF levels in the  hippocampus65. This may be linked 
to our finding of an increased BDNF expression in the hippocampus by CDNF.
Previously some NTFs, such as glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NRTN) 
have been tested in the N171-82Q mouse model of HD and showed neuroprotective effects. However, in these 
studies GDNF and NRTN were delivered using AAV-delivery, which can limit future applications in clinical 
t rials13,14. The present study employing a chronic intrastriatal CDNF protein administration revealed beneficial 
effects of CDNF on the behavior and BDNF mRNA expression in the N171-82Q mouse model of HD. A pos-
sible influence of CDNF on mHtt inclusions and aggregate species is not clear from this study and will require

further studies. Along with this, more studies on the precise molecular and cellular mechanism by which CDNF 
alleviates neurodegeneration in HD models are also warranted.
Conclusions
We report here the beneficial effects of a chronic intrastriatal CDNF infusion on motor coordination in the 
transgenic N171-82Q mouse model of HD. In this study, CDNF did not decrease mHtt aggregates or ER stress 
markers in the striatum likely because of low amount of protein present. Unexpectedly in our study, we noted 
an increase in BDNF mRNA levels in the hippocampus in CDNF-treated N171-82Q mice as compared with 
PBS-treated N171-82Q mice, and there was also an upregulation after CDNF of BDNF in striatal neurons 
expressing mHtt. The present results on the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model together with our previous 
findings using the HD QA-acid toxin model emphasize the potential of CDNF as a potential drug candidate for 
the treatment of HD. As evident from this study, the use of a deep learning neural network approach is a useful 
and time-sparing method to quantify Htt aggregates and likely thereby also other protein inclusions present in 
other neurodegenerative disorders.
