27  Abstract 
28     
29  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection elicits both protein and lipid antigen-specific T cell 
30  responses. However, the incorporation of lipid antigens into subunit vaccine strategies and 
31  formulations has been under-explored, and the properties of vaccine-induced Mtb lipid-specific 
32  memory T cells have remained elusive. Mycolic acid (MA), a major lipid component of the Mtb cell 
33  wall, is presented by human CD1b molecules to unconventional T cell subsets.  These MA-specific 
34  CD1b-restricted T cells have been detected in the blood and disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals, 
35  suggesting that MA is a promising lipid antigen for incorporation into multicomponent subunit 
36  vaccines. In this study, we utilized the enhanced stability of bicontinuous nanospheres (BCN) to 
37  efficiently encapsulate MA for delivery in vivo to MA-specific T cells both alone and in combination 
38  with an immunodominant Mtb protein antigen (Ag85B). Pulmonary delivery of MA-loaded BCN 
39  (MA-BCN) elicited MA-specific T cell responses in humanized CD1 transgenic mice. Simultaneous 
40  delivery of MA and Ag85B within BCN activated both MA- and Ag85B-specific T cells. Interestingly, 
41  pulmonary vaccination with MA-Ag85B-BCN led to the persistence of MA, but not Ag85B, within 
42  alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vaccination of MA-BCN through intravenous or subcutaneous 
43  route, or with attenuated Mtb likewise reproduced MA persistence. Moreover, MA-specific T cells in 
44  MA-BCN-vaccinated mice differentiated into a T follicular helper-like phenotype. Overall, the BCN 
45  platform allows for the dual encapsulation and in vivo activation of lipid and protein antigen-specific T 
46  cells and leads to persistent lipid depots that could offer long-lasting immune responses.

47  Introduction 
48   
49  Vaccination is currently the most effective method for the prevention and eradication of 
50  infectious diseases. These efforts have been enhanced by the development of subunit vaccine 
51  formulations that include only immunodominant antigens from pathogens paired with select adjuvants. 
52  In contrast to attenuated and inactivated vaccines that contain diverse molecular components of 
53  pathogens, subunit vaccines are often preferred due to their simplicity, safety, stability, and scalability 
54  of production [1]. Yet the development of effective vaccines for several key endemic parasitic and 
55  bacterial pathogens has remained elusive. Antigen selection for subunit vaccines has thus far focused 
56  on protein molecules, overlooking a vast family of non-protein antigens such as lipids/glycolipids, 
57  metabolites, and phosphoantigens, which can be found on and within pathogens and can be recognized 
58  by various subsets of unconventional T cells [2]. 
59  Persistent antigen exposure is known to occur naturally after infection through antigen 
60  archiving by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which periodically present antigen to cognate B cells 
61  and aid in affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation [3, 4]. Antigen persistence can also support 
62  the maintenance of T cell response through the periodic priming of circulating T cells [5-10]. 
63  Subcutaneous vaccination has also been shown to lead to archiving of protein antigens within 
64  lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), which induce the development of protective T cell immunity [11, 
65  12]. However, little is known about how other vaccination routes and vaccine formulations may affect 
66  antigen archiving and persistence. 
67  Lipid and glycolipid antigens can be presented by group 1 (CD1a, b, and c) and group 2 
68  (CD1d) CD1 molecules to CD1-restricted T cells. Unlike MHC molecules, CD1 molecules exhibit 
69  limited polymorphism [13]. Therefore, CD1-restricted microbial lipid antigens are likely to be 
70  recognized by most individuals, making them attractive targets for vaccine development [14].  Group 1 
71  CD1-restricted T cells have diverse T cell receptors and can recognize a variety of lipid and glycolipid 
72  antigens [15]. Microbial lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been identified from several 
73  pathogens, including Mtb and other mycobacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Borrelia

74  burgdorferi, Salmonella typhimurium, and Brucella melitensis [15]. CD1b-restricted T cells specific to 
75  Mtb lipids including mycolic acid (MA), an immunodominant lipid antigen[16]  and component of the 
76  mycobacterial cell wall, have been identified in patients with tuberculosis (TB) [17, 18]. As group 1 
77  CD1 molecules are not expressed in mice, we have previously developed a human CD1 transgenic 
78  mouse model (hCD1Tg). [19] Using hCD1Tg mice, we have shown that transgenic CD1b-restricted 
79  DN1 T cells specific for MA could protect against Mtb infection [20], making these potential antigens 
80  of interest in a subunit vaccine against TB. 
81  The primary goal of a vaccine is to induce the differentiation of the adaptive immune system 
82  such that upon re-exposure to the antigen, a faster and larger response occurs, halting pathogen spread. 
83  While conventional T cells and B cells are known to undergo this differentiation, unconventional T 
84  cells such as NKT cells do not possess a comparable memory phenotype.  The presence of Mtb lipid-
85  specific group 1 CD1-restricted memory T cells has been described in both human and mice [17-19]. 
86  However, the properties of memory group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, which share similar developmental 
87  pathway as NKT cells, are not known.  
88  Lipid antigens are difficult to formulate and administer due to their hydrophobic nature. To 
89  assess the utility of MA as a component of a subunit vaccine, we previously encapsulated MA in 
90  poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) micellar nanocarriers (MA-MC) 
91  [21]. Nanocarriers composed of PEG-b-PPS possess several unique benefits compared to other 
92  delivery platforms, including high stability in aqueous solution [22], minimal background 
93  immunostimulation [23], and triggered release of cargo when exposed to physiological levels of 
94  reactive oxygen species [24-26]. We showed MA-MC could effectively activate adoptively transferred 
95  DN1 T cells and elicit polyclonal group 1 CD1-restricted T cell response in hCD1Tg mice after 
96  intranasal delivery [21]. While effective for stable loading of lipophilic and amphiphilic payloads, 
97  micellar nanocarriers, do not allow for facile encapsulation of hydrophilic payloads like protein 
98  antigens. 
99  Here, we build upon our prior lipid antigen vaccine formulation by employing a nanocarrier 
100  platform engineered for the dual loading of both lipid and protein antigens. Bicontinuous nanospheres

101  (BCN) are polymeric analogs to lipid cubosomes and thus possess a highly organized internal cubic 
102  organization containing both intertwined hydrophobic bilayers for lipid loading as well as hydrophilic 
103  aqueous channels for protein loading [27]. Using the flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) technique [28, 29], 
104  we fabricated MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN) and found them to have superior stimulatory capacity in 
105  vivo compared to MA loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanocarriers (MA-PLGA), 
106  which is a widely used nanocarrier platform for Mtb vaccine development [30, 31]. Furthermore, we 
107  found that after MA-BCN vaccination, MA could persist for 6 weeks post-vaccination within alveolar 
108  macrophages, a phenomenon which was dependent on the presence of an encapsulating vector, 
109  nanocarrier or bacterial, but not the route of vaccination. Due to the enhanced stability of the BCN 
110  architecture that can support the loading of diverse and multiple payloads [22, 32], we were able to 
111  efficiently co-encapsulate within BCN both MA and  Ag85B, an immunodominant protein antigen of 
112  Mtb [33].  Interestingly, while both antigens activated their corresponding antigen-specific T cells, 
113  only MA resulted in antigen persistence, suggesting a potentially unique characteristic of subunit 
114  vaccines containing lipid antigens.

115  Results 
116   
117  BCN morphology preserved after MA loading 
118    We scalably assembled spherical BCN with and without loaded MA using flash 
119  nanoprecipitation (FNP) as previously described [29].  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that 
120  both MA-BCN and BCN were consistent in size (364 ±19 nm and 354 ± 14 nm, respectively), and 
121  were monodisperse based on their polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 0.24 ± 0.04 and 0.21 ±0.05, 
122  respectively (Fig 1A). We next verified that the BCN formulation maintained its characteristic 
123  interconnected aqueous channels using cryogenic transmission electronic microscopy (cryo-TEM) (Fig 
124  1B) and negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig 1C). Using small angle X-ray 
125  scattering (SAXS) studies, we confirmed the internal cubic organization of BCN. Bragg peaks at the 
126  √2, √4, and √6 ratios show that the primitive type of cubic internal organization was preserved between 
127  MA-BCNs and BCNs (Fig 1D). Thus, MA encapsulation did not disturb the BCN architecture. We 
128  also manufactured a PLGA nanocarrier formulation (PLGA-NP) with and without MA encapsulation. 
129  PLGA-NP morphology were confirmed using cryoTEM (Suppl Fig 1A) and SAXS (Suppl Fig 1B) 
130  and the size of blank PLGA-NP and MA-loaded PLGA-NP (MA-PLGA) were found to be 169 ± 4 and 
131  163 ± 5 nm, respectively, with PDIs of 0.18 ± 0.04 and 0.19 ± 0.12, respectively (Fig 1E).  Using the 
132  coumarin derivatization method [21], we found that BCNs could more efficiently encapsulate MA than 
133  PLGA-NPs (Fig 1F). We previously noted that the highly stable cubic architecture of BCN can lead to 
134  the retention of cargo within the endolysosomal compartment [22]. Indeed, Texas Red-Dextran loaded 
135  BCN were mostly found in lysosomes while Texas Red-Dextran loaded PLGA-NP could be found 
136  both within the lysosome and cytosol of cells (Supp Fig 2A, B).  
137   
138  MA-BCN activate MA-specific T cells in vitro and in vivo 
139  As PLGA has served as a component of a wide range of vaccine formulations, including Mtb 
140  vaccines [30, 31], we benchmarked PEG-b-PPS BCN against PLGA-NP as a nanocarrier platform for 
141  lipid antigens. Both MA-BCN and MA-PLGA were highly effective in activating both mouse (DN1)

142  and human (M11) MA-specific T cells in vitro and inducing IFN-g production (Fig 2A-D). In 
143  particular, MA-BCN were significantly better at activating MA-specific T cells compared to free MA 
144  at equivalent concentrations (Fig 2A, B and D). In comparison to MA-BCN, MA-PLGA was 
145  significantly more effective at stimulating mouse MA-specific T cells in vitro at lower concentrations. 
146  Interestingly, even in the absence of MA, PLGA-NP showed strong stimulation particularly for M11 T 
147  cells. These results demonstrate that MA encapsulation within BCN enhances its ability to stimulate 
148  antigen-specific T cells and reveal a considerable background, and thus difficult to control, stimulatory 
149  effect of blank PLGA-NP.  In contrast, blank BCN showed little background immunostimulation [23], 
150  allowing a more controlled dose-dependent increase in T cell responses as the loaded MA 
151  concentration increased. 
152  We next tested the ability of MA-loaded and unloaded BCN and PLGA to stimulate DN1 T 
153  cells in vivo.  Intranasal (IN) vaccination of hCD1Tg mice was followed by the adoptive transfer of 
154  DN1 T cells. Surprisingly, we found that vaccination with MA-BCN induced a significantly higher 
155  percent of proliferation and activation in DN1 T cells than MA-PLGA in the draining lymph nodes 
156  (LN) and lungs at 1 week post-vaccination (Fig 2E-G). The extent of cell proliferation induced by 
157  MA-PLGA was not significantly different from that of blank PLGA (Fig 2F). Since MA-BCN 
158  effectively stimulated MA-specific T cells in vivo while MA-PLGA did not, we focused on further 
159  characterizing and assessing vaccination via solely MA-BCN formulations. 
160   
161  MA persists while Ag85B does not after vaccination with Ag85B-MA-BCN 
162  Given the lack of knowledge regarding BCN and lipid antigen kinetics, it would be of interest 
163  to test whether delivered antigen could persist in the mouse weeks post-vaccination (Fig 3A). We 
164  switched from intranasal vaccination to intratracheal (IT) vaccination, as it allowed for the reliable 
165  delivery of a larger volume of the vaccine. We found that a significant proportion of the adoptively 
166  transferred DN1 T cells could proliferate and become activated in the LNs, lung, and spleen of MA-
167  BCN-vaccinated mice 6 weeks post vaccination (Fig 3B-D). This activation and proliferation were

168  MA-specific, as no activation and proliferation of Ag85B-specific p25 Tg (p25) T cells were 
169  observed[34].  
170  Since BCN allow for the co-loading of lipid and protein antigens, we assessed the ability of 
171  dual loaded Ag85B-MA-BCN to activate antigen-specific T cells as well as lead to antigen persistence. 
172  We co-loaded Ag85B and MA in BCN and found Ag85B-MA-BCN to have a diameter of 380 nm and 
173  PDI of 0.223, comparable to MA-BCN (Fig 4A). Encapsulation efficiency was also relatively high at 
174  70%.Vaccination of hCD1Tg mice with Ag85B-MA-BCN activated and induced proliferation of both 
175  p25 and DN1 T cells in the LN, lung, and spleen (Fig 4B-D) at one-week post-vaccination. In addition, 
176  DN1 T cells were still able to be activated 6 weeks post-vaccination in the context of an Ag85B-MA-
177  BCN vaccination, while p25 T cells did not show increased activation or proliferation compared to 
178  blank BCN control at this time point (Fig 4E-H). Therefore, MA, but not Ag85B, appears to persist in 
179  the context of an Ag85B-MA-BCN vaccination. 
180   
181  MA persistence was dependent on encapsulation but not route of delivery or delivery vector  
182  To determine whether BCN encapsulation contributed to MA persistence, we designed an 
183  experiment that would allow direct comparison between MA-BCN and free MA. To account for their 
184  differential efficiency in stimulating DN1 T cells, we pulsed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells 
185  (BMDCs) from hCD1Tg mice with MA or MA-BCN at 10 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL MA concentration, 
186  respectively (Fig 5A). hCD1Tg mice were immunized with MA or MA-BCN-pulsed BMDCs at either 
187  1 week or 6 weeks before the adoptive transfer of DN1 T cells, allowing comparison of short-term vs. 
188  long-term vaccination conditions. We found that while there were no significant differences in DN1 T 
189  cell activation and proliferation between mice vaccinated with free MA and MA-BCN pulsed BMDCs 
190  at 1-week post-vaccination, after 6 weeks, DN1 T cell response could only be detected in the MA-BCN 
191  vaccination condition (Fig 5B, C). Thus, BCN encapsulation contributed to the persistence of MA. We 
192  then tested whether the BCN structure could contribute to antigen persistence by comparing PEG-b-
193  PPS BCNs to PEG-b-PPS MCs using a similar experimental set up (Suppl Fig 3). We found that MA-
194  BCN and MA-MC overall had similar ability to activate DN1 T cells in both short-term and long-term

195  vaccination time points (Suppl Fig 3B, C). Thus, the structure of the encapsulating NP did not play a 
196  significant role in antigen persistence of MA. 
197  To investigate if the IT route of vaccination played a role in the development of antigen 
198  persistence, we tested intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) vaccination routes with MA-BCN. DN1 
199  T cell activation and proliferation were detected at 6-weeks post-vaccination through both routes of 
200  vaccination (Fig 5D-F), suggesting that the antigen persistence is not unique to IT vaccination. To 
201  assess whether Mtb lipid antigen persistence could also be observed in mice vaccinated with an 
202  attenuated strain of Mtb, we vaccinated hCD1Tg mice SC with Mtb mc26206 strain and tested for the 
203  persistence of both Ag85B and MA after 6 weeks. The Mtb mc26206 strain displays less virulence in 
204  mouse studies than BCG but still confers long-term protection against virulent Mtb challenge 
205  equivalent to BCG[35].  We confirmed that no bacterial burden remained at the 6 weeks time point 
206  (Suppl Fig 4A). Similar to MA-BCN-vaccinated mice, DN1 T cells were activated and proliferated in 
207  the draining lymph nodes and spleen of mice vaccinated with the attenuated Mtb strain (Fig 5D-F). In 
208  line with our findings with BCN, no proliferation was seen in p25 T cells (Suppl Fig 4B-D). These 
209  results suggest that incorporation of MA in a nanocarrier vaccine allows for the mimicry of the lipid 
210  antigen persistence induced by vaccination with an attenuated Mtb vaccine. 
211   
212  MA persists within alveolar macrophages in the lung  
213   To identify the location of antigen persistence, we determined the biodistribution of BCN after 
214  IT vaccination using BCN loaded with the hydrophobic dye DiD (DiD-BCN). Since DiD is a lipophilic 
215  dye which, like MA, stably loads into the BCN bilayers, we could track the localization of BCN 
216  without having to perform additional chemical modifications. We found that IT-administered DiD-
217  BCN were located almost exclusively within the lung at all time points tested (4 h, 24 h, 48 h, 6 days, 
218  and 6 weeks) (Fig 6A). We were able to detect fluorescence through both in vivo imaging system 
219  (IVIS) and flow cytometry at 6-weeks post-vaccination that was significantly above unvaccinated 
220  control (Fig 6A, B), despite DiD quickly losing fluorescence upon mixture into aqueous environments 
221  [36], suggesting that some DiD-BCN structure remained intact at this time point. Flow cytometric

222  analysis (Suppl Fig 5) revealed that DiD BCN was primarily found within alveolar macrophages 
223  (AMs) at both early and late time points with neutrophils and DCs showing some fluorescence at early 
224  time points (4 and 24 h) (Fig 6C).  
225  We next tested whether MA likewise persisted primarily within AMs. 6-weeks after 
226  vaccination, we enriched for AMs using a column-based magnetic cell isolation system containing 
227  SiglecF antibody, which is highly expressed on AMs and a small population of eosinophils in the lung 
228  (Fig 6D). We co-cultured enriched AMs or the flow through with or without hCD1Tg-expressing 
229  BMDCs and DN1 T cells (Suppl Fig 6). While both enriched AM and flow through fractions from 
230  MA-BCN vaccinated mice co-culture with BMDCs could activate DN1 T cells (Fig 6E), co-culture 
231  with enriched AMs led to significantly higher DN1 T cell activation, suggesting AMs are the primary 
232  location of MA persistence. The ability of flow through to likewise lead to DN1 T cell activation 
233  suggests MA may also persist in other cell types or could be attributed to residual AMs in flow 
234  through.  Furthermore, AMs could not themselves present the MA to DN1 T cells, noted by the lack of 
235  T cell activation in the absence of BMDCs, suggesting that MA may be transferred from AMs to DCs 
236  for presentation. In fact, CD1b is not expressed on AMs [19, 37] and therefore the presence of CD1b-
237  expressing DCs may be necessary both in vitro and in vivo for T cell activation to occur. These data 
238  indicate that MA-BCN mainly persists within AMs in the lung after IT vaccination and CD1b-
239  expressing DCs is required for antigen presentation and activation of MA-specific T cells.  
240   
241  Vaccination leads to DN1 T cell differentiating into T follicular helper-like T cells 
242  To study the memory phenotype of DN1 T cells after MA-BCN vaccination, we constructed a 
243  mixed DN1 bone marrow (BM) chimera mouse model (DN1-hCD1Tg), since adoptively transferred 
244  DN1 T cells in unvaccinated mice cannot survive long term (Fig 7A). After vaccination, the percent of 
245  CD44+ DN1 T cells in the blood increased quickly and remained high until the last time point of 40 
246  days (Fig 7B). Various classical memory T cell subsets have been characterized 1 month after initial 
247  antigen-encounter, we therefore determined the DN1 T cell phenotype 6-weeks post vaccination. We 
248  found that the most prevalent memory population within DN1 T cells were CD44+CD62L+, markers

249  used to define central memory T cells, particularly in the LN (Fig 7C and Supp Fig 7A). To 
250  characterize the memory DN1 T cells, we performed RNA-seq analysis on sorted CD44+CD62L+ 
251  (memory) and CD44-CD62L+ (naïve) DN1 T cells from LNs of MA-BCN vaccinated DN1-hCD1Tg 
252  BM chimeric mice. We found that memory and naïve DN1 T cells clustered separately after principal 
253  component analysis (PCA), despite these samples coming from the same animals (Suppl Fig 7B). A 
254  total of 995 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified of which 542 upregulated and 453 
255  downregulated in the memory subset (Suppl Fig 7C). Next, we determined which T cell population 
256  memory DN1 T cells most resembled. Toward this end, we obtained data from ImmGen database 
257  (including terminally differentiated effector (Te), memory precursor (Tmp), central memory (Tcm), 
258  effector memory (Tem), regulatory (Treg))42, and two additional publications (follicular helper (Tfh)43, 
259  exhausted (Texh)44) and compared the respective DEG lists. Using PCA, we found that memory DN1 
260  T cells clustered most closely to Tfh, Treg, and Texh (Fig 7D) and when this subset is isolated, most 
261  closely to Tfh cells (Fig 7E).  
262  Within the DEGs, we noted upregulation of key Tfh cell transcription factors BCL6 and TCF1 
263  (TCF7), chemokines CXCR5 and CXCR4 and surface receptor ICOS, important for Tfh cell migration 
264  into the germinal center, and adaptor protein SAP (SH2D1A), important for T cell-dependent B cell 
265  immunity (Fig 7F)45. Inhibitory receptors PD-1 (PDCD1), TIGIT, CTLA4, and transcription factor 
266  EOMES, which are known to be expressed on Tfh cells were also upregulated. In addition, we 
267  observed downregulation of transcription factor KLF2, which can inhibit Tfh cell differentiation, and 
268  CCR7 and IL-7R, receptors known to have decreased expression in TFH cells. Consistent with our 
269  transcriptome analysis, we found increased percentage of CXCR5+PD-1+ DN1 T cells in MA-BCN 
270  vaccinated mice 6 weeks post-immunization (Fig 7G, H). Both our transcriptomic and experimental 
271  data highlighted that memory, but not naïve DN1 T cells, were proliferating, given the enrichment for 
272  the mitotic cell cycle process (Fig 7I) and increased KI67+ percentage within this population (Fig 7J). 
273  MA-BCN vaccination thus led to the differentiation of DN1 T cells into a proliferating Tfh-like T cell 
274  population.

276  Discussion 
277   
278  Research on the development of subunit vaccines containing lipid antigens is limited. This is in 
279  part due to a lack of research into appropriate lipid vaccine formulations and their associated 
280  properties. Some early evidence suggests that lipid vaccines could contribute to protection in Mtb 
281  challenge in guinea pig model [38, 39], which naturally express group 1 CD1 molecules [40]. 
282  Vaccination with a formulation composed of total Mtb lipid encapsulated within liposomes with either 
283  dimethyl-dioctadecyl-ammonium (DDA) and/or QS-21 adjuvants showed lower bacterial burden and 
284  pathology in lung and spleen compared to unvaccinated controls [38]. In another study, two Mtb lipids 
285  (diacylated sulfoglycolipids and the phosphatidylinositol dimannosides) encapsulated into liposomes 
286  formulated with DDA and trehalose dibehenate led to a decreased bacterial burden in the spleen and 
287  overall improved pathology in lung and spleen [39]. This work motivated our current study, where we 
288  used hCD1Tg mice that express human group 1 CD1 molecules, including CD1b and MA-specific 
289  (DN1), as well as p25-specific T cells to investigate the use of nanocarriers coloaded with both Mtb 
290  lipid and protein antigens during vaccination. 
291  We found that PEG-b-PPS BCN could effectively encapsulate MA as well as the protein 
292  antigen Ag85B to elicit activation of antigen-specific T cells in vaccinated mice (Fig 4). To our 
293  knowledge, this is the first time a dual protein and lipid loaded nanocarrier has been shown to 
294  effectively stimulate both lipid and peptide antigen-specific T cells simultaneously in vivo. PEG-b-PPS 
295  BCN can encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, making it an excellent platform for 
296  subunit vaccine delivery as both antigens and adjuvants can be co-loaded and delivered to the same 
297  cellular targets. Prior work on TB vaccines has shown that the inclusion of several protein antigens 
298  spanning the Mtb life cycle along with adjuvants with multiple boosts is paramount in the development 
299  of a vaccine that can provide effective protection against Mtb [30, 41]. As we have established that 
300  PEG-b-PPS BCN can easily incorporate a variety of payloads, future work will involve determining 
301  the optimal antigen and adjuvant combination for providing protection in a Mtb challenge experiment.

302  As several formulations of PLGA-NP have been approved for clinical uses [42], we compared 
303  MA encapsulated by either BCN or PLGA-NP and found that while PLGA appeared to offer greater, 
304  yet less controllable stimulation in vitro (Fig 2), BCN exhibited significantly greater efficacy in vivo 
305  (Fig 2). The result is not completely unexpected as a more fragile PLGA-NP could allow for fast 
306  intracellular release and antigen presentation in vitro while also leading to significant antigen loss prior 
307  to APC interaction in vivo [43]. Previous studies have documented PLGA’s innate pro-inflammatory 
308  effects, while other studies have highlighted the absence and suppression of inflammatory response 
309  [44-46]. In contrast and as previously observed for PEG-b-PPS nanocarriers [23], we showed that 
310  unloaded BCN have little inflammatory effect (Fig 2), allowing their immunomodulation to be dictated 
311  by the properties of the loaded antigen and adjuvant. Thus, PEG-b-PPS is a promising polymer for the 
312  formulation of subunit vaccines. 
313  We proceeded with a pulmonary (IN or IT) vaccination approach in this study based on 
314  emerging evidence that mucosal vaccination can induce a stronger immune response in the lung 
315  against Mtb in humans [47] and improve protection following  vaccination with nanocarriers in mice 
316  [48]. We found that in the pulmonary route of vaccination, BCN primarily were taken up and remained 
317  within alveolar macrophages in the lung (Fig 6). In fact, the ability of nanocarriers to target alveolar 
318  macrophages or other APCs may contribute to their distinct capacity for inducing antigen persistence, 
319  which was not seen with cellular carriers such as MA-pulsed BMDCs (Fig 5). Alveolar macrophages 
320  are the first line of defense of the lungs, responsible for keeping alveoli sterile by taking up inhaled 
321  particles and pathogens through phagocytosis [49-51].  Targeting these cells may be particularly 
322  beneficial in a TB vaccine design since they may also be the main site of Mtb latency [52]. While MA 
323  remained within alveolar macrophages in the lung, T cell activation appeared to occur prominently 
324  within the draining lymph nodes (Fig 2), suggesting that either MA was transported from the lungs to 
325  lymph nodes where the presentation took place or T cells activated in the lung migrated to the lymph 
326  nodes. The first option seems most likely, as CD1b-expressing DCs are more prevalent in the lymph 
327  nodes [53]. Furthermore, in Mtb infection models, it has been previously shown that apoptotic 
328  macrophage and vesicles could deliver mycobacterial antigens to DCs that then activate cognate T

329  cells [54, 55]. Similarly, we showed that alveolar macrophages from MA-BCN vaccinated mice could 
330  only lead to T cell activation in the presence of BMDCs from hCD1Tg mice (Fig 6). 
331  We demonstrated MA persistence in the lung 6 weeks post-vaccination using an in vivo antigen 
332  presentation assay with adoptive transfer of naïve MA-specific T cells. Sustained release of antigen 
333  through vaccination is thought to be key in the development of a robust adaptive immune response [56, 
334  57]. Recently, spike protein was found within the draining lymph nodes of vaccinated human subjects 
335  60 days after COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 [58]. In mice, pulmonary 
336  vaccination with adenovirus expressing influenza nucleoprotein supported long term maintenance of 
337  CD8 TRM (resident memory) cells [59]. Unlike in this work, antigen persistence did not occur after 
338  subcutaneous vaccination, suggesting a distinct mechanism of antigen archiving.  In a different vaccine 
339  model, subcutaneous administration of ovalbumin paired with adjuvants polyl:C and anti-CD40 led to 
340  antigen archiving by LECs [11, 12]. Similar to our findings, antigen-specific T cell activation required 
341  cross-presentation by DCs [11, 60]. Both LECs and FDCs retain antigens within a non-degradative 
342  compartment [11, 61], suggesting that residual antigens in our model may similarly remain in the 
343  endosome within undigested BCN. We have previously demonstrated the enhanced stability of BCN 
344  within cell endosomes in vitro for extensive periods of time [22].  This possibility is corroborated by 
345  the finding that DiD, which is easily quenched in aqueous solution [36], remained fluorescent 6 weeks 
346  post-vaccination (Fig 6). The lack of persistence for Ag85B could be due to its leakage out from the 
347  aqueous pores of BCN, which we have observed for other proteins [29]. Peptide antigens may be 
348  modified to include a hydrophobic tail for stable retention within BCN and therefore allow for peptide 
349  antigen persistence as well. MA’s extreme hydrophobic surface, which correlates with its low 
350  permeability as a part of Mtb cell wall, may also contribute to its prolonged persistence in vivo [62]. 
351  After infection and vaccination, peptide antigen persistence has been shown to occur through 
352  archiving by binding to CD21 receptors on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in lymph nodes [3, 4]. MA 
353  antigen persistence may likewise be a natural phenomenon that can occur after infections, although its 
354  detection may be difficult given the lack of available assays to detect very small amounts of lipid 
355  antigen. T cells may, in fact, be more sensitive than any commercially available tool. While we

356  determined that MA persists within alveolar macrophages after pulmonary vaccination, the exact 
357  location of persistence after SC, IV, or attenuated Mtb vaccinations remains to be tested. Overall, MA 
358  antigen persistence is a robust phenomenon which occurs independently of the vector and vaccine 
359  route of administration, and thus may play a role in the efficacy of a variety of vaccine strategies. 
360  Additional work will focus on whether lipid antigen persistence is found across the lipid family or 
361  specific to lipids with certain properties. 
362  The use of memory T cells in the setting of antigen persistence may be debatable, given that 
363  memory response has historically referred to the adaptive immune response in the setting of antigen 
364  clearance [63]. However, given that the persistence of MA occurs even in the setting of attenuated Mtb 
365  vaccination, Mtb lipid-specific long-term adaptive immunity will likely naturally exist in an antigen 
366  persistent environment. We found that DN1 T cells in this setting expressed key markers of Tfh cells 
367  such as CXCR5, PD-1, BCL6, and TCF1 (Fig 7). T cells differentiate into Tfh cells through the 
368  expression of master transcription factor regulator BCL6, which directs the upregulation of chemokine 
369  receptors CXCR5 and CXCR4 and thus migration into the germinal center[64, 65]. In the germinal 
370  center, Tfh cells provide help to B cells for affinity maturation and class switching. Other 
371  unconventional T cells are known to behave similarly such as CD1d-restricted NKT cells, which can 
372  acquire a Tfh  phenotype and provide B cell help through both cognate and non-cognate 
373  interactions[66]. Additional work will look at whether DN1 or other group 1 CD1-restricted T cells can 
374  functionally act as Tfh cells to provide B cell help, as may be suggested by the existence of IgG 
375  antibodies against MA and glycolipid lipoarabinomannan in TB patients [67-69]. 
376  While persistence of protein antigen has been shown to improve the quality of protective 
377  immunity [7, 11, 70, 71], it is not yet known how lipid antigen persistence may affect the protective 
378  efficacy of lipid-specific T cells. At the very least, antigen persistence increases the probability of T 
379  cell/DC encounters by increasing the time that the antigen is available. Additional work will need to 
380  address the function of lipid-specific T cells differentiated in antigen persistent environments. As the 
381  ultimate goal of this work is to improve the efficacy of existing subunit vaccines, future work will

386  Ethics statement  
387  This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use 
388  of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the 
389  Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University (Protocol number: 
390  IS000011717).

392  Poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (propylene sulfide) polymer synthesis 
393  Poly (ethylene glycol)17-block-poly-(propylene sulfide)75 (PEG17-b-PPS75) copolymer was synthesized 
394  as previously reported [72, 73]. Briefly, monomethoxy PEG (molecular weight=750 Da) was 
395  functionalized with mesyl chloride and substituted with thioacetate to produce a PEG acetate initiator 
396  for the polymerization for PPS.  
397   
398  Bicontinuous nanosphere fabrication via flash nano precipitation 
399  BCN were produced using FNP technique as previously described[72]. In brief, PEG17-b-PPS75 BCN 
400  polymer and any hydrophobic cargo was dissolved in THF and loaded onto a syringe. The hydrophilic 
401  cargo was loaded onto a separate syringe, and both impinged against one another through the confined 
402  impingement mixer into scintillation vial. The vial was placed in a vacuum desiccator overnight to 
403  remove the organic solvent. NPs were filtered through LH-20 column with PBS as an eluent and 
404  suspended in PBS for later use. MA encapsulation efficiency was analyzed using coumarin 
405  derivatization as previously described [21]. MA was loaded at a concentration of 100 µg/mL of total 
406  BCN formulation and DiD was loaded at 5 µg/mL total BCN formulation. MA loading capacity in 
407  BCNs was 2%. To measure the encapsulation efficiency of Ag85B, Ag85B-MA-BCN were 
408  centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected and concentrated using 
409  Amicon® Ultra-4 10K centrifugal filter devices. To determine the unencapsulated protein

411  manufacturer protocol and the absorbance was measured at 660 nm using a SpectraMax M3 multi-
412  mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, LLC). The percentage encapsulation efficiency was 
413  calculated as a percent of encapsulated protein to the total amount of protein added. Ag85B was 
414  encapsulated at a concentration of 140 µg/mL and loading capacity was found to be 2.88%. 
415   
416  Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticle (NP) fabrication  
417  PLGA-NP were prepared by the Oil-in-Water single emulsion method. Briefly, PLGA (20 mg in 800 
418  µL dichloromethane) organic phase was emulsified using an ultrasonic processor with aqueous phase 
419  containing 2 mL of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution (2.5% w/v) to form an emulsion. The emulsion 
420  was then added dropwise into 4 mL of stirring 0.5% w/v PVA solution at room temperature to 
421  evaporate the organic solvent. NPs were collected after 4 hours of stirring followed by centrifugation at 
422  10,000 x g for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, NPs were washed twice with cold water to remove 
423  residual PVA and redispersed in PBS. Hydrophilic (Texas red-Dextran) or hydrophobic (MA) loading 
424  was performed by adding the payloads to the aqueous and organic phases, respectively. 
425   
426  Nanocarrier characterization 
427  The nanocarrier size (z-average diameter) and polydispersity was measured using dynamic light 
428  scattering (DLS) using a Nano 300 ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, U.K.). BCN and 
429  PLGA morphology was visualized with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) as 
430  previously detailed [21]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to image BCN 
431  using uranyl acetate as a negative stain as previously reported [22]. BCN aggregate structure and 
432  internal morphology was characterized with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). These studies were 
433  performed at the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team beamline at Argonne 
434  National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source with 10 keV (wavelength λ = 1.24 Å) collimated X-
435  rays, as described previously[72].

467  isolated from lymph nodes (axial, brachial, submandibular, inguinal) of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/Rag-/- mice. 
468  The supernatant was used for IFN-g enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed as 
469  described previously [21] and cells were stained for activation. 
470   
471  In vitro nanoparticle and lipid titration with human cells via ELISPOT assay 
472  Hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride 96-well plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were coated with anti-
473  human IFN-γ mAb 1-D1K (Mabtech, Cincinnati, OH) diluted 1:400 in PBS (Gibco, Waltham, MA) 
474  and incubated at 4°C overnight. The following day, mAb was removed and each plate was washed and 
475  incubated at room temperature for 2 hours in the presence of media. Human monocyte-derived 
476  dendritic cells and MA-specific M11 T cells were seeded 50,000 cells and 2,000 cells per well, 
477  respectively, together with serially diluted MA and NPs. After 16-hour incubation, plates were washed 
478  and incubated with biotinylated anti-human IFN-g (7-B6-1), diluted 1:3000 in PBS + 0.5% FBS, for 4 
479  hours. Plates were then washed with PBS 5 times and incubated for 2 hours with ExtrAvidin-Alkaline 
480  phosphatase diluted 1:1000 in PBS + 0.5% FBS. Spots were visualized after incubation with the

483  Mouse vaccination 
484  For both intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) vaccination, mice were anesthetized using inhaled 
485  isoflurane. For IN vaccination, 25 µL of liquid was administered at the nostrils of the mice for a total 
486  of 1 µg of MA per mouse. For IT vaccination, mice were administered 25 or 50 µL of liquid for a total 
487  of 2.5 µg of MA with or without 2.0 µg of Ag85B. For BMDC vaccinations, hCD1Tg BMDCs were 
488  cultured in GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days[74] and pulsed with MA-BCN (5 µg/mL of MA) or free MA 
489  (10 µg/mL of MA) for 24 hours. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and IT vaccinated at a

494   Attenuated Mtb strain (H37Rv DpanCD DleuCD referred to as mc2 6206) was kindly provided by 
495  Jacobs’ Laboratory at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Bacteria were grown as previously 
496  described in supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 media [35, 75]. Mice were vaccinated subcutaneously 
497  with 1x106 CFU in 100 µL of PBS. Mycobacterial burden quantification was performed by plating 
498  serial dilutions of lung or spleen homogenate on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates [35, 75].

501  DN1 or p25 T cells were isolated from lymph nodes of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/Rag-/- or P25Tg/Rag-/- mice, 
502  respectively. Cells were labeled with CellTrace™ Violet reagent (Invitrogen™) as per manufacturer's 
503  instructions and 3-5x106 cells were injected into hCD1Tg mice either 1 day before vaccination (short 
504  term) or 6 weeks post-vaccination (long term). On day 7 post-adoptive transfer, draining lymph nodes 
505  (axial, brachial, mediastinal), lung, and spleen were obtained. Single-cell suspensions were prepared 
506  by mechanical disruption in HBSS/2% FBS. The lung was digested with collagenase IV (1mg/ml; 
507  Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase I (30µg/ml; Sigma- Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37oC before the disruption.  
508   
509  Biodistribution imaging 
510  BCN were loaded with DiD dye (Thermo Fisher) and administered to mice IT at 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 
511  hours, 6 days, and 6 weeks prior to the final time point, at which all mice were sacrificed and analyzed 
512  together. Lung, spleen, and draining lymph nodes were harvested and imaged using a near-IR in vivo 
513  Imaging System (IVIS; Center for Advanced Molecular Imaging, Northwestern University). The 
514  single-cell suspension was then prepared from indicated organs and cells were stained for flow 
515  cytometric analysis. 
516   
517  Alveolar macrophage enrichment and T cell co-culture 
518  hCD1Tg mice were immunized IT with either BCN or MA-BCN (2.5 µg of MA/mouse).  6 weeks 
519  later, lungs were isolated and single-cell suspension was stained with anti-SiglecF-PE (E50-2440, BD 
520  Bioscience). SiglecF-positive cells were enriched using anti-PE MultiSort Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). 1x105

521  flow through and AM enriched fractions were co-cultured with 1x105 hCD1Tg BMDCs and 3x105 
522  DN1 T cells for 48 hours and cells were stained for the expression of activation markers. 
523   
524  Generation and vaccination of BM chimeras 
525  Bone marrow cells from DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/Rag-/- (CD45.2) and hCD1Tg mice (CD45.1) were depleted of 
526  mature T cells using anti-Thy-1.2 (AT83.A-6) plus rabbit complement (Cedarlane Laboratories). Equal 
527  numbers of cells (5x106) were adoptively transferred into hCD1Tg (CD45.1) mice irradiated with 900 
528  rads. After 6 weeks, BM chimeric mice were intratracheally vaccinated with either 2.5 µg of MA in 
529  MA-BCN or equivalent volume of PBS and the activation status of DN1 T cells were monitored in the 
530  blood 1-2 times per week until experiment completion. 
531   
532  RNA-Seq analysis 
533  CD44+CD62L+ and CD44-CD62L+ DN1 T cells were sorted from LNs of DN1-hCD1Tg BM chimera 
534  mice vaccinated with MA-BCN at 6 weeks post vaccination by BD FACS Aria with purity >98%. 
535  RNA was extracted with RNAeasy® mini kit (Qiagen). Libraries were generated by using the Illumina 
536  Truseq preparation kit and sequenced on HiSeq4000. Reads were analyzed with Ceto pipeline 
537  (https://github.com/ebartom/NGSbartom) using STAR and HTseq for alignment on mm10 mouse 
538  genome and reading counting, as described previously [76]. Paired differential expression analysis was 
539  performed using DESeq2 to account for original mouse sourcing[77]. All downstream analysis was 
540  performed in R and figured generated using ggplot. Gene enrichment analysis was performed using 
541  Metascape [78]. Comparisons to other T cell profiles were performed using raw transcriptome data 
542  from ImmGen database[79], and two additional publications for follicular helper (TFH)[80], exhausted 
543  (Texh)[81]. Analysis was performed as described above to obtain gene expression fold change values 
544  relative to internal naïve condition.

913  Fig. 6. Persistent MA remains in part due to encapsulation inside alveolar macrophages and 
914  activates T cells through DCs. B6 or hCD1Tg mice were IT vaccinated with BCN loaded with a 
915  hydrophobic fluorescent dye (DiD) at 6 weeks, 6 days, 48 hours, 24 hours, or 4 hours prior to the 
916  experiment. LN, lung, and spleen were analyzed using (A) In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS).  Single cell 
917  suspension was then obtained and presence of DiD BCN was quantified in (B) total lung, and (C) 
918  CD45- cells, neutrophils (Ly6G+), alveolar macrophages (CD11c+SiglecF+), DCs (CD11c+), monocytes 
919  (CD11b+CD11c-), B cells (CD19+), T cells (CD3+), NK cells (NK1.1+), eosinophils (CD11c-SiglecF+) 
920  by flow cytometry. Gating strategy exemplified in Suppl Fig 4. hCD1Tg mice were IT vaccinated with 
921  either BCN or MA-BCN. After 6 weeks, alveolar macrophages were enriched from lungs using anti-
922  SiglecF. Enriched or flow through cells were co-cultured with DN1 T cells in the presence or absence 
923  of hCD1Tg-expressing BMDCs for 48 hours, and DN1 T cells activation was measured. (D) 
924  Experimental design. (E) Percentage of CD25-expressing DN1 T cells. Data represented as mean ± 
925  SEM. Statistical analysis: 2-way ANOVA. ns = not significant, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. 
926   
927  Fig. 7. MA-BCN vaccination leads to DN1 T cell differentiation into T follicular helper-like T 
928  cells. Mixed bone marrow chimeric mice were created by adoptive transfer of DN1 bone marrow and 
929  congenic CD45.1 hCD1Tg bone marrow to irradiated hCD1Tg mice. After 5 weeks, mice were 
930  vaccinated with either MA-BCN or PBS, and DN1 surface marker expression was monitored in the 
931  blood and in organs at 6 wks. (A) Experimental design. (B) Percent CD44+ DN1 T cells in the blood at 
932  various time points post vaccination. (C) Percent CD44+CD62L+ DN1 T cells in indicated organs at 6 
933  weeks post vaccination. Memory (CD44+CD62L+) and naïve (CD44-CD62L+) DN1 T cells were sorted 
934  from MA-BCN vaccinated hCD1Tg-DN1 BM chimeras at 6 weeks post vaccination and subjected to 
935  RNAseq analysis. N=3 per condition (D, E) PCA of log fold change of gene expression for each T cell 
936  subset was performed relative to internal naïve T cell control. (F) Relative expression of key TFH cell 
937  and DEGs in memory subset. (G) Gene enrichment analysis of upregulated DEGs was performed 
938  using Metascape. (H) Representative FACS plots of DN1 T cells in the LN of mice. Percentage of (I) 
939  CXCR5+PD1+ or (J) KI67+ DN1 T cells DN1 T cells in LN, lung, and spleen. N = 3-5 per condition.
