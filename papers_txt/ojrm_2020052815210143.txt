1. Introduction 
The practical design of medical devices such as wound dressing and tissue an-
ti-adhesive  product  is  found  by  understanding  the  general  wound  healing 
process. Wound dressings are applied to external wounds, while tissue an-
ti-adhesive products are applied to internal wounds. However, both medical de-
vices should be designed to have a common function that facilitates the wound 
healing process [1] [2] [3] [4]. The wound dressings need to facilitate the healing 
process under the impaired conditions such as burn injury and intractable skin 
ulcer. In case of tissue anti-adhesive products, two events need to proceed si-
multaneously. One is to promote wound healing of surgically resected tissue 
surface. Another is to prevent surgically resected tissue surface from adhering to 
the surrounding tissue surface. The superior performance of wound dressing 
and tissue anti-adhesive product depends on the properties of the material itself. 
HA is identified as a major extracellular component. Because of its unique hy-
groscopic,  rheological  and  viscoelastic  properties,  HA  creates  an  excellent 
wound healing environment. HA is an important biomaterial for wound healing 
as it has various biological activities [5] [6]. Col is a primary connective tissue 
component, providing strength and integrity to all tissues. Col is also an impor-
tant biomaterial for wound healing as it has various biological activities [7]. 
Based on such a concept, various types of wound dressings and tissue an-
ti-adhesive products have been developed by using HA and Col [8] [9] [10] [11]. 
The spongy sheet composed of HA and Col is dissolve in water. Therefore, the 
intermolecular crosslinks of this spongy sheet need to be controlled to provide 
superior performance as medical devices. The purpose of this study is to provide 
useful information in developing medical devices such as wound dressing and 
tissue anti-adhesive product, using a spongy sheet composed of HA and Col. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Manufacture of Spongy Sheet Composed of HA and Col 
HA powder (Bio Sodium Hyaluronate HA 20, molecular weight; 2000 kDa) was 
purchased from Shiseido (Tokyo, Japan). Col power derived from porcine skin 
was purchased from Nippon Meat Packers (Osaka, Japan). HA powder (30 g)

was dissolved in distilled water (DW) (2000 mL) under stirring using a 15 cm 
diameter screw propeller at a speed of 1 revolution per second at 20˚C overnight 
to obtain HA aqueous solution (pH 6.8). Col power (6 g) was dissolved in DW 
(400 mL) under stirring using a 9 cm screw propeller at a speed of 2 revolutions 
per second at 20˚C overnight, and then warmed at 60˚C for 60 minutes to obtain 
Col aqueous solution (pH 2.8). This Col aqueous solution is referred to as 
heat-denatured Col aqueous solution. This Col aqueous solution was mixed with 
HA aqueous solution by stirring and then adjusted to neutral conditions (pH 7.0 
- 7.2) by dropping NaOH aqueous solution. This mixture (60 mL) was poured 
into a plastic tray (10 cm × 12 cm) and refrigerated at 4˚C for 6 hours, and then 
was frozen at −85˚C overnight, followed by freeze vacuum drying to obtain a 
spongy sheet. This spongy sheet is referred to as Sponge-A (ratio of HA/Col = 
5/1). In a similar manner, another spongy sheet was manufactured. HA powder 
(18 g) was dissolved in DW (1200 mL). Col powder (18 g) was dissolved in DW 
(1200 mL). The spongy sheet was manufactured using the mixture of both solu-
tions. This spongy sheet is referred to as Sponge-B (ratio of HA/Col = 5/5). Both 
sides of the spongy sheet were irradiated using a 15 W ultraviolet lamp with a 
wavelength of 253.7 nm at a distance of 20 cm to introduce intermolecular cros-
slinks between Col molecules. Sponge-A treated with UV irradiation for 5, 10, 15 
minutes is referred to as Sponge-A-5, Sponge-A-10, Sponge-A-15, respectively. 
Sponge-B treated with UV irradiation for 5, 10, 15 minutes is referred to as 
Sponge-B-5, Sponge-B-10, Sponge-B-15, respectively. This spongy sheet was cut 
to a size of 3.5 cm × 5.5 cm for use in immersion tests. 
2.2. Weight and Size Change of Spongy Sheet   
after Immersion in Water 
The weight change of spongy sheet was determined by immersing a peace of 
spongy sheet (size: 3.5 cm × 5.5 cm, weight: 0.2 g) in a container filled with DW 
(200 mL) at 37˚C. The hydrated spongy sheet collected 1/2, 1, 3, 7 days after 
immersion in water was frozen at −85˚C overnight, followed by freeze vacuum 
drying to obtain a spongy sheet. The weight of each spongy sheet was measured 
and compared with its original weight. In addition, the size of each spongy sheet 
was calculated and compared with its original size. The outline of each spongy 
sheet was traced on a clear plastic film, and then the weight of cut film was con-
verted to size using the correlation measurements of the film weight and size. 
2.3. Enzymatic Degradation of Spongy Sheet by Collagenase 
Collagenase (0.008 g or 0.016 g) was dissolved in DW (1600 mL), and then this 
solution (200 mL) was poured in eight containers. The enzyme concentration 
was adjusted to 0.0005% (w/v) and 0.001% (w/v). The weight change of spongy 
sheet was determined by immersing a peace of Sponge-A-15 or Sponge-B-15 
(size: 3.5 cm × 5.5 cm, weight: 0.2 g) in a container filled with DW (200 mL) 
containing collagenase at 37˚C. The hydrated spongy sheet collected 6, 8, 10, 12

hours after immersion in water was frozen at −85˚C overnight, followed by 
freeze vacuum drying to obtain a spongy sheet. The weight of each spongy sheet 
was measured and compared with its original weight. 
2.4. Statistical Evaluation 
Data are expressed as means ±standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Student’s t-test for comparison between two groups. Each experi-
ment was conducted 8 times and evaluated (n = 8). 
3. Result 
3.1. Manufacture of Spongy Sheet Composed of HA and Col 
Prior to manufacturing spongy sheet, the characteristics of Col aqueous solution 
were examined. The Col concentration was adjusted to 1.5% (w/v). The viscosity 
of Col aqueous solution was measured at the range from 20˚C to 60˚C using a 
standard viscometer. This viscometer rotates the cylindrical part in the solution 
and measures the rotating top surface resistance at each temperature. The vis-
cosity was 19.3, 17.2, 13.3, 4.2, less than 0.1, less than 0.1 dPa∙s at 20˚C, 25˚C, 
30˚C, 35˚C, 40˚C, 60˚C, respectively. The Col aqueous solution was warmed at 
60˚C, and then cooled to 20˚C. Under these conditions, the viscosity at 20˚C was 
0.4 dPa∙s. This heat-denatured Col aqueous solution does not cause precipitation 
even at neutral conditions (pH 7.0 - 7.2). The heat-denatured Col aqueous solu-
tion can be mixed with HA aqueous solution without causing any precipitation. 
This mixture was adjusted to neutral conditions at 20˚C. The spongy sheet was 
manufactured by freeze vacuum drying this clear mixed solution. The both side 
of spongy sheet was irradiated by UV lamp to introduce intermolecular cros-
slinks between Col molecules. The spongy sheet slightly turns yellow when UV 
irradiation period is more than 10 minutes. 
In this study, two types of spongy sheets were manufactured. One is Sponge-A 
(ratio of HA/Col = 5/1). Another is Sponge-B (ratio of HA/Col = 5/5). In a pre-
liminary experiment, other types of spongy sheets were manufactured. The 
spongy sheet (ratio of HA/Col = 10/1) failed to collect after immersion in water, 
because of inadequate intermolecular crosslinks between Col molecules. There-
fore, Sponge-A was chosen as a product with the lowest Col content. On the 
other hand, the spongy sheet (ratio of HA/Col = 2/5) is not soft. Therefore, 
Sponge-B was chosen as a product with the appropriate softness. This study can 
provide useful information in production of spongy sheet having appropriate 
softness and appropriate intermolecular crosslinks between Col molecules. Ac-
cording to this information, other spongy sheet having appropriate ratio of 
HA/Co ranged from 5/1 to 5/5 can be manufactured responding to clinical re-
quirements. In addition, the concentration of HA and Col aqueous solution was 
chosen at 1.5 w/v% to obtain spongy sheet having appropriate softness. When 
the concentration of HA and Col aqueous solution is 1.0 w/v%, the manufac-
tured spongy sheet is too soft. This spongy sheet is not suitable for operability in 
clinical use.

3.2. Weight and Size Change of Spongy Sheet   
after Immersion in Water 
The weight change of Sponge-A or Sponge-B was measured 1/2, 1, 3, 7 days after 
immersion in water at 37˚C. The weight of Sponge-A-5 was 59.1%, 56.2%, 
47.2%, 46.2% of the original weight, respectively. The weight of Sponge-B-5 was 
73.6%, 68.6%, 56.5%, 58.5% of the original weight, respectively (Figure 1). The 
weight of Sponge-A-10 was 61.3%, 57.2%, 53.0%, 54.7% of the original weight, re-
spectively. The weight of Sponge-B-10 was 75.2%, 76.8%, 72.8%, 68.2% of the orig-
inal weight, respectively (Figure 2). The weight of Sponge-A-15 was 63.5%, 62.1%,

78.3%, 76.7%, 79.1%, 71.9% of the original weight, respectively (Figure 3). There 
is no statistical difference among four data, 78.3%, 76.7%, 79.1%, and 71.9%. The 
findings shown in Figure 3 indicate that Sponge-B-15 having the highest inter-
molecular crosslinks rate can control the decrease in weight within about 72% of 
the original weight for 7 days immersion in water. 
The size change of Sponge-A or Sponge-B was measured 1/2, 1, 3, 7 days after 
immersion in water at 37˚C. The size of Sponge-A-5 was 194%, 218%, 239%, 
238% of the original size, respectively. The size of Sponge-B-5 was 142%, 181%,

sponge-B-10 was 145%, 133%, 174%, 197% of the original size, respectively 
(Figure 5). The size of sponge-A-15 was 170%, 176%, 208%, 221% of the origi-
nal size, respectively. The size of Sponge-B-15 was 128%, 147%, 142%, 146% of 
the original size, respectively (Figure 6). There is no statistical difference among 
four data, 128%, 147%, 142%, and 146%. The findings shown in Figure 6 indi-
cate that Sponge-B-15 having the highest intermolecular crosslinks rate can con-
trol the increase in size within about 150% of the original size for 7 days immer-
sion in water.

Sponge-A-15 collected 6, 8, 10, 12 hours after immersion in water was 65.7%, 
59.8%, 57.9%, 55.2% of the original weight, respectively. Spongy sheets failed to 
collect after 24 hours because of enzymatic degradation. Under the condition of 
0.001% collagenase concentration, the weight of Sponge-A-15 collected after 6 
and 8 hours after immersion in water was 57.6 and 40.7 of the original weight, 
respectively (Figure 7). Spongy sheet failed to collect after 10 hours because of 
enzymatic degradation. 
Under the condition of 0.0005% collagenase concentration, the weight of 
Sponge-B-15 collected 6, 8, 10, 12 hours after immersion in water was 63.5, 52.1, 
42.0, 43.2% of the original weight, respectively. Spongy sheets failed to collect 
after 24 hours because of enzymatic degradation. 
Under  the  condition  of  0.001%  collagenase  concentration,  the  weight  of

to collect after 12 hours because of enzymatic degradation. 
4. Discussion 
There are two important issues in the manufacturing process of the spongy sheet 
composed of HA and Col. The first issue in the manufacturing process is how to 
mix HA and Col to prepare a clear aqueous solution under neutral conditions. 
Col aqueous solution can be prepared under acidic conditions below pH 3. 
When changed to the neutral region, Col molecules with a triple helical structure 
aggregate and partially precipitate. This phenomenon is considered as follows. 
Col molecule side chains change from charged state to neutral state. As a result, 
Col molecule side chains weaken bonding to surrounding water molecules.

These conditions facilitate side-by-side arrangement of Col molecules having a 
triple heliacal structure like a rod-like structure, thereby causing aggregation and 
precipitation. When Col aqueous solution is warmed above 40˚C, Col molecules 
undergo a conformational change from triple helical structure to random coil 
structure. This phenomenon reflects a decrease in viscosity. The results in this 
study demonstrated that the viscosity was 19.3, 17.2, 13.3, 4.2, less than 0.1 dPa∙s 
at 20˚C, 25˚C, 30˚C, 35˚C, 40˚C, respectively. Once Col aqueous solution is 
warmed at 60˚C, and then cooled to 20˚C, the viscosity at 20˚C showed 0.4 dPa∙s. 
This finding indicates that a random coil structure does not return to its original 
helical structure. The random coil structure inhibits side-by-side arrangement of 
Col molecules due to mutual steric hindrance. As a result, this heat-denatured Col 
aqueous solution can be kept transparent without causing any precipitation even 
under neutral conditions. Consequently, this heat-denatured Col aqueous solu-
tion can be mixed with HA aqueous solution under neutral conditions without 
causing any precipitation. This property of Col molecule is advantageous in 
manufacturing medical devices composed of HA and Col. 
The second important issue in the manufacturing process is how to control 
the intermolecular crosslinks of spongy sheet. A spongy sheet composed of HA 
and Col is dissolve in water. In practical use, intermolecular crosslinks are re-
quired to control its water solubility. The general method for introducing inter-
molecular crosslinks is to use chemical cross-linking reagents having epoxy 
group such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether. This method needs to remove 
unreacted chemical cross-linking reagents after manufacturing a spongy sheet by 
freeze vacuum drying process. After rinsing a spongy sheet by immersion in wa-
ter, the hydrated spongy sheet needs a second freeze vacuum drying process.

This second process is disadvantageous in mass production. To overcome such 
disadvantages,  this  study  adopted  a  method  that  does  not  use  chemical 
cross-linking reagents. It is well known that intermolecular crosslinks between 
Col molecules is introduced by UV irradiation. This method is very useful in 
mass production. In this case, the second freeze vacuum drying process de-
scribed above can be omitted. The results in this study demonstrate that heat- 
denatured Col molecules with random coil structure can be also cross-linked by 
UV irradiation. This property of Col molecule is also advantageous in manufac-
turing medical devices composed of HA and Col. 
The manufactured spongy sheet is considered to have the unique structure, 
where HA molecules are entrapped in an intermolecular cross-linked network 
structure of Col molecules. When immersed in water, HA molecules are able to 
extract gradually from the Col network structure. When immersed in water 
containing collagenase, the weight loss of spongy sheet is accelerated by easy ex-
traction of HA molecules from the enzymatic degraded Col network structure. 
In practice, the weight of Sponge-B-15 collected 1/2 and 1 day after immersion 
in water was 78.3% and 76.7% of the original weight, respectively. On the other 
hand, the weight of Sponge-B-15 collected 1/2 day after immersion in water 
containing 0.0005% collagenase was 43.2% of the original weight. This spongy 
sheet failed to collect 1 day after immersion, because of enzymatic degradation. 
These results indicate that the intermolecular cross-linked Col network structure 
is decomposed by collagenase within 1 day, thereby the extraction of HA mole-
cules is facilitated. In other words, these findings suggest the unique structure, 
where HA molecules are entrapped in an intermolecular cross-linked network 
structure of Col molecules. 
The Co content in Sponge-A and Sponge-B is 16.7% and 50.0%, respectively. The 
intermolecular crosslinks rate in Sponge-A-5 is lower than that in Sponge-B-15, 
because the crosslinks rate depends on Col content and UV irradiation time. 
When immersed in water, Sponge-A-5 has reduced weight and increased size 
compared to Sponge-B-15. In practice, the weight change of Sponge-A-5 and 
Sponge-B-15 collected 1 day after immersion in water was 56.2% and 76.7% of 
the original weight. The size of Sponge-A-5 and Sponge-B-15 collected 1 day af-
ter immersion in water was 218% and 147% of the original size. When intermo-
lecular crosslinks rate is low, HA molecules extract easily form the Col network 
structure, thereby causes weight loss. In addition, the Col network structure be-
comes loose and causes an increase in size (Figure 9). The results demonstrated 
that the size of Sponge-A-15 and Sponge-B-15 collected 1 day after immersion in 
water was 176% and 147% of the original size. These findings also suggest the 
unique  structure,  where  HA  molecules  are  entrapped  in  an  intermolecular 
cross-linked network structure of Col molecules (Figure 10). 
The wound dressings need to facilitate the healing process under the impaired 
conditions such as burn injury and intractable skin ulcer. Spongy sheet needs to 
provide the scaffold for new tissue formation. Therefore, the spongy sheet with

high Col ratio and high intermolecular crosslinks rate like Sponge-B-15 is ex-
pected to show excellent performance as wound dressings. In case of tissue an-
ti-adhesive products, two events need to proceed simultaneously. One is to 
promote wound healing of surgically resected tissue surface. Another is to pre-
vent surgically resected tissue surface from adhering to the surrounding tissue 
surface. The surgically resected tissue surface proceeds under normal wound 
healing process. The main performance of tissue anti-adhesive products is to 
prevent surgically resected tissue surface from adhering to the surrounding tis-
sue surface. Therefore, the spongy sheet with low Col ratio and low intermole-
cular crosslinks rate like Sponge-A-5 is expected to show excellent performance

as tissue anti-adhesive products, because easy extraction of HA molecules pro-
vides an environment to prevent tissue adhesion. In addition, the highly hy-
drated, enlarged spongy sheet caused by extraction of HA molecules is expected 
to provide an advantageous environment to prevent tissue adhesion. 
Further development of this research is to explore a wide range of potential 
application of cell growth factors using the spongy sheet of HA and Col. In our 
previous study, wound dressings composed of HA and Col containing epidermal 
growth factor (EGF) were developed [8] [9]. It is well known that EGF is a po-
tent stimulator of cell proliferation of various cells including keratinocytes, fi-
broblasts, and vascular endothelial cells [12] [13] [14]. This wound dressing was 
manufactured by freeze vacuum drying aqueous solution of HA and Col con-
taining EGF to manufacture a spongy sheet, followed by UV irradiation to in-
troduce crosslinks between Col molecules. The efficacy of this wound dressing 
was investigated in clinical trials. Most clinical cases were assessed as having 
achieved good or excellent results [10]. The manufacturing process of this 
wound dressing is very practical. However, the activity of EGF is expected to re-
duce to some extent by UV irradiation. When use other unstable cell growth 
factors, the reduction of activity by UV irradiation is a problem to be solved. The 
best way to overcome such problems is to laminate two different spongy sheets. 
The first spongy sheet is manufactured by freeze vacuum drying an aqueous so-
lution of HA and Col, and followed by UV irradiation to introduce intermole-
cular crosslinks between Col molecules. The second spongy sheet is manufac-
tured by freeze vacuum drying an aqueous solution of HA containing cell 
growth factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth 
factor or hepatocyte growth factor. These cell growth factors are known to be the 
most potent cytokines for the promotion of wound angiogenesis [15] [16] [17] 
[18]. The first cross-linked spongy sheet on top and the second non-cross-linked 
spongy sheet containing cell growth factor on bottom are laminated to prepare a 
two-layered spongy wound dressing (Figure 11). Both spongy sheets can be

laminated with only slight pressure, because the surface of both spongy sheets 
has porous structure with soft physical properties. In particular, non-cross- 
linked spongy sheet of HA containing cell growth factor has very soft physical 
properties [19] [20]. 
5. Conclusion 
The spongy sheet with high Col ratio and high intermolecular crosslinks rate is 
expected to show excellent performance as wound dressings, because the Col 
network structure provides an environment to facilitate new tissue formation. 
On the other hand, the spongy sheet with low Col ratio and low intermolecular 
crosslinks rate is expected to show excellent performance as tissue anti-adhesive 
products, because easy extraction of HA molecules provides an environment to 
prevent adhesion between tissues.
