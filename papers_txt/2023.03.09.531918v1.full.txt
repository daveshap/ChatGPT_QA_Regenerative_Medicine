Summary 
Ophiobolin A (OPA) is a sesterterpenoid fungal natural product with broad anti-cancer activity. While OPA 
possesses multiple electrophilic moieties that can covalently react with nucleophilic amino acids on proteins, 
the proteome-wide targets and mechanism of OPA remain poorly understood in many contexts. In this study, 
we used covalent chemoproteomic platforms to map the proteome-wide reactivity of OPA in a highly sensitive 
lung cancer cell line. Among several proteins that OPA engaged, we focused on two targets—cysteine C53 of 
HIG2DA and lysine K72 of COX5A—that are part of complex IV of the electron transport chain and contributed 
significantly to the anti-proliferative activity. OPA activated mitochondrial respiration in a HIG2DA and COX5A-
dependent manner, led to an initial spike in mitochondrial ATP, but then compromised mitochondrial 
membrane potential leading to ATP depletion. We have used chemoproteomic strategies to discover a unique 
anti-cancer mechanism of OPA through activation of complex IV leading to compromised mitochondrial 
energetics and rapid cell death.

Introduction 
Natural products isolated from microbes, plants, and other living organisms have been a major source 
of therapeutics; they, and their derivatives, constitute 50-70% of the drugs used for the treatment of bacterial 
and fungal infections, inflammation, diabetes, and cancer 1–4. Among bioactive natural products there exist a 
subset of molecules that possess reactive electrophilic centers that can covalently react with nucleophilic 
amino acid residues on proteins ,thus imparting therapeutic activity 5. Examples of such molecules include: i) 
lipstatin and penicillin which feature reactive β-lactone or -lactam warheads; ii) anti-cancer agents epoxomicin 
and fumagillin that harbor reactive epoxides; and iii) the anti-cancer agent Wortmannin that covalently modifies 
PI3 kinase 3,6. Beyond these examples, there are many other electrophilic natural products that show anti-
cancer activity but their direct targets and mechanisms are poorly understood.  
Ophiobolin A (OPA) is a phytotoxic fungal-derived sesterterpenoid natural product that has been shown 
to possess anti-proliferative activity across dozens of cancer cell types, often with sub-micromolar potency 
(Figure 1a) 7. OPA was originally isolated from the fungus Ophiobolus miyabeanus in 1958 by Ishibashi and 
Nakamura and its structure and stereochemistry were reported in 1965 7. While OPA was initially characterized 
as a calmodulin inhibitor in plants 8,9, more recent studies have demonstrated that OPA impairs breast cancer, 
leukemia, glioma, and glioblastoma viability among other tumor cell lines 1. These findings have made 
ophiobolin sesterterpenes attractive targets for total synthesis and chemical probe development 10–14. The 
cytotoxic effects of various ophiobolin members have been attributed to the perturbation of numerous biological 
molecules, cell signaling nodes, and cell death pathways 15–25,  and are suggestive of context-specific 
mechanisms of cell killing 24. Given OPA’s known ability to engage lysine residues of calmodulin in Schiff base 
formation 8, covalent chemistry – involving both lysine and cysteine – has also been implicated in OPA 
bioactivity 25–28.  
Various studies have observed that OPA causes morphological and functional changes to mitochondria 
although the detailed mechanisms underlying these perturbations are unclear 19,20,29. One potential mechanism 
that has been invoked is the covalent inhibition of human calmodulin by OPA 18,30. Another more thorough 
mechanistic study of OPA using a functional genomic screen revealed that reducing de novo synthesis of the 
membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) mitigated OPA toxicity through reducing cellular PE levels in 
cancer cells. In this study by Chidley et al, the authors showed that OPA forms pyrrole-adducts with the 
phosphoethanolamine headgroup leading to membrane destabilization and cancer cell death 26. While these 
studies all support the premise that OPA exhibits interesting anti-cancer activity that stems from alterations in 
mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, the direct proteome-wide mapping of OPA protein targets remain 
understudied. OPA possesses multiple electrophilic moieties that can covalently react with nucleophilic amino 
acids on proteins, including cysteines and lysines, and multiple MOAs may contribute to its cytotoxic effects in 
a context-dependent manner. In this study, we profiled the anti-cancer activity of OPA across a panel of cancer 
cell lines and then used covalent chemoproteomic platforms to map the proteome-wide cysteine and lysine 
reactivity of OPA in a highly OPA-sensitive lung cancer cell line. We demonstrate how OPA covalently targets

several proteins including two targets involved in the electron transport chain, leading to impaired mitochondrial 
metabolism and energetics and anti-cancer effects.   
 
 
Results 
  To identify human cancer cell lines that are particularly sensitive to OPA, we screened 283 tumor cell 
lines of diverse origin. We found that the lung squamous cell carcinoma line NCI-H1703 showed the lowest 50 
% growth inhibitory (GI ) value across the screened cell lines with a GI  of 0.17 µM (Figure 1b; Table S1). 
50 50
We subsequently performed a more thorough dose-response of OPA on NCI-H1703 cell proliferation in serum-
containing media and compared these data to the effects on cell viability with the C-6 epimer of OPA and the 
anhydro C-6 epimer of OPA, 6-epi-OPA and anhydro-6-epi-OPA, respectively (Figure 1c-1d). These data 
demonstrated that OPA is significantly more sensitive in impairing NCI-H1703 cell proliferation with an EC  of 
50
0.54 µM compared to 6-epi-OPA and anhydro-6-epi-OPA with EC values of 3.7 and 4.0 µM, respectively 
50 
(Figure 1d). These data are consistent with the large majority of biological studies involving ophiobolins 
wherein OPA often shows greater cytotoxicity than its epimeric and anhydro counterparts 7.  Additionally, 
administration of OPA at concentrations that impaired cell proliferation did not affect total cellular PE levels as 
determined by phospholipidomics (Figure S1).   
  To identify the direct targets and potential mechanisms of this natural product, we next used isotopic 
tandem orthogonal proteolysis activity-based protein profiling (isoTOP-ABPP) chemoproteomic profiling 
approaches to map the cysteine and lysine reactivity of OPA in NCI-H1703 cells using previously established 
cysteine and lysine-reactive probes and methods 31–34. Across >2900 cysteines and >1000 lysines profiled, we 
identified 8 cysteine targets and 2 lysine targets that showed control versus OPA-treated probe-modified 
peptide ratios of greater than 2 with an adjusted p-value of <0.05 indicating significant engagement of these 
targets by >50 % (Figure 1e-1f). These targets included C374 of farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 
(FDFT1), C100 of Ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), C63 of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 
(HNRNPA3), C247 of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 (GGPS1), C29 of Ras-related protein (RAB21), 
C511 of 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 (PHYH2), C127 of triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1), C53 of 
mitochondrial HIG1 domain family member 2A (HIGD2A), K72 of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A (COX5A), 
and K292 of beta-actin-like protein 2 (ACTBL2) (Figure 1e-1f, Table S2, and Table S3). These targets 
spanned several different protein classes and pathways, including FDFT1 in the cholesterol biosynthesis 
pathway, GGPS1 in the protein prenylation and geranylation pathway, TPI1 in glycolytic metabolism, and 
COX5A and HIGD2A in complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Interestingly, COX5A and 
HIG2DA are both part of the same protein complex in the electron transport chain. We hypothesized that OPA 
may be disrupting mitochondrial metabolism and function through direct targeting of COX5A and HIG2DA.  
  We first sought to biochemically confirm the interactions of OPA and their derivatives with the identified 
targets using gel-based ABPP approaches competing OPA or OPA derivative binding against a rhodamine 
conjugated cysteine or lysine-reactive probe labeling of pure protein (Figure 2a-2f, Figure S2) 32,35. OPA 
showed dose-dependent binding to HIG2DA and COX5A via competition against cysteine and lysine-reactive

probe labeling, respectively (Figure 2a-2f). We also demonstrated OPA binds to RAB21, FDFT1, and GGPS1 
(Figure S2). Interestingly, 6-epi-OPA and anhydro-6-epi-OPA did not bind, or bound poorly, to HIGD2A and 
COX5A compared to OPA (Figure 2a-2f). These results were consistent with our cell viablity data showing that 
6-epi-OPA and anhydro-6-epi-OPA were less inhibitory to NCI-H1703 cell proliferation compared to OPA. We 
next used an alkyne-functionalized OPA probe (OPA-alkyne) to demonstrate direct, covalent, and dose-
dependent labeling of pure COX5A and HIG2DA protein which was outcompeted by excess OPA (Figure 2g-
2i)28. To further demonstrate target engagement in cells, we also showed enrichment of HIG2DA and COX5A 
from NCI-H1703 cells treated with the OPA-alkyne probe compared to vehicle-treated controls, upon 
subsequent copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with an azide-functioned biotin enrichment 
probe, avidin pulldown, and blotting for targets (Figure 2j-2k). We further noted that unrelated proteins such as 
GAPDH were not pulled down with OPA-alkyne (Figure 2j-2k).  
  To understand the targets most responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of OPA, we next performed 
genetic validation studies. We demonstrated that individually knocking down the expression of COX5A, 
HIG2DA, RAB21, FDFT1, and GGPS1 all led to significant attenuation in OPA-mediated anti-proliferative 
effects (Figure 3a-3d; Figure S2). Among these targets HIG2DA and COX5A knockdown both showed 
particularly significant resistance to OPA-mediated effects, indicating their larger importance among the targets 
(Figure 3a-3d). Given that both HIG2DA and COX5A are in the same protein complex and knocking down one 
of these two targets may facilitate compensation by the other target, we also demonstrated significant 
attenuation of the anti-proliferative effects of OPA upon dual HIG2DA and COX5A knockdown (Figure 3e-3g). 
Based on these genetic validation data, we placed the remainder of our focus on further investigating HIG2DA 
and COX5A as targets of OPA.  
 We next performed Seahorse metabolic studies monitoring mitochondrial oxygen consumption, a 
measure of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. We showed that OPA activated mitochondrial 
oxygen consumption, suggesting that the targeting of HIG2DA and COX5A by OPA may activate these 
proteins in the complex IV of the electron transport chain (Figure 4a). This enhancement in mitochondrial 
respiration was fully attenuated upon HIG2DA and COX5A knockdown and OPA in this case even has an 
inhibitory effect (Figure 4b). This inhibitory effect may be through OPA interactions with another target that 
leads to inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism that is unmasked upon HIGD2A and COX5A knockdown. Based 
on these data, we hypothesized that OPA may over-activate mitochondrial electron transport and mitochondrial 
oxidative respiration leading to increased generation of reactive oxygen stress that would compromise the 
mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation, as has previously been shown with dysfunctional 
mitochondria and mitochondrial oxidative stress in cancer 36. Consistent with this premise, we observed an 
initial dramatic spike in mitochondrial ATP levels during the first hour of OPA treatment likely due to complex IV 
activation by OPA targeting of HIG2DA and COX5A (Figure 4c). OPA treatment eventually led to significant 
impairment in mitochondrial membrane potential, more than known mitochondrial electron transport chain 
inhibitors or uncouplers (Figure 4d). Subsequently, OPA treatment ultimately led to the collapse of 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a near total loss of mitochondrial ATP production by 3 
hours of treatment (Figure 4c).

Discussion 
In this study, we used covalent chemoproteomic platforms to map the proteome-wide cysteine- and 
lysine-reactivity of the electrophilic anti-cancer natural product OPA, revealing unique targeting of COX5A and 
HIG2DA within complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This led to an over-activation of 
mitochondrial respiration, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and ultimately the collapse of 
mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production. Our genetic validation studies suggest that COX5A and 
HIG2DA are major contributors to OPA-mediated anti-proliferative effects and that the stimulation in 
mitochondrial metabolism is mediated through these targets as well. While there are many natural products, 
such as rotenone and oligomycin that inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain, our data point to OPA 
uniquely activating the mitochondrial electron transport chain leading to an unusual ATP spike, followed by a 
metabolic collapse. Our studies may also explain the mechanism underlying previous reports of OPA causing 
mitochondrial dysfunction 20,29. We note that our mechanism is likely one of several additional mechanisms that 
may underlie OPA effects, including previous reports that OPA inhibits human calmodulin 18,30, or that OPA can 
directly form pyrrole adducts with PE to destabilize membranes in certain cell lines 26. Taken more broadly, our 
study once again highlights the utility of using covalent ABPP chemoproteomic platforms with electrophilic and 
biologically active natural products to uncover unique mechanisms of anti-cancer activity 37–39, and open up the 
future possibility of exploiting such intriguing therapeutic modalities with more synthetically tractable chemical 
matter.

STAR Methods 
Chemicals. OPA was purchased from Millipore Sigma, Anhydro-6-epi-OPA was purchased from Cayman 
Chemicals. 6-epi-OPA was from previously published work 12. OPA alkyne probe was prepared according to 
known methods 28.  
 
Cell Culture  
NCI-H1703 and HEK293T cells was obtained from UC Berkeley’s Biosciences Divisional Services Cell Culture 
Facility. NCI-H1703 cells were cultured in RPMI and HEK293T cells were cultures in DMEM media. Both 
media types contained 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), were supplemented with 1% glutamine, and were 
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. For shRNA knockdowns, cell specific media were supplemented with heat 
inactivated 10% FBS and with 1% glutamine. 
 
Cellular Phenotype Studies  
Cell proliferation assays were conducted using Hoechst 33342 dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) as previously 
described. NCI-H1703 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning 3904) at 25,000 cells per 150 µL of 
media and were left overnight to adhere. Cells were treated with 50µL of media containing 1:250 dilution from 
a 1000x DMSO compound stock and treated for 24hrs. After the incubation period, media with treatment was 
removed and 100 µL of diluted Hoechst 33342 dye in 10% formalin was added to each well and incubated at 
room temperature and in the dark for 15 minutes. Afterwards, the staining solution was removed and wells 
were washed with 100 µL of PBS twice. Prior to imaging, 100 µL of PBS was added to each well.  
 
In situ Competitive Mass Spec ABPP Chemoproteomic Studies  
Competitive isoTOP-ABPP studies were done as previously reported 34,40. Cells were treated with either DMSO 
or 3µM of OPA for 4 hours. Each treatment group were harvested separately; cells were lysed by probe 
sonication in PBS and protein concentrations were measured by BCA assay. For both DMSO and OPA treated 
samples, 8 samples (at a concentration of 2 mg/mL) were aliquoted. Four DMSO and 4 OPA samples were 
treated with either 200 µM iodoacetamide-alkyne (IA-alkyne) probe or 500 µM lysine-reactive NHS-ester-
alkyne probe and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. CuAAC was used by sequential addition of 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (1 mM, Sigma), tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (34 μM, Sigma), 
copper (II) sulfate (1 mM, Sigma), and biotin-linker-azide—the linker functionalized with a TEV protease 
recognition sequence as well as an isotopically light or heavy valine for treatment of control or treated 
proteome, respectively. After CuAAC, proteomes were precipitated by centrifugation at 6500 × g, washed in 
ice-cold methanol, combined in a 1:1 control/treated ratio, washed again, then denatured and resolubilized by 
heating in 1.2 % SDS/PBS to 80°C for 5 minutes. Insoluble components were precipitated by centrifugation at

6500 × g and soluble proteome was diluted in 5 ml 0.2% SDS/PBS. Labeled proteins were bound to avidin-
agarose beads (170 μl resuspended beads/sample, Thermo Pierce) while rotating overnight at 4°C. Bead-
linked proteins were enriched by washing three times each in PBS and water, then resuspended in 6 M 
urea/PBS (Sigma) and reduced in TCEP (1 mM, Sigma), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IA) (18 mM, Sigma), 
then washed and resuspended in 2 M urea and trypsinized overnight with 0.5 μg/μl sequencing grade trypsin 
(Promega). Tryptic peptides were eluted off. Beads were washed three times each in PBS and water, washed 
in TEV buffer solution (water, TEV buffer, 100 μM dithiothreitol) and resuspended in buffer with Ac-TEV 
protease and incubated overnight. Peptides were diluted in water and acidified with formic acid (1.2 M, 
Spectrum) and prepared for analysis. Isotopically light and heavy probe-modified peptides were analyzed by 
two dimensional LC-LC-MS/MS using a Thermo qExactive plus MS. 
 
Mass Spectrometry Analysis 
Peptides from all chemoproteomic experiments were pressure-loaded onto a 250 μm inner diameter fused 
silica capillary tubing packed with 4 cm of Aqua C18 reverse-phase resin (Phenomenex # 04A-4299) which 
was previously equilibrated on an Agilent 600 series HPLC using gradient from 100% buffer A to 100% buffer 
B over 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minutes wash with 100% buffer B and a 5 minutes wash with 100% buffer 
A. The samples were then attached using a MicroTee PEEK 360 μm fitting (Thermo Fisher Scientific #p-888) 
to a 13 cm laser pulled column packed with 10 cm Aqua C18 reverse-phase resin and 3 cm of strong-cation 
exchange resin for isoTOP-ABPP studies. Samples were analyzed using an Q Exactive Plus mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 5-step Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology 
(MudPIT) program, using 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 80 %, and 100 % salt bumps of 500 mM aqueous ammonium 
acetate and using a gradient of 5–55 % buffer B in buffer A (buffer A: 95:5 water:acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid; 
buffer B 80:20 acetonitrile:water, 0.1 % formic acid). Data was collected in data-dependent acquisition mode 
with dynamic exclusion enabled (60 s). One full MS (MS1) scan (400–1800 m/z) was followed by 15 MS2 
scans (ITMS) of the nth most abundant ions. Heated capillary temperature was set to 200°C and the 
nanospray voltage was set to 2.75 kV. 
Data was extracted in the form of MS1 and MS2 files using Raw Extractor 1.9.9.2 (Scripps Research Institute) 
and searched against the Uniprot human database using ProLuCID search methodology in IP2 v.3 (Integrated 
Proteomics Applications, Inc). Cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for 
carboxyaminomethylation (+57.02146) and up to two differential modifications for methionine oxidation and 
either the light or heavy TEV tags. Probe-modified isotopically light or heavy differential modifications will be 
searched against cysteine modifications using m/z +464.26597 and +470.29977 for IA-alkyne; and against 
lysine modifications using m/z +494.26013 and +500.27394 for NHS-ester alkyne. Peptides were required to 
be fully tryptic peptides and to contain the TEV modification. ProLUCID data was filtered through DTASelect to 
achieve a peptide false-positive rate below 5%. Only those probe modified peptides that were evident across 
two out of three biological replicates were interpreted for their isotopic light to heavy ratios. For those probe-

modified peptides that showed ratios >2, we only interpreted those targets that were present across all three 
biological replicates, were statistically significant, and showed good quality MS1 peak shapes across all 
biological replicates. Light versus heavy isotopic probe-modified peptide ratios were calculated by taking the 
mean of the ratios of each replicate paired light vs. heavy precursor abundance for all peptide spectral 
matches (PSM) associated with a peptide. The paired abundances were also used to calculate a paired 
sample t-test p-value in an effort to estimate constancy within paired abundances and significance in change 
between treatment and control. P-values were corrected using the Benjamini/Hochberg method. 
 
Bacteria Culture  
In-house bacterial stocks and bacterial glycerol stocks purchased from Milipore Sigma (TRCN0000045961, 
TRCN0000234702, SHC016, SHC216, TRCN0000048127, TRCN0000045788, and TRCN0000304161) were 
cultured in LB overnight at 200rpm at 37C.  
 
Plasmid Isolation 
E. coli containing desired plasmids were pelleted, lysed, and neutralized using commercially available QIAprep 
Spin Miniprep’s (catalogue no. 27104) user manual. Plasmid elutes’ concentration were determined using 
Nanodrop quantification. 
 
shRNA Knockdown Studies 
Prior to HEK293T transfection, 3ug of each lentiviral plasmids—gene of interest(s), psPAX2 (carries GAG, 
REV, polgenes), and pMD2G (carries VSVG pseudotyping gene)— were diluted in 750µL of Gibco™ Opti-
MEM™ I Reduced Serum Medium (catalogue no.31985-062). Lipofectamine 2000 (catalogue no.11668027) 
was also diluted in 750µL Opti-MEM. Both dilutions sat undisturbed at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to 
being mixed together and added to a 15cm plate of HEK293T cells. The following day, media was removed 
and replenished with fresh media. 72 hours after transfection (infection day), the viral soup was collected from 
HEK293T cells using 10mL luer lock syringes and filtered through a 0.45µM filter. An equal volume of target 
cell line media was added. Polybrene (catalogue no. TR-1003-G) in 1:1000 dilution was added. This lentiviral 
mixture was then added to the target cells. Following day, media was removed and replenished. 48 hours after 
infection, cells were selected on puromycin for 72 hours.

Group Inc., 60004–1-Ig), and α-Tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, 3873S), were obtained from various 
commercial sources and dilutions were prepared per recommended manufacturers’ procedures. Proteins were 
resolved by SDS/ PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the BioRad system (1704159). 
Blots were blocked with 5 % BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) solution for 1 hour at 
room temperature, washed in TBST, and probed with primary antibody diluted in recommended diluent per 
manufacturer overnight at 4°C. Following washes with TBST, the blots were incubated in the dark with 
secondary antibodies purchased from Ly-Cor and used at 1:10,000 dilution in 5% BSA in TBST at room 
temperature. Blots were visualized using an Odyssey Li-Cor scanner after additional washes. If additional 
primary antibody incubations were required the membrane was stripped using ReBlot Plus Strong Antibody 
Stripping Solution (EMD Millipore, 2504), washed and blocked again before being reincubated with primary 
antibody. 
 
Gene Expression RTqPCR 
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and aqueous solution was 
processed using QIAgen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalogue no. 74104). cDNA was synthesized using Qiagen 
Quantitect Reverse Transcription (205311) and gene expression was confirmed by qPCR using the 
manufacturer’s protocol Power SYBR Green Master Mix 2X concentration (4368577) on the CFX Connect 
Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad). Primer sequences for Fisher Maxima SYBR Green were derived 
from Primer Bank. Sequences of primers are as follow: 
COX5a Forward: GGC TTA GGG GAC TGG TTG TC 
COX5a Reverse: CCG TAA GAG GGC TTG GCT AC 
PPIA (Cyclophilin) Forward: CCC ACC GTG TTC TTC GAC ATT  
PPIA (Cyclophilin) Reverse: GGA CCC GTA TGC TTT AGG ATG A 
 
Gel Based ABPP 
Gel-based ABPP methods were performed as previously described34. Recombinant pure human proteins were 
purchased from Origene: COX5A (TP306046), HIGD2A (TP301223), FDFT1 (TP301392), GGPS1 
(TP302699), and RAB21 (TP310510). Pure proteins (0.2 μg) were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle or 
covalently-acting small molecules for 30 minutes at 37oC in an incubation volume of 25 μL PBS, and were 
subsequently treated with Tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide (Setareh) (IA-rhodamine) for 
1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then diluted with 10 μL of 4 × reducing Laemmli SDS 
sample loading buffer (Alfa Aesar) and heated at 90°C for 5 minutes. The samples were separated on precast 
4–20% TGX gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Prior to scanning by ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc),

assessed by densitometry using ImageJ. 
 
In Situ OPA-Alkyne Probe Labeling and Biotin-Azide Pulldown 
OPA-alkyne probe was prepared according to known methods 28. Experiments were performed following an 
adaption of a previously described protocol. NCI-H1703 were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or 5μM OPA 
alkyne probe for 4hours. Cells were harvested in PBS and lysed by sonication. Following instructions if for a 
sample of n=1 (this procedure was done in n=3 for pull down validation and TMT analysis). For preparation of 
Western blotting sample, 195 μL of lysate (4 mg/ml) was aliquoted per sample to which 25 μL of 10% SDS, 5 
μL of 5 mM biotin picolylazide (900912 Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 μL of click reaction mix (3 parts TBTA 5 mM 
TBTA in butanol:DMSO (4:1, v/v), 1 part 50 mM Cu(II)SO  solution, and 1 part 50 mM TCEP). Samples were

incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with gentle agitation after which 1.2 mL ice cold acetone were added. After 
overnight precipitation at −20 °C, samples were spun in a prechilled centrifuge at 1250 x g for 10 minutes 
allowing for aspiration of excess acetone and subsequent reconstitution of protein pellet in 200 μL PBS 
containing 1% SDS by probe sonication. At this stage, total protein concentration was determined by BCA 
assay and samples were normalized to a total volume of 230 μL, with 30 μL reserved as input. 20 μL of 
prewashed 50% streptavidin agarose bead slurry was added to each sample and samples were incubated 
overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation. Supernatant was aspirated from each sample after 
spinning at 90 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature. Beads were transferred to spin columns and washed 3× 
with PBS. To elute, beads were boiled 5 minutes in 50 μL LDS sample buffer. To elute, beads were boiled 5 
minutes in 50 μL SDS sample buffer. Eluents were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by 
immunoblotting.  
 
Agilent Seahorse Metabolic Testing  
80,000 cells per well were seeded in Agilent cell culture microplate and incubated in 37°C at 5% CO  
2
overnight. Probe sensitization, assay buffer preparation, and program settings were followed as suggested by 
Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit’s (catalogue number 103015-100) user guide. After the cells adhered, 
cells were treated with compound for 30 min. Oligomycin, FCCP, and Rotenone/ Antimycin A was added at a 
final concentration of 2.5 µM, 2 µM, and 0.5 µM, respectively.

Real-Time ATP Rate Assay  
40,000 cells per well were seeded in Agilent cell culture microplate and incubated in 37°C at 5% CO2 
overnight. Probe sensitization, assay buffer preparation, and “induced” program settings were followed as 
suggested by Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit’s user guide (catalogue no. 103592-100). Oligomycin and 
Rotenone/ Antimycin A was added at a final concentration of 1.5 µM and 0.5 µM, respectively.  
 
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay 
Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using Mitoprobe TMRM (Thermo Fisher M20036). NCI-
H1703 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning 3904) at 25,000 cells per 150 µL of media and were left 
overnight to adhere. Cells were treated with 50 µL of media containing 1:250 dilution from a 1000x DMSO 
compound stock and treated for 2 h. After the incubation period, media was spiked with TMRM to have a final 
concentration of 150 nM and incubated for 30 min. Afterwards, the media with TMRM was removed and wells 
were washed with 100 µL of PBS twice. Prior to imaging, 100 µL of PBS was added to each well.  
 
Lipidomics 
NCI-H1703 cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells in 10 cm dishes overnight. The following day, 
cells were treated with either vehicle control or OPA for 4 hours at 37°C with 5% CO . Cells were then 
2
harvested, pelleted, and stored on dry ice. Cell pellets were extracted in 3 ml of 2:1:1 
chloroform:methanol:water with the addition of 1 nmoles of internal standards—dodecylglycerol (positive 
ionization mode) and pentadecanoic acid (negative-ionization mode). Phases were separated by centrifugation 
and bottom organic phase was collected, dried under a stream of nitrogen and subsequently the dried extract 
was resuspend in 120 µL of chloroform. This sample was transferred to a glass mass spectrometry vial for 
subsequent lipidomic analysis by single-reaction monitoring based LC-MS/MS using a 6460 Agilent QQQ-LC-
MS/MS using previously established methods 41.
