1. Introduction 
As of 6:30 on April 20, Beijing time, the novel coronavirus pneumonia cases 
were diagnosed in 2 million 390 thousand cases, totaling 2,394,291 cases, and the 
cumulative death rate was more than 160 thousand cases, 164,938 cases in total, 
according to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University. 
Up to now, novel coronavirus pneumonia has not yet been found to be a spe-
cific therapeutic drug. However, it is reported that the new coronavirus is very 
sensitive to heat, and it can be inactivated at 56˚C for 30 minutes [1]. New coro-
naviruses have a preference for cold environments. The lower temperature, the 
longer the survival time, and they can even survive for several years [2] at a 
temperature of minus 60˚C. In addition, the new coronavirus was also reported 
to prefer humid and enclosed environments.  
Although the virus is sensitive to temperature, we have not seen the use of 
thermal methods against coronavirus, until today. Tests have proved that, when

the temperature of the human body is 37.5˚C, the visceral vitality was enhanced 
by 5 - 6 times [3]. With the body temperature of 37˚C, the blood circulation is 
good, while the basic metabolism is reduced by 12% at 36.5˚C and the immune 
function is reduced by 37% at 36˚C. So, we have to find a way to improve the 
body’s immunity by increasing the body’s temperature. Here, we exemplify these 
thermal related treatment methods including: far infrared heating, inhalation of 
thermal air, alternative oxygen and hydrogen therapy, mixture of ozone and air, 
physical plasma treatment, etc. 
2. Treatment Plan Options 
2.1. Treatment Plan with New Ventilator 
The novel ventilator of this solution is to kill the virus by increasing the temper-
ature of the inhaled gas and mixing some micro-ozone. In general, the tempera-
ture of people’s inhaled air depends on the ambient temperature, usually 20˚C. 
The temperature of exhaled gas is about 36˚C, almost the same as that of health 
human body. Normally, the resting adult respiratory cycle time is about 6.4 
seconds, and the average breath volume is about 500 ml per breath. Calculated 
according to thermal formula (Q = cm(T − T), where c is the air specific heat 
2 1
capacity, m is the air mass, T is the air temperature), supposing the temperature 
difference between the inhaled and exhaled air is calculated as 16˚C, the breath-
ing energy loss of the human body is about 1386 calorie/h. 
If we can breathe 36 ~ 37 degrees of air, almost the same as body’s tempera-
ture, which means that we will greatly reduce the burden of heat exchange of 
respiratory organs and save energy consumption of the body. The new ventila-
tor’s design concept is to add a gas relatively thermostatic heater (36˚C ~ 37˚C), 
a pulse gas heater and a pulse micro-ozoner in the breathing tube of the ordinary 
ventilator, as shown in Figure 1. This new type of ventilator [4] will supply the 
thermostatic (36˚C - 37˚C) oxygen and air, the pulse heated oxygen and air, as

well as the pulse micro-ozone. The breathing energy heating loss can be saved 
with using the thermostatic heater. By using the pulse heater, the temperature of 
the pulse inhaled gases can be instantly raised to 60˚C - 80˚C, such pulse thermal 
gases entering the lung can kill the virus quickly. Furthermore, the pulsed mi-
cro-ozone added by the bypass should have a better therapeutic effect of killing 
coronavirus in the lungs. Why do we use pulse mode, because it is safer and 
more comfortable for human body. 
2.2. New Treatment Cabin Plan 
The non-drug comprehensive treatment methods are composed of far-infrared 
heating therapy, oxygen therapy [5], hydrogen therapy [6], and ozone therapy. 
These treatment units form a complex treatment cabin [7] system, as shown in 
Figure  2.  The  treatment  cabin  has  a  chamber  that  contains  a  tempera-
ture-controllable far-infrared heater, an air inlets, an exhausts port, a bluetooth 
microphone, and the human body monitoring sensors, etc. This chamber is set 
at a sauna-like temperature of 50˚C ~ 70˚C. Such temperature is the typical 
temperature of sauna-room, so this kind of temperature gas is safe for human 
body, but, it is deadly for the virus. 
With this treatment chamber, the patient can be in a sitting position or 
on-the-fly therapy. Different comprehensive treatment methods can be adopted 
according to the patient’s symptoms. For example, when the far-infrared ther-
motherapy is being used, oxygen, air and micro ozone can also be introduced 
into the thermal cabin chamber. In addition, hydrogen therapy can be used al-
ternately to achieve better therapeutic effect on killing virus probably. 
Why does this cabin chamber have therapeutic effect? This is based on the 
previous trial judgment. Experiments have proved that the far infrared heater 
can effectively enhance the body’s temperature, cure the flu and expel the virus 
by sweating [8]. The thermal effect of far infrared can promote the speed of blood 
flow, which means that the white cells in the blood will move more quickly to 
detect and kill the virus. In addition, elevated body temperature will accelerate the

microcirculation and basal metabolism [9], enhance immunity [10] [11]. 
2.3. Cold Plasma Physical Treatment Plan 
Low temperature cold plasmas have been widely used to sterilize and kill viruses 
and germs [12] [13] [14], treating diseases caused by various infections [15] [16] 
[17], because it contains a huge number of energetic particles including elec-
trons, ions, free radicals, ozone, etc.. Based on the previous researches and a sin-
gle dielectric barrier electrode plasma generator [18],we have designed a nostril 
 
plasma sterilizer [19] which can be easily inserted into the nostril, as shown in 
Figure 3. A micro-discharge plasma can be produced in the casing gap on the 
side of the ground electrode wall of the shell, as shown in Figure 3 (right). Such 
a plasma is an air micro-discharge that can produce micro-ozone in the nostril, 
and its intensity can be modified by controlling a small power supply driven by 
rechargeable battery. It can be easily attached to clothes. Especially, this plasma 
sterilizer is safe for the human body with a very small power supply of less than 
1 watt. 
By easily wearing such a nostril sterilizer, the patient with mild symptoms 
may inhale some micro-ozone regularly and quantitatively each day to kill the 
viruses in the nasal cavity, respiratory tract, and lungs. For normal person, you 
also can reuse and ware it to replace the mask in high-risk infection room with 
dense crowds. 
3. Conclusions 
Three kinds of non-drug treatment plans are proposed in this paper, including: 
1) A new ventilator, which adopts the following improvements: a. Heating the 
temperature of the inhaled gas to the body’s temperature to reduce the burden of 
pulmonary thermal exchange and save the body energy consumption; b. Using a 
pulse inhaled gas to kill the virus, c. Using the inhaled micro-ozone to kill the vi-
rus. 2) A treatment chamber, which combines the far-infrared thermotherapy, 
thermal oxygen therapy, thermal air therapy and thermal micro-ozone to improve

the microcirculation, the basic metabolism and the immunity, further to make 
the  body  sweat  to  eliminate  the  virus.  3)  The  pulse  plasma  physical  mi-
cro-discharge tubes, which can be worn easily, to kill the virus in the nasal cavity 
and then use the inhaled ozone produced by the plasma to kill the virus. 
Although the above treatment methods and instruments are still in the early 
stage, they provide new plans and means for defeating the world epidemic. We 
are trying to speed up the improvement of these treatment products and start 
the clinical verification as soon as possible, so as to help the people suffering 
from the virus to get rid of the pain as soon as possible. 
In this emergency period,  especially considering the shortage of medical 
equipment and supplies all over the world, as a temporary emergency method, 
the authors recommend that the mild patient uses a sauna room with the tem-
perature from 50˚C to 70˚C to fight against the virus.
