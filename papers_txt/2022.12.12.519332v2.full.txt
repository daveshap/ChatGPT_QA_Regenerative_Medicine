ABSTRACT  
Aberrant expression of stem-cell-associated genes is a common feature in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and is linked to leukemic self-renewal and therapy resistance. Using 
AF10-rearranged leukemia as a prototypical example displaying a recurrent “stemness” 
network activated in AML, we screened for chromatin regulators that sustain aberrant 
activation of these networks. We deployed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen with a bespoke 
domain-focused library and identified several novel chromatin-modifying complexes as 
regulators of the TALE domain transcription factor MEIS1, a key leukemia stem cell 
(LSC)-associated gene. CRISPR droplet sequencing revealed that many of these MEIS1 
regulators  coordinately  controlled  the  transcription  of  several  AML  oncogenes.  In 
particular, we identified a novel role for the Tudor-domain containing chromatin reader 
protein SGF29 in the transcription of key AML oncogenes. Furthermore, SGF29 deletion 
impaired leukemogenesis in models representative of multiple AML subtypes. Our studies 
reveal a novel role for SGF29 as a non-oncogenic dependency in AML and identify the 
SGF29 Tudor domain as an attractive target for drug discovery.

MAIN  
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a devastating form of blood cancer with a dismal 
survival rate 1. Current therapies are often associated with strong toxicity and undesirable 
side effects, highlighting the need for safer, more effective alternatives. A major challenge 
in the development of new drugs for AML is the heterogeneity of the disease at the 
molecular level 2. AML is composed of several morphologic and molecular subtypes, with 
distinct mutational profiles and clinical characteristics 2. However, there are molecular 
pathways that are commonly dysregulated across different AML subtypes. Studies have 
shown that a variety of upstream genetic alterations in AML, including mutations in 
DNMT3  or  nucleophosmin  1  (NPM1),  and  fusion  products  of  several  different 
chromosomal translocations result in the activation of the clustered homeobox (HOX) 
genes and their co-factors such as the three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeobox 
gene MEIS1 (reviewed in (1–4)). Specific HOX genes such as the HOXA and/or HOXB 
genes as well as MEIS1 display significantly higher expression in a large proportion of 
AML samples compared to normal bone marrow cells 3–6. In particular, highly elevated 
expression of posterior HOXA or B genes and MEIS1 can be observed in as many as 
two-thirds of AML with diverse mutational profiles 7. Studies conducted using both loss-
of-function as well as gain-of-function approaches have demonstrated the importance of 
HOX/MEIS expression in leukemia pathogenesis in diverse subsets of AML including 
those bearing MLL-fusions (5,6), NUP98-fusions 8, and AF10-fusions 9,10, to name a few. 
Importantly, ectopic HOXA9 overexpression in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells (HSPCs) causes a myeloproliferative phenotype in mice that can progress to AML 
upon  MEIS1-co-expression11,12.  MEIS1 is  a  critical  co-factor of  leukemia-associated 
HOXA transcription factors and is required for their full leukemogenic capability 11,12. 
MEIS1 has also been shown to act as a rate-limiting regulator of leukemia stem cell (LSC) 
activity13.  Taken  together,  there  is  compelling  evidence  implicating  the  HOX/MEIS 
oncoproteins as a key node integrating a variety of functionally distinct oncogenic insults 
in AML.  
Thus, there is compelling preclinical evidence that pharmacological targeting of the 
HOX/MEIS pathway may yield therapeutic benefit in multiple, genetically heterogeneous 
AML sub-types. Since the HOX/MEIS proteins are DNA-binding transcription factors, they

have proven difficult to target directly using traditional drug-development methods. We 
reasoned that a detailed and systematic identification of epigenetic modulators critical for 
sustaining HOX/MEIS-activation in AML would help identify novel nodes for targeted 
drug-discovery campaigns aimed at this clinically important pathway. To this end, we 
conducted pharmacological and CRISPR-based genetic screens using enhanced green 
fluorescence protein (eGFP) tagged MEIS1 AML cells 14. Our screens identified several 
novel regulators of HOX/MEIS expression in AML and many of them were important for 
sustaining the expression of an array of leukemia oncogenes that drive AML including 
BMI1, SATB1 and MYC. Most notably, our studies identified a novel role for the Tudor 
domain-containing chromatin reader  protein SGF29 in AML. Our studies show that 
SGF29,  through  its  Tudor-domain-  is  a  critical  epigenetic  regulator  required  for 
maintaining transcription of key leukemia oncogenes and leukemogenesis of diverse AML 
subtypes.    
 
RESULTS 
A high-density, domain-focused CRISPR screen identifies epigenetic regulators of 
MEIS1 expression  
AML with the t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation - which results in the CALM-AF10 fusion 
gene - display highly elevated expression of several stem cell-associated factors including 
the HOXA cluster genes, MEIS1 and BMI1 15,16. Indeed, AML cell lines with CALM-AF10 
fusions display some of the highest expression of these oncogenes (Supplementary Fig. 
S1A). We used a CALM-AF10 positive AML cell line – U937 - where the enhanced green 
fluorescence protein (eGFP) is knocked into the endogenous MEIS1 locus immediately 
upstream of the start codon14. Leveraging this system, we sought to comprehensively 
identify  epigenetic  regulators  of  MEIS1  expression  as  a  surrogate  for  identifying 
HOX/MEIS regulators. First, we validated these U937-eGFP-MEIS1 cells (henceforth 
termed UB3) by perturbation with sgRNAs targeting DOT1L (Fig. 1A). Using these cells, 
we conducted a chemical compound screen using high-throughput flow-cytometry in a 
384 well format assaying for eGFP levels (see Supplementary Fig. S1C for schematic).

(Supplementary  Table  S1)  revealed  inhibitors  of  DOT1L  and  ENL,  targets  already 
established to regulate HOX/MEIS expression in AML 17–19 as “hits” - defined by >50% 
drop in eGFP-MEIS1 expression (Fig. 1B). Highly similar results were obtained in mouse 
MLL-AF9 transformed myeloid cells that we established from the bone marrow (BM) of a 
recently reported eGFP-MEIS1 transgenic mouse (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Since no 
novel MEIS1 regulators were identified in our small-molecule screens, we reasoned that 
this was likely due to limitations of the small-molecule library composition. Most families 
of poorly studied epigenetic readers, writers and eraser proteins are not represented in 
currently available chemical epigenetic inhibitor libraries, precluding the identification of 
their activities in phenotypic screens. Therefore, we sought to extend our investigation of 
MEIS1 epigenetic regulators using a genetic screening approach. Towards this end, we 
developed a high-density CRISPR library targeting 645 epigenetic regulators including 
chromatin readers, writers of histone acetylation, methylation and other modifications, 
genes involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription elongation,  and DNA & RNA 
modifications in addition to control genes and non-targeting sgRNA controls (Fig. 1C and 
Supplementary Table S2). Studies have shown that targeting exons encoding functional 
domains  may  generate  a  higher  proportion  of  null  mutations  and  result  in  greater 
phenotypic selection compared to sgRNAs targeting early constitutive exons20. Thus, we 
extracted the coding sequence corresponding to annotated protein domains available in 
Uniprot, for all our epigenetic CRISPR library genes (see Supplementary Methods). Then, 
we designed sgRNAs for the domain-encoding sequences on the Broad Institute Genetic 
Perturbation  (GPP)  Platform  CRISPRko  tool21.  We  incorporated  the  5  top-scoring 
sgRNAs of each annotated domain of every gene (see Methods). In addition to domain-
focused sgRNAs, we designed 5 sgRNAs based on the standard early exon-targeting 
criterion. We used the epigenetics CRISPR library to conduct an in vitro phenotypic 
enrichment  screen  in  single-cloned  lentiviral  Cas9-expressing  UB3  cells.  We 
hypothesized that enrichments in low- or high- eGFP fractions would help identify MEIS1 
positive or negative regulators, respectively. Thus, we sorted the top 25% and bottom 
25% fractions based on eGFP levels using flow cytometry (FACS, see Fig. 1D for 
schematic). Normalized read counts of non-targeting controls and polymerase-encoding 
genes  were  uniformly  distributed  in  both  high-  and  low-  eGFP  fractions,  indicating

successful technical performance of controls (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Our analyses of 
the screen with the MAGeCKFlute pipeline (22,23) revealed several novel regulators, 
including AFF2, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B, SGF29/CCDC101, ENY2, TAF6, HDAC1, and 
LDB1, as well as most of the previously described epigenetic regulators of MEIS1 or HOX 
gene expression in AML, such as DOT1L (24–26), MLLT1/ENL (18,19), MLLT10/AF10 
(24,27), KAT7/HBO1(28,29), JADE3 (28) and KMT2A/MLL1 (Fig. 1E).  Analysis of the top 
candidate hits using the STRING database (17) showed that multiple proteins from six 
chromatin complexes were identified (Fig. 1F). This reinforced the possibility that we 
identified distinct constituents of chromatin-modifying complexes with MEIS1 regulatory 
activity – offering independent, complementary nodes for therapeutic targeting.  
 
Competition assays reveal the role of MEIS1 regulators in AML cell growth 
Next, we sought to test the requirement of our top candidate MEIS1 regulators for AML 
cell growth. For this, we conducted arrayed CRISPR competition assays, first in UB3 cells 
(see Fig. 2A for schematic). Specifically, we cloned 2-3 sgRNAs for each of the top 
candidate hits (SGF29, ENY2, AFF2, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B, MLLT1, KAT7, and JADE3), 
in addition to DOT1L as a positive control, and non-targeting controls (NTC). For this, we 
used a plasmid vector co-expressing a blue fluorescence protein (BFP) and lentivirally 
transduced U937 cells at a ~50% transduction rate. We then sampled the populations by 
flow  cytometry  for  up  to  14  days  and  observed  a  significant  (P<0.05,  n  =3)  and 
progressive decline in the percentage of BFP-positive cells targeted by all the candidate 
hits compared to NTCs over time (Fig. 2B).  In addition, we observed a significant drop in 
eGFP  fluorescence  (P<0.05,  n=3),  for  multiple  sgRNAs  targeting  candidate  hits, 
confirming a strong reduction in MEIS1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In sum, 
these results indicate our phenotypic screening strategy uncovered high-confidence 
MEIS1 regulators that affect the growth of U937 cells. In order to rule out that this anti-
proliferative effect was limited to the CALM-AF10 positive cell line U937, we tested some 
of the novel MEIS1 regulators, including CSNK2A1, ENY2, and SGF29 and controls in a 
Cas9-expressing MLL-AF9 fusion-positive MOLM13 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S2C). 
CRISPR deletion of these genes also led to a progressive decline in the percentage of

BFP-positive cells compared to NTC-transduced cells, indicating that growth of MOLM13 
cells also depended on these genes (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Interestingly, among 
these genes, the deletion of SGF29 and ENY2 had the most detrimental effects on the 
growth of both U937 as well as MOLM13-cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2C). 
 
CRISPR  droplet-sequencing  reveals  candidate  hits  regulate  leukemia 
oncotranscriptome  
Since we used MEIS1 as a surrogate reporter for the screen, we wanted to further 
evaluate the following: a) whether our candidate hits could regulate the expression not 
only of MEIS1, but also of other AML-associated oncogenes including the HOXA cluster 
genes, and b) which epigenetic regulators from our hits had the most pronounced effects 
on  sustaining  transcription  of  AML-promoting  oncogenes.  For  this,  we generated  a 
targeted, small pooled CRISPR library containing 2-3 validated sgRNAs per candidate 
gene together with NTCs (a total of 29 sgRNAs) and performed a single cell RNA-
sequencing experiment in the UB3 cell line. In our pool, we also included sgRNAs for 
control genes which are either chromatin readers that do not show HOX/MEIS-specific 
gene  regulatory  activity  in  U937  cells  (MLLT3,  MLLT6),  or  have  non-selective 
transcriptional effects (BRD4). With these sgRNAs, we used CRISPR droplet sequencing 
(CROP-Seq) 22, which allows for matching the single-cell RNA-sequencing profile of each 
cell to the sgRNA expressed within it, and thus infer knockout signatures of each of the 
CRISPR-deleted genes. After sgRNA assignment, we performed unbiased clustering of 
whole transcriptome single-cell RNA-seq data using the Ward.D2 minimum variance 
method  (see  Supplemental  Methods)  revealing  the  relatedness  of  each  of  the 
perturbations  (Supplementary  Figs.  S2D  and  S2E).  While  the  transcriptomes  of 
CSNK2A1-, KMT2A- and MLLT10- knockout cells clustered together, DOT1L-, MLLT1-, 
AFF2-  and  SGF29-  deleted  transcriptomes  formed  a  distinct  cluster,  indicating 
transcriptional similarities. We then also performed clustering on the basis of HOX/MEIS 
expression  to  investigate  transcriptional  relatedness  (Supplementary  Fig.  S2F,  see 
Supplemental Methods). Our analysis identified 3 major clusters. One cluster comprises 
DOT1L, MLLT1, MLLT10, and AFF2. This possibly reflects the overlapping activities or

proteins  that  have  been  described  to  interact  in  multi-protein  complexes  23–25. 
Interestingly,  in  our  studies,  AFF2,  but  not  the  super-elongation  (SEC)  complex 
constituent AFF4 was identified as a regulator of HOX/MEIS expression in U937 cells 
(Fig. 1E, Fig. S2F, and Supplementary Table S3). 
Similarly, the deletion of MLLT1, but not its homolog MLLT3, modulated HOX/MEIS 
expression in the UB3 cells, consistent with a prior study in a KMT2A-rearranged AML 
(8). Another cluster consisted of the genes KAT7, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B, and SGF29, 
whose deletion also had potent effects on the downregulation of  MEIS1 and other 
leukemia oncogenes, such as HOXA cluster, BMI1, SATB1, RNF220, and MSI2 (Fig. 2C, 
Fig.  S2F,  and  Supplementary  Table  S3).  Moreover,  their  deletion  also  led  to  a 
concomitant increase in the expression of myeloid differentiation-associated genes such 
as lysozyme (LYZ), ELANE, the cathepsins CTSA and CTSD, and S100A8/A9 (Fig. 2D 
and Supplementary Fig. S2H). Cluster 3 consisted of the control genes we included in 
our CROP-Seq study, namely AFF4 and the chromatin readers BRD4 and MLLT3, whose 
deletion  had  no  significant  effects  on  HOX/MEIS  or  on  differentiation-associated 
signatures in the setting of the UB3 cell line. Taken together, our studies showed that 
several epigenetic regulators identified in our eGFP-MEIS1 screen were important for 
sustaining key LSC signature genes and limiting the gene expression characteristic of a 
differentiation block in U937 cells. 
 
CRISPR assays earmark SGF29 as an AML-selective dependency 
One of the challenges in developing epigenetic candidates as therapeutic targets is their 
potential for non-selective toxicity. One way of testing the selectivity of a candidate gene 
is  to  investigate  the  effect  of  its  genetic  deletion  in  the  cancer  dependency  maps 
(DepMap) dataset, a database of genome-scale functional genetic screens across cancer 
cell lines 26. We evaluated the efficacy (the degree to which CRISPR knockout of the 
candidate gene reduces cell fitness in sensitive lines), and selectivity (the degree of 
differences in its essentiality across all cancer cell lines) of our top candidates using 
CRISPR and shRNA data available in Shiny DepMap 27. Our analyses showed that 
depletion  of  some  of  our  hits,  including  SGF29,  ENY2  and  CSNK2A1,  as  well  as

previously characterized genes such as DOT1L, MLLT1, MLLT10 and KAT7 had a higher 
selectivity  compared  to  pan-essential  genes,  such  as  PSMA4  or  the  broader 
transcriptional regulator BRD4 (Fig. S2I), indicating that these targets may have a better 
therapeutic index. Next, we assessed the lineage specificity of depleting our candidates 
in  AML,  by  comparing  the  differences  in  median  CRISPR  knockout  fitness  scores 
(Chronos) between 26 AML cell lines and 1,060 non-AML cancer cell lines. This analysis 
showed that while depletion of some of the hits was highly AML-selective, that of others 
was not. Specifically, the most AML-selective genes were MLLT1, SGF29, DOT1L, AFF2, 
and KMT2A (ranked in decreasing order of AML selectivity as assessed by a Wilcox test 
of AML vs non-AML Chronos scores, Fig. 2F).  Other chromatin regulators, namely 
MLLT10, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B, JADE3, and ENY2 were not AML selective (with an FDR 
p-value cutoff <0.05). Of particular interest to us was the chromatin reader SGF29, in 
terms  of  its  strong  effect  on  leukemogenic  gene  expression  programs,  high  AML 
selectivity across 1,086 cancer cell types (Fig. 2E and 2F) and hitherto uncharacterized 
role in leukemia.  
 
SGF29 deletion has marked anti-leukemia effects in cell line- and patient-derived 
AML models 
Since our transcriptomic, arrayed CRISPR validation and computational studies showed 
that SGF29 was one of the strongest dependencies from our hits across AML cell lines, 
we sought to directly assess the impact of its deletion on human AML cell growth and 
leukemogenesis. Consistent with our flow cytometry-based in vitro competition assays 
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2C), we observed that SGF29 inactivation using 
validated  CRISPR  sgRNAs  (Supplementary  Fig.  S3A)  led  to  significantly  increased 
retention of the Cell Trace Violet dye (see Methods) in both U937, as well as MOLM13 
AML cell lines, indicating diminished proliferation compared to cells treated with NTCs 
(Figs. 3A and 3B). Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects of SGF29 deletion were 
accompanied by a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 fraction 
compared to SGF29 wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Importantly, SGF29-
deleted cells showed increased uptake of fluorescence-labeled heat-inactivated E. coli

bioparticles, indicative of functional myeloid differentiation of U937 cells (Fig. 3C and 3D). 
Next, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of MOLM13 and U937 cells with 
SGF29 CRISPR knockout compared to NTC cells. Our RNA-seq analysis showed that 
SGF29 deletion significantly decreased the expression of several HOXA cluster genes in 
addition to MEIS1 in both cell lines (Figs. 3E & 3G), confirming its role in HOX/MEIS 
regulation in diverse AML subtypes. Further, there was a significant reduction in the 
expression of other oncogenes such as MYC (Fig. S3C). The expression of MYC target 
genes was highly enriched in NTC cells, compared to the SGF29-deleted counterparts, 
as assessed using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA28, Fig. S3D). We then tested the 
effects of SGF29 deletion  on in vivo leukemogenesis using cell line-derived (CDX) 
xenograft  models  in  NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1Mom Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ  (NRG)  mice.  In  these 
experiments, we observed a significant increase in disease latency upon SGF29 knockout 
in Cas9-expressing U937 and MOLM13 cell lines (Figs. 3F & 3H).  
 
Genetic Sgf29 inactivation impairs the clonogenicity of transformed but not normal 
hematopoietic progenitors 
Next, given the role of SGF29 in the transcription of self-renewal-associated genes, we 
wanted to test the effect of Sgf29 inactivation on the clonogenic capability of myeloid bone 
marrow  (BM)  cells  transformed  by  distinct  AML  driver  oncoproteins.  We  therefore 
performed methylcellulose-based colony forming unit (CFU) assays on murine bone 
marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transformed using the CALM-
AF10, MLL-AF10 or MLL-AF9 fusions. We observed a significant reduction in the number 
of colonies with a blast-like morphology in CALM-AF10 transformed cells upon Sgf29 
deletion using exon-targeting sgRNAs (Fig. S4A), compared to Sgf29 intron-targeting 
controls (Figs. 4A-C). Interestingly, while there was a dramatic decrease in the number 
of immature blast-like colonies, there were modest effects on the number of differentiated 
colonies. Thus, most colonies in the Sgf29-/- arm bore a differentiated morphology (Fig. 
4B). The strong reduction in blast colony formation persisted for at least two rounds of 
replating (Supplementary Fig. S4B). At the cellular level, in contrast to the immature, 
myeloid blast-like cellular morphology observed in Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins of

cells with wild-type Sgf29, the Sgf29 knockout cells resembled terminally differentiated, 
or differentiating myeloid lineage cells (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained from BM 
cells  transformed  using  MLL-AF9  (Fig.  4D-F)  and  MLL-AF10  (Fig.  4G-I)  fusion 
oncoproteins. Sgf29 deleted cells also showed increased apoptosis compared to wild-
type cells as measured by immunoblotting for cleaved PARP (Supplementary Fig. S4E).  
Next, tested the effect of Sgf29 deletion on the colony-forming ability of normal HSPCs. 
In contrast to BM cells transformed using AML oncoproteins, CRISPR-mediated Sgf29 
deletion  in  murine lineage  negative,  Sca-1  positive,  Kit-positive  (LSK)  cells  did  not 
discernably alter either the number or type of colonies observed in CFU assays (Fig. 4J-
K).  Taken  together,  these  data  indicate  that  Sgf29  inactivation  influences  the 
clonogenicity and differentiation of cells transformed by diverse AML oncoproteins, but 
not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). 
 
The Tudor domain of SGF29 is essential for its role in myeloid transformation  
The SGF29 protein harbors a carboxy (C)-terminal tandem Tudor domain, which is 
important  for  the  recognition  of  H3K4  di/trimethylated  chromatin  modifications  and 
recruitment of KAT2A (GCN5)-containing chromatin-modifying complexes29–31. In our 
epigenetic CRISPR library screen, we identified that top-performing sgRNAs for SGF29 
mapped to its Tudor domain. Thus, we hypothesized that this domain may be required 
for the transcriptional activation of AML oncogenes including the HOX/MEIS genes, BMI1 
and MYC. To assess the dependency of the Tudor domain for SGF29 localization in the 
HOX/MEIS loci, we cloned a Flag-tagged SGF29 gene and generated a stably transduced 
U937 cell line. Similarly, in order to test the effect of the SGF29 Tudor domain we also 
generated U937 cells expressing the SGF29D196R mutant, which has been shown to 
disrupt H3K4me3 binding using in vitro peptide binding assays 29. ChIP-sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) using a Flag antibody in the Flag-SGF29 U937 cells showed that the protein-
occupied regions that were enriched for H3K4me3 marked active promoters and H3K27 
acetylated enhancers (Figs. 5A&B). SGF29 occupied the promoter and/or enhancer 
regions of HOX/MEIS genes as well as other AML oncogenes whose expression was 
dependent on SGF29 (including BMI1 and MYC, Fig. 5C). Interestingly, in contrast to the

wildtype  SGF29,  binding  of  the  SGF29D196R mutant  to  these  gene  loci  was  almost 
obliterated (Fig. 5C). Next, we tested whether the Tudor domain is important for the 
clonogenicity of leukemia cells using the CFU assay. Using the MLL-AF9 murine model 
in which we observe a highly significant decrease in the formation of immature blast-like 
colonies upon endogenous Sgf29 deletion,  we retrovirally overexpressed wildtype human 
SGF29  (impervious  to  the  mouse  anti-Sgf29  sgRNAs)  or  the  SGF29D196R mutant 
counterpart. CFU assays demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of wildtype, but not 
mutant SGF29, could completely rescue the loss of blast-like CFUs upon endogenous 
Sgf29 deletion (Fig. 5D). Notably, ectopic expression of the SGF29D196R mutant itself 
dramatically reduced the number of blast-like colonies even in MLL-AF9 cells with intact 
endogenous Sgf29 alleles, indicating that the SGF29D196R mutant has dominant negative 
activity (Fig. 5D).  
 
SGF29 regulates chromatin localization of proteins with established roles in AML 
pathogenesis 
We sought to identify the molecular mechanism by which SGF29 elicits its effects on the 
transcription of leukemia oncogenes. SGF29 participates in distinct chromatin regulatory 
complexes,  including  the  ADA2A-containing  (ATAC)  complex  and  the  SPT3-TAF9-
GCN5-acetyltransferase complex (STAGA) complex, the mammalian homolog of the 
yeast SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5-acetyltransferase complex). Both of these complexes 
harbor  the  KAT2A  (GCN5)  and  KAT2B  (PCAF)  acetyltransferases  with  histone 
acetylating activity and prominent roles in transcriptional activation32.  Thus, we sought to 
investigate which epigenetic regulators are evicted from chromatin upon SGF29 depletion 
in AML cells. For this, we performed chromatin enrichment proteomics (ChEP)33 (see Fig. 
6A for schematic). This recently developed method allows an unbiased quantitative and 
qualitative assessment of the chromatin-associated proteome33. Our ChEP purification 
yielded  substantial  enrichment  of  the  chromatin  fraction  as  measured  by  the  high 
proportional abundance of histones, histone modifying proteins, transcription factors, and 
other chromatin and nuclear-associated proteins in the enriched fractions (Fig. 6B and 
Supplementary Fig. S5A). SGF29 deletion in U937 cells significantly decreased the

abundance  of  key  AML  oncoproteins,  as  measured  by  the  intensity  of  chromatin-
associated peptides by mass spectrometry.  Specifically, the levels of HOXA13 and 
SATB1 were significantly reduced in the chromatin fraction of SGF29-deleted cells in 
contrast to their wild-type counterparts. Of note, the levels of MEIS1 and MYC were 
undetectable in the chromatin fraction of SGF29 deleted cells in contrast to their SGF29 
wild-type counterparts, where these proteins were highly abundant (Figs. 6C-D and 
Supplementary Fig. S5B). We also observed a significant decrease in the abundance of 
CDK4 and CDK6 proteins, involved in cell cycle regulation and known to play prominent 
roles in the proliferation of cancer cells, particularly in AML34. Most importantly, our ChEP 
analysis demonstrated that SGF29 deletion led to a significant decrease in the chromatin 
abundance of key components of the SAGA complex, the histone acetyltransferase 
KAT2A, as well as the transcriptional adaptor protein TADA3 (Fig. 6C and Supplementary 
Fig. S5B). These results indicate that SGF29 deletion may lead to the eviction of the 
SAGA complex from the chromatin fraction of U937 cells. We confirmed our results by 
immunoblotting using a KAT2A-specific antibody in different cellular fractions in the 
SGF29 wildtype or CRISPR-deleted AML cells. Our studies demonstrated that while 
KAT2A could be found mostly in the chromatin fraction in wildtype U937 cells, SGF29 
deletion indeed led to an increased abundance of KAT2A in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 
6E).  
 
SGF29 deletion diminishes H3K9Ac on the promoters of key leukemia oncogenes  
Our  results  showing  that  SGF29  deletion  decreased  the  abundance of  the  histone 
acetyltransferase KAT2A in the chromatin fraction led us to hypothesize that SGF29 
recruits  the  chromatin  activity  of  KAT2A  on  AML  oncogene  loci.  KAT2A  is  the 
acetyltransferase subunit of the SAGA complex that plays important roles in leukemia and 
other cancers 35. We performed ChIP-seq for H3K9Ac, the major histone modification 
deposited by the SAGA complex, which is associated with transcriptional activation 32. 
Our  analysis  of  the  ChIP-seq  data  showed  that  upon  SGF29  deletion,  there  were 
significant changes in H3K9Ac, with 10,834 peaks showing reduced acetylation and 3,119 
peaks showing increased acetylation in SGF29 knockout compared to wildtype U937 cells

(Fig. 7A, and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Importantly, there was a pronounced decrease 
in  acetylation  levels  at  the  promoter  of  several  AML  oncogenes  that  were  also 
transcriptionally downregulated in the SGF29 knockout RNA-seq data. This included 
HOXA cluster genes, MYC, BMI1, and SATB1 – all bona fide AML oncogenes with 
established roles in augmenting leukemic self-renewal (Fig. 7B).   
 
SGF29 deletion impairs in vitro and in vivo leukemogenesis in a patient-derived 
xenograft model of AML 
We then wanted to assess the effect of SGF29 deletion in a human AML patient sample. 
For this, we used AML393 cells, a patient-derived xenograft expressing split-Cas936. In 
these cells, SGF29 knockout using a BFP-co-expressing sgRNA led to a strong reduction 
in  proliferative  advantage  in  a  competition  assay  compared  to  non-SGF29-sgRNA 
expressing cells (Fig. 7C).  Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of SGF29-knockout 
compared to NTC transduced AML393 cells showed a significant reduction of HOXA9 
and MEIS1 transcripts (Fig. 7D). We then injected the AML393 cells with SGF29 or NTC  
sgRNAs  into  NSG  mice and  monitored engraftment  of  human  Cas9-GFP+  cells in 
peripheral blood by flow cytometry (data not shown). In comparison to the AML CDX 
models described in Fig. 3F&H, we observed more pronounced effects of SGF29 deletion 
in this human PDX model of AML. Whereas mice injected with NTC-targeting sgRNAs 
succumbed to AML with a median latency of 64 days, those injected with sgRNAs 
targeting SGF29 showed a median disease latency of 165 days post-injection (Fig. 
7E).  Taken together, our results demonstrate that SGF29 is important for sustaining 
critical  transcriptional  networks  in  leukemogenesis  and  may  serve  as  an  attractive 
therapeutic target in AML.  
  
DISCUSSION 
 
In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that the expression of cancer-
promoting  oncogenes  is  sustained  by  specific  chromatin  modulators  that  are  often

essential and/or rate-limiting for oncogenesis. Thus, these epigenetic regulators may act 
as  non-oncogene  dependencies  presenting  attractive  new  therapeutic  targets  in 
cancer6,37–40.  The  chromatin  reader  protein  SGF29  was  discovered  in  yeast  as  a 
component of the SAGA (Spt–Ada–Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex 48 and is highly 
conserved across several species (reviewed in 49,50). SGF29 was shown to contain two 
tandem Tudor domains at the C-terminus, which specifically bind di- and tri- methylated 
H3K4  residues  29,30.    In  mammalian  cells,  SGF29  is  a  key  component  of  diverse 
chromatin-modifying complexes with overlapping subunits. The Ada two-A-containing 
(ATAC) and the SAGA complexes are the most well-characterized and have distinct 
chromatin targets 29. As part of the enzymatic HAT module in SAGA (along with Gcn5, 
Ada3, and Ada2), SGF29 allows the complex to dock to pre-existing trimethyl marks at 
promoters and stimulates subsequent processive acetylation51. The SAGA complex is 
responsible for H3K9 acetylation, a modification that fine-tunes, rather than initiates, 
locus-specific transcriptional activity52. SAGA integrates multiple coactivator functions, 
but there are distinct genetic requirements for each module during gene regulation 47. 
Data  from  studies  in  murine  MLL-AF9  leukemia  suggest  that  ATAC  is  a  generic 
requirement  in  cancer,  whereas  SAGA  is  selectively  important  in  AML35.  In 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sgf29 is required for SAGA promoter recruitment and H3K9 
acetylation in vivo 29 and our results show that this is also true in AML cells where the 
localization of human KAT2A is controlled by SGF29. This indicates that SGF29 may be 
rate-limiting for the oncogenic activities of SAGA in AML 47 and perhaps in other cancers 
where KAT2A activity is implicated in oncogenesis48,49. 
 
Interestingly,  our  results  also  show  that  SGF29  is  an  important  regulator  of  the 
transcription  as  well  as  chromatin  abundance  of  several  leukemia-associated 
transcription  factors  in  AML  cells  and  plays  an  important  role  in  sustaining  the 
leukemogenesis of diverse AML oncoproteins. Our results indicate that SGF29 may 
regulate the differentiation block in AML, as its deletion promoted the expression of 
several differentiation-associated genes in both U937 and MOLM13 cells, enhanced 
phagocytic uptake, and led to a significant increase in the formation of colonies with a 
differentiated morphology from murine AMLs harboring distinct driver gene-fusions. One

of the genes highly downregulated by SGF29 loss in AML was MYC, in agreement with 
observations in human hepatocellular carcinoma50.  SGF29 has also recently been 
identified  as  a  negative  regulator  of  anti-tumor  immunity  in  a  mouse  model  of 
adenocarcinoma51, indicating that the protein may have cell-intrinsic as well as non-
intrinsic tumor-promoting activities.  
 
In this study, we demonstrate that a phenotypic pooled CRISPR screen based on the 
expression of MEIS1 revealed multiple constituents of 6 chromatin-modifying complexes 
as regulators of a gene-expression program linked to AML oncogenesis. Among our top 
hits, we encountered “writers” and “readers” known to function in concert. For example, 
our top hits include the MYST complex gene KAT7, an acetyltransferase (writer), and its 
plant  homeodomain  (PHD)-containing  acetylation  reader,  JADE3  (reader);  or  the 
methyltransferase DOT1L (writer) and AF10 or ENL (readers), or SGF29 (reader) and the 
acetyltransferase KAT2A (writer).  These results are interesting because they not only 
validate  the  robustness  of  the  screen  but  importantly,  point  to  separate  nodes  for 
therapeutic targeting of the same complex. Several chromatin writers such as DOT1L, 
KAT2A, and KAT7 are known to be targeted to different gene loci by separate chromatin 
readers. Therefore, targeting the chromatin reader required for the specific localization of 
leukemia-promoting chromatin writers to oncogene loci may arguably present a better 
safety profile in terms of therapeutic targeting compared to targeting the chromatin writers 
themselves.  The paradigm of inhibiting reader proteins began with the development of 
tool  compounds  targeting  bromodomains52,  which  spurred  translation  to  clinical 
candidates. Other efforts for reader targeting include PHD fingers, WD40 repeat domains, 
and Royal family methyl-lysine readers (MBT, chromodomain, Tudor domain, PWWP 
domain, and the YEATS domain 53–58. Royal family domains all share a structural aromatic 
cage that binds methyl-lysine side chains and for discrimination between lysine mono-, 
di-, and tri- methylation residues. These structural features comprise pockets of amenable 
size and hydrophobicity which may allow small-molecule binding.  Our work provides a 
rationale for inhibitors targeting the chromatin reading activity of the Tudor domain, which 
is required for the chromatin occupancy of SGF29-associated complexes, including 
SAGA, and transcriptional coactivation of oncogenic gene expression programs. We

intravenously  by  tail  vein  injections  into  NOD/SCID  mice  (Jackson  Laboratories, 
#005557). Mice were monitored every day and sacrificed when critically ill. For MLL-AF10 
PDX studies, 150,000 cells expressing split Cas9 and NTC or SGF29 sgRNA were 
injected into NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories, #013062) by tail vein injections. Mice were 
bled every 2 to 3 weeks for checking AML cell engraftment by flow cytometry. Blood was 
collected by retro-orbital bleeding and red blood cells were lysed using 1X PharmLyse 
Buffer (BD Biosciences), then washed with 1X PBS, and analyzed on the LSR Fortessa.  
Animals were sacrificed when critically ill.  
 
Cell culture  
Human leukemia cell lines U937 (kind gift from Dr. Daniel Tenen, Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center) and  MOLM13 (ACC-554, DSMZ), were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium 
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% Fetal bovine serum and 
50  U/ml  Penicillin/Streptomycin  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Carlsbad,  CA),  2  mM  L-
glutamine and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Murine leukemia cells were cultured in 
DMEM  medium  supplemented  with  2  mM  L-glutamine,  15%  FBS  and  50U/ml 
Penicillin/Streptomycin, in the presence of  the following cytokines: 10 ng/ml murine 
interleukin 6 (mIL-6), 6 ng/ml murine interleukin 3 (mIL3) and 20 ng/ml murine stem cell 
factor (mSCF) (all from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and incubated at 5% CO2 and 37°C. 
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine 
and sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS and 50 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, and incubated in 
5% CO2 at 37°C. MLL-AF10 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells were cultured in IMDM 
medium supplemented with 20% BIT9500 (STEMCELL Technologies), human cytokines, 
and StemRegenin 1 44 (SR1), and UM171 as described earlier59. 
 
CRISPR Screen data analysis 
Fastq files from the epigenetics CRISPR screen were analyzed using the MAGeCK-
VISPR MLE pipeline 60. Gene rankings were generated comparing the GFP -low and -
high  fractions  to  T0.  Both  experimental  conditions  were  further  compared  using

SUPPLEMENTARY  METHODS 
 
Epigenetic sgRNA library design 
Our custom sgRNA library was designed based on a manually curated list of known epigenetic 
regulators, assigned to the following categories: regulators of chromatin reading, chromatin 
remodeling, DNA and RNA modification, histone acetylation and methylation, transcriptional 
elongation and other histone modifications. The gene list was then used directly as the input for 
the Broad Institute Genetic Perturbation Platform (GPP) sgRNA designer tool 210–213 to obtain 5 
sgRNAs  targeting  early  constitutive  exons.  To  design  sgRNAs  targeting  functional  protein 
domains,  we  retrieved  the  coding  sequences  for  ENSEMBL-annotated  protein  domains 
(GRCh37) using a custom script (cds_domain_finder.py). Non-targeting control sgRNAs were 
included in the design and represented ~5% of the total library size. The library sequences were 
synthesized on an array platform (Genscript, NJ) and then cloned into the lenti-guide Puro vector 
(Addgene: #52963, a kind gift from Dr. Feng Zhang, MIT) with the Gibson Assembly kit (New 
England Biolabs, NJ). The library plasmid was amplified using ElectroMAX™ Stbl4™ Competent 
Cells (Invitrogen, cat.11635018). The number of bacterial colonies was kept >500 times the 
number  of  sgRNA  sequences  in  the  library  to  maintain  representation.  To  ensure  the 
representation  and  identity  of  sgRNAs  in  the  amplified  pooled  lentiviral  plasmids,  deep 
sequencing was performed on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina) and fastq files were analyzed using 
CRISPREssoCount 214. The sgRNA sequences in these libraries are deposited as indicated in the 
data availability section.  
 
Epigenetic CRISPR screen 
The pooled epigenetics CRISPR library virus was produced using HEK293T cells transfected with 
Polyethylimine (PEI), pMD2.G, and psPAX2 as previously described 215. 30 million UB3 cells were 
transduced with the pooled epigenetics library lentivirus in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 8 μg/ml polybrene. The medium was changed 24 h after 
transduction to remove polybrene and cells were plated in fresh culture medium. 48 h after 
transduction, puromycin was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml to select for cells transduced 
with the sgRNA library and then removed after 72 h. The virus titer was measured by infection of 
cells with serially diluted virus. To ensure transduction of a single sgRNA per cell, the multiplicity 
of infection (MOI) was set to 0.3 ~ 0.4. Adequate representation of sgRNAs during the screen 

NEW PAGE

was ensured by keeping >1000x cells in culture relative to the library size. 10 million cells per 
replicate were harvested 3 days after puromycin removal for an initial time point (T0). Cells were 
FACS-sorted 5 days later to collect the upper and lower quartiles on the basis of GFP-expression 
using  the  FACSAria  II  Instrument  (BD  Biosciences)  at  the  Sanford  Burnham  Prebys  Flow 
Cytometry Core. Genomic DNA extraction from the T0 and GFP -low and -high cells was 
performed  using  the  Zymo  QuickDNA™  Midiprep  Plus  Kit  (Zymo  Research,  Cat.  D4068), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A two-step PCR-amplification for sequencing library 
preparation was conducted with TaKaRa Ex Taq™ Polymerase (TaKara, Cat. RR001) and 
custom primers to achieve adequate sequencing coverage in 1x75bp single-end reads, following 
published guidelines 214. Barcoded libraries were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 
500.  
 
CRISPR competition experiments 
To assess the candidate hits in independent assays, two top ranked individual sgRNAs from the 
sgRNA library were cloned for CSNK2A1, JADE3, AFF2, CCDC101, CSNK2B, DOT1L, ENY2, 
KAT7,  KMT2A,  MLLT1,  and  for  non-targeting  controls  in  the  pKLV2-U6gRNA5(BbsI)-
PGKpuro2ABFP-W vector (a gift from Kosuke Yusa, Addgene plasmid # 67974) 218 (sgRNA 
sequences provided in Table 2).  Lentiviral supernatants were made from these constructs in a 
96-well arrayed format. 10,000 UB3 cells were plated in a retronectin (Takara, #T202) coated flat 
bottom  96-well  plate  and  transduced  with  the  sgRNA  viral  supernatants  by  spinfection  in 
polybrene-supplemented medium at an MOI of ~0.5. Cells were maintained in culture in 96-well 
plate format and assayed for proliferation every 3 days. A sample >10% of the culture volume 
was stained with SytoxRed (1:1000) (Thermo Fisher, # S34859) in PBS and monitored for the 
percentage of blue fluorescent protein (BFP) expressing cells progressively up to 21 days using 
high-throughput flow-cytometry 219. 
 
Cell culture  
Human leukemia cell lines U937 (Daniel Tenen, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and  
MOLM13 (ACC-554, DSMZ), were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine  and  sodium  pyruvate,  10%  Fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS  from…  and  50  U/ml 
Penicillin/Streptomycin  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Carlsbad,  CA),  2  mM  L-glutamine  and 
incubated  in  5%  CO2  at  37°C.  Murine  leukemia  cells  were  cultured  in  DMEM  medium 
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 15% FBS and 50U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, in the 

NEW PAGE

presence of following cytokines: 10 ng/ml murine interleukin 6 (mIL-6), 6 ng/ml murine interleukin 
3 (mIL3) and 20 ng/ml murine stem cell factor (mSCF) (all from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and 
incubated at 5% CO2 and 37°C. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented 
with 2 mM L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS and 50 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, and 
incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. MLL-AF10 patient derived xenograft (PDX) cells were cultured in 
IMDM medium supplemented with 20% BIT9500 ( STEMCELL Technologies), human cytokines 
and StemRegenin 1 44 (SR1) and UM171 as described earlier(11). 
 
 
Generation of murine reporter leukemia 
For  mouse  experiments,  inducible  MLL-AF9  murine  leukemias  were  generated  in  lineage-
depleted bone marrow cells of mice with a GFP-Meis1 (12) or CAG-Cas9 (13) background. 
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were isolated from bone marrow of C57Bl/6 
mice using EasySep lineage depletion (STEMCELL Technologies) kit. HSPCs were cultured over-
night in DMEM medium supplemented with 15% FBS and mSCF, mIL6 and mIL3 in a 37 °C 
incubator with 5% CO . The following day, the cells were transduced with viral supernatants 
2
containing the MSCV-MLL-AF9-neo and the MSCV-rTTA-2A-BFP constructs by spinfection at 
2500 rpm at 30°C for 90 min. 72 hr post-transduction, BFP+ve cells were sorted using the 
FACSAria II  (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer (11). In vitro transformed BFP+ cells were then 
injected into sub-lethally irradiated C57Bl/6 recipient mice from the SBP Animal vivarium to 
generate primary leukemias. 
 
Small-molecule library composition and design 
265 small-molecule inhibitors targeting diverse classes of epigenetic regulators were manually 
curated and purchased from various commercial sources by the Conrad Prebys Center for 
Chemical Genomics (Table S1).  
 
Flow-cytometry-based small-molecule screen 
Compounds were dispensed with the Labcyte Echo 555 (Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) acoustic 
droplet ejection dispenser to a final concentration of 0.11 µM and 10 µM, in technical triplicates. 
Human UB3 cells were then seeded in 384-well plates (PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc.) with 
a MicroClime® lid (Labcyte Inc.) at a density of 2,000 cells per well in 45 μl of culture medium 

NEW PAGE

using the Multidrop™ Combi Reagent Dispenser (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were incubated 
for 5 days at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, and 5 μl of Sytox Red viability stain was then 
added to the culture volume using the Multidrop™ Combi Reagent Dispenser. High throughput 
flow cytometry was performed in the HTS unit of the Fortessa 14-color (BD) at the SBP Flow 
Cytometry Core. Flow cytometry data was analyzed with Flowjo version 10.0.4 (Flowjo LLC). 
 
 
Quantitative RT-PCR 
The mRNA levels were measured by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using standard 
protocols. RNA was extracted using the RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was 
used to synthesize cDNA with the Protoscipt® II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England 
Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). For PCR-based amplification, cDNA and primers were added to the 
SYBR  Green  PCR  Master  mix  (ThermoFisher,  Carlsbad,  CA).  Expression  levels  for 
HOXA7,HOXA9, HOXA10, MEIS1, GAPDH and HPRT were determined with the oligo sequences 
listed in Table S4 and measured on the Stratagene MX3000P (Agilent Technologies). Relative 
quantity of mRNA was determined by the ΔΔCT method as previously described 150 using HPRT 
as the internal reference. 
 
Colony formation assays 
For murine leukemia colony forming cell (CFC) assays, CALM-AF10, MLL-AF9, and MLL-AF10 
lines  were  transduced  with  retroviral  particles  encoding  2  sgRNAs  targeting  Sgf29  exon 
sequences and one sgRNA targeting an intronic sequence of Sgf29 as a control (sequences 
provided in Table S4), cloned in pMSCV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (a gift from Sarah 
Teichmann, Addgene #102796). Cells were transduced by spinfection as described above and 
cultured  for 48 hours in the 37 °C incubator with 5% CO . Puromycin (2.5 µg/ml ) was then added 
2
to the cultures for 48 hours to select for puromycin resistant cells. 1000 cells were plated in 35 
mm dish, in duplicates, in 1mL Methylcellulose-based MethoCult M3234 medium (STEMCELL 
Technologies) supplemented with 10 ng/ml mIL6, 6 ng/ml mIL3 and 20 ng/ml mSCF (Peprotech) 
and colonies were scored on day 7. After scoring, colonies were washed with PBS, pooled, and 
counted  for  subsequent  replating.  A  sample  was  taken  for  cell  morphology  assessment, 
performed by spinning 100,000 cells resuspended in 150 μl PBS onto glass slides, using the 
Cytospin 4 cytocentrifuge (Thermo Scientific) followed by Wright-Giemsa staining. Cells were 
replated every week for 3 weeks at the same cell number to test secondary and tertiary replating 
potential. For colony assays with Lin- Sca+ c-Kit+ (LSK) murine cells, bone marrow cells from 

NEW PAGE

Cas9 transgenic  mice  (13)  were  lineage-depleted  using  the  EasySep  lineage  depletion  kit 
(STEMCELL Technologies) to obtain a lineage negative (Lin-) population. Lin- cells were then 
stained with the following antibodies: FITC- conjugated Streptavidin (eBioscience), Pacific Blue-
conjugated Sca-1 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), and Alexa647-conjugated cKit (Biolegend, San 
Diego, CA) and sorted for the Lin- Sca-1+ cKit+ (LSK) population using the FACSAria II cytometer 
(BD Biosciences). Cells were kept in culture overnight and transduced the following day with 
retroviral particles with sgRNAs targeting Sgf29 and an intron control, as described above. The 
cells were counted and plated for colony formation in M3434 methylcellulose-based media 
(STEMCELL Technologies) at a concentration of 10,000 cells per ml, as described above. 
Colonies were scored on day 10. 
 
Dye-dilution experiments  
To trace cell proliferation by flow cytometry, MOLM13 and U937 cells were transduced by 
spinfection with lentiviral particles containing sgRNAs targeting SGF29 or non-targeting controls 
(refer to Table S4), cloned in lentiGuide-Puro vector (a gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene #52963). 
Then, cells were incubated overnight and treated with 1 µg/ml puromycin for 3 days. Upon 
selection, the cells were washed and stained with the CellTrace™ Violet dye (ThermoFisher 
Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were maintained in culture in the 
dark and a sample (>10% of culture volume) was assayed every day for 6 days by flow cytometry. 
 
Viral preparation, transduction and selection  
Lentivirus was made from the CROP-seq pooled DNA by transfection of the CROP-seq pool 
together with Polyethylimine (PEI), pMD2.G, and psPAX2 in HEK293T cells, as described 
previously 215.  Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post-transfection, and then 
filtered (0.45 µm) and pooled. Viral supernatants were then concentrated by centrifugation 
(20,000 rpm, 2 hrs, 4° C) and used for transduction of UB3 cells by incubation with 0.8 µg/µl of 
polybrene overnight. Medium was changed after overnight incubation. At 48h post-transduction, 
puromycin (1µg/µl) was added to cell suspensions for 3 days of selection. Cells were  pelleted for 
sequencing 3 days after removal of puromycin.

Single cell sequencing 
Two independently transduced samples were sequenced for the CROP-Seq experiment. Cell 
concentration and viability was assessed using a hemocytometer and viability for all samples was 
> 80%. A total of 18,000 cells per sample were loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Instrument 
(10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). RNAseq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single 
Cell 3′ v3.1 Library, Gel Beads & Mutiplex Kit (10x Genomics). CDNA was PCR-amplified and 
purified using SPRIselect Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing was performed on the 
Illumina NovaSeq using the S4 200 kit and PE100 run configuration at the University of California 
San  Diego  Center  for  Epigenomics.  Cell  Ranger  Single-Cell  Software  Suite  (v4.0.0;  10x 
Genomics) was used for sample demultiplexing, alignment, filtering, and UMI counting.  
 
CROP-seq data analysis  
sgRNAs were detected in the fastq files via a custom script, which required a perfect match for 
either the 10bp upstream or 10bp downstream of the sgRNA, as well as the sgRNA sequence 
with at most 1 mismatch. If a partial sgRNA was located at the end of a sequence but at least 
10bp matched a unique sgRNA (along with the correct neighboring sequence), the read was 
counted as well (CropSeq_sgRNA_from_ fastq.cpp). 
 
10X fastq reads were trimmed using trim-galore (v0.6.6, flags -a AAAAAAAAAAAA --length 10) 
which relies on cutadapt (v2.5). Reads were aligned to the genome (hgGRCh38) using STAR 
(v2.7.3a). All multimapping reads were removed (samtools view -b -q 254), and reads were 
deduplicated by UMI using custom code (CropSeq_10x_Remove_Duplicates.cpp). Reads were 
then mapped to genes using bedtools v2.29.2. Reads spanning exon boundaries were split (-split 
flag used), and all reads were first mapped to exons (flags -f 0.95 -c 7 -o distinct) and then mapped 
to genes (-f 0.95 -c 4 -o distinct), such that a read mapping to overlapping genes is preferentially 
assigned to the gene in which it overlaps an exon.  Cells with fewer than 10^3.5 (3162) UMIs or 
fewer than 200 expressed genes, or whose barcodes were not on the 10x barcode whitelist were 
removed. Cells with more than one gRNA were also removed. Finally, genes present in fewer 
than 3 cells were not included in downstream analyses. General processing and evaluation of 
sgRNA target gene expression, was performed in R (CROPSeq_HOX.R). All plots in Figure 24 
were generated in R (CROPSeq_HOX.R). UMAP and ridgeplots were generated using the Seurat 

NEW PAGE

package. The dendrogram was generated using the R function dist(method = "euclidean") and 
hclust(method = "ward.D2"). The heatmap was generated using the pheatmap package. 
 
RNA-sequencing 
U937-MEIS1-GFP and MOLM13 cells were plated at a density of 1 million cells per ml in T75 
tissue culture flasks and transduced in triplicates with sgRNAs for non-targeting controls or 
SGF29. Cells were selected with puromycin as described above. 2 million cells were harvested 
at 7 days post-selection from every replicate and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA-seq Libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra II Directional 
RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for Illumina as per the manufacturer’s 
protocol. For each sample, 900 ng of total RNA was amplified in 10 cycles of PCR amplification. 
Sequencing was performed to obtain 1x75bp reads on the Illumina NextSeq500 by the Genomics 
core at SBP Medical Discovery Institute. Next-generation sequencing data were demultiplexed 
and processed with the Illumina Basespace RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis workflow.  
 
RNA-sequencing data analysis 
Raw  reads  were  preprocessed  by  trimming  Illumina  Truseq  adapters,  polyA,  and  polyT 
sequences  using  cutadapt  v2.3226  with  parameters  “cutadapt  -j  4  -m  20  --interleaved  -a 
AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC  -A 
AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT Fastq1 Fastq2 | cutadapt --interleaved -j 4 
-m 20 -a "A{100}" -A "A{100}" - | cutadapt -j 4 -m 20 -a "T{100}" -A "T{100}" -”. Trimmed reads 
were subsequently aligned to human genome version hg38 using STAR aligner  v2.7.0d_0221 
227 with parameters according to ENCODE long RNA-seq pipeline (https://github.com/ENCODE-
DCC/long-rna-seq-pipeline). Gene expression levels were quantified using RSEM v1.3.1 228. 
Ensembl v84 gene annotations were used for the alignment and quantification steps. RNA-seq 
sequence,  alignment,  and  quantification  qualities  were  assessed  using  FastQC  v0.11.5 
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)  and  MultiQC  v1.8  229.  Lowly 
expressed genes were filtered out by retaining genes with estimated counts (from RSEM) ≥ 
number of samples times 5. Filtered estimated read counts from RSEM were used for differential 
expression  comparisons  using  the  Wald  test  implemented  in  the  R  Bioconductor  package 
DESeq2 v1.22.2 based on generalized linear model and negative binomial distribution 230(Love, 
Huber et al. 2014). Genes with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 
2.0  or ≤ 2.0 were selected as differentially expressed genes. Pathway analyses of differential 

NEW PAGE

expression comparisons were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Redwood 
City, USA). 
  
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq)  
UB3 cells expressing Cas9 were transduced with sgRNAs for a non-targeting control or SGF29, 
as described for the dye-dilution experiment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as 
previously described 150. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and chromatin was sheared using 
a Bioruptor™ (Diagenode Inc, NJ) in 15 cycles (each one in high-setting for 30 s on and 30 s off), 
at 4°C.  Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using antibodies for normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling 
Technology, Cat. No, 2729) and  Histone H3K9ac (Abcam, ab4441). For SGF29 binding studies, 
U937 cells transduced with 3x Flag tagged SGF29 wt or D196R mutant viral supernatants were 
fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 minutes and chromatin was sheared as described earlier. 
Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using Anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma Aldrich, #A2220). 
Library preparation on eluted DNA was performed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit 
for Illumina (E7645S and E7600S) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA libraries were 
sequenced in paired-end 150 bp reads in a NovaSeq600 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by 
Novogene Corporation (Sacramento, CA).  
 
ChIP-seq processing methods 
Raw reads were processed with Cutadapt v2.3 to remove low-quality bases and TruSeq adapter 
contamination  using  parameters  “-j  12  -m  25  -O  5  -q  15  -a 
AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC”.  Trimmed  reads  were  first  mapped  to 
human chrM to remove reads mapping to it from downstream analysis using Bowtie2 v2.2.5 and 
parameters “--local”. Reads not mapped to chrM were aligned to human genome version hg38 
using  Bowtie2  “--very-sensitive”.  Unmapped,  multimapper,  and  PCR  duplicate  reads  were 
removed using sambamba v0.7.1 and parameters ‘sambamba view -h -t 8 -f bam -F "[XS] == null 
and not unmapped  and not duplicate"’. Genome coverage bigwig files were generated using 
deepTools bamCoverage v3.4.3 and parameters “--binSize 10 -p 12 --normalizeUsing RPGC --
effectiveGenomeSize 2913022398”. Peak-calling was performed using MACS2 v2.2.71 and 
parameters “--broad-cutoff 0.0001 -q 0.0001 –broad”. K4me3 and K27ac data in Fig. 5 were 
obtained from publicly available deposited files at: ENA biosample ID SAMEA2396211and GEO 
accession number GSM4083812, respectively.

 (ChEP) 
Five million U937 cells were transduced in 4 replicates with concentrated lentiviral supernatants 
containing a non-targeting control or sgRNAs targeting CSNK2A1 or SGF29 in the pKLV2-
U6gRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuro-2ABFP backbone (a gift from Kosuke Yusa, Addgene #67974; see 
Table 2 for sequences). 48 hours after transduction, cells were treated with 1 µg/ml puromycin for 
3 days. The cultures were grown for 7 days and counted for chromatin enrichment for proteomics 
procedure 231. Briefly, 100 million cells per replicate were collected by centrifugation for 5 minutes 
at 600 xg at room temperature and washed with pre-warmed PBS. Cells were then resuspended 
in  1%  formaldehyde  in  pre-warmed  PBS  and  incubated  for  10  min  at  37°C  in  a  rotator. 
Crosslinking was halted by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.25M and incubating for 5 
min at room temperature in a rotator. Cells were then washed with pre-warmed PBS and pellets 
were collected by centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 600 xg and stored at -80 °C. 
Pellets were thawed and resuspended in 1 ml cold cell lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton X-
100, 85 mM KCl, and protease inhibitors), transferred to 2 ml tubes, and homogenized carefully 
with a 200 μl pipette tip. The samples were then centrifuged for 2300 xg for 5 min at 4°C and the 
supernatants containing the cytoplasmic fraction were recovered and stored at -80°. The nuclei 
pellets were resuspended in 500 µl cell lysis buffer containing 200µl/ml RNAse A and were 
incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were then kept on ice and centrifuged at 2,300 xg for 10 
min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then discarded, and pellets were resuspended in 500 µl SDS 
buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 4% SDS, and protease inhibitors) with 200 µl pipette tips and 
incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 xg for 30 
min at room temperature and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed by 
resuspending in 500 µl SDS buffer with a 200 µl tip, then adding 1.5 ml urea buffer (10 mM Tris, 
1 mM EDTA, and 8 M urea) and mixing by inversion several times. The tubes were then spun 
down at 16,000 xg for 25 min at room temperature and supernatants were discarded. Urea was 
washed out by resuspending in 500 µl SDS buffer with a 200 µl tip, then adding 1.5 ml SDS buffer 
and mixing by inversion several times. The tubes were spun down at 16,000 xg for 25 min at room 
temperature and the pellets were covered with storage buffer (10 mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, 25 mM 
NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and flicked to dislodge the pellets. The pellets were 
transferred to Bioruptor® shearing tubes (Diagenode Inc, Denville, NJ) and sonicated in a 
Bioruptor® (Diagenode Inc., Denville, NJ) for 15 min in 15 cycles (each 30 s on, 30 s off on high-
intensity setting). The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 xg for 30 min at 4 °C and the 
supernatants were transferred to a new tube and stored at -80 °C for mass spectrometry analysis.

LC-MS/MS analysis 
For the chromatin-enriched for proteomics samples, 30 µg of each sample were processed using 
the ProTiFi S-trap™ digestion system. Mass spectrometry data were acquired on an Orbitrap 
Exploris 480 (ThermoFisher, Bremen, Germany) instrument at the Cedars Sinai Proteomics and 
Metabolomics Core in the Advanced Clinical Biosystems Research Institute. Desalted peptides 
were separated on an Ultimate 3000 ultra-high-pressure chromatography system with a 60-
min gradient. Peptides were separated on a gradient of 1% B organic phase for 2 minutes, 1-5% 
B for 0.5 minutes, 5-9% B for 3.5 minutes, 9-27% B for 39 minutes, and 27-44% B for the final 15 
minutes on a C18 column (15 cm length, 300 µm diameter) at a flow rate of 9.5 nL/min. Source 
parameters included spray voltage at 3 kV, capillary temp of 300 °C , and RF funnel level of 40%. 
MS1  resolutions  were  set  to 60,000 and  AGC  was  set  to “standard” with  ion  transmission 
of 100ms. Mass range of 400-1000 and AGC target value for fragment spectra of 300% were 
used. Peptide ions were fragmented at a normalized collision energy of 30%. Fragmented ions 
were detected across 50 DIA windows of 12 Da. MS2 resolutions were set to 15,000 with an ion 
transmission time of 25 ms. All data were acquired in profile mode using positive polarity. The 
data were searched using the DIA-NN tool against a human in silico digested sequence reference 
library.  
 
Data analysis for ChEP 
Protein peak data (mz/rt) were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Missing values were imputed 
by replacing them with 1/5th of the minimum positive values of their corresponding variables. No 
data filtering was applied. Important features were selected based on fold change analysis with a 
threshold of 2 and t-test and P. values below 0.05.     
 
Statistical Analysis 
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.7.1 (FlowJo Software, Tree Star, Ashland, 
OR). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 Software (San Diego).  
 
Western and dot blotting 
Whole cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer containing the Halt™ protease inhibitor cocktail for 30 
min on ice (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). Protein supernatant was collected after 30 
min of 12,000 rpm centrifugation at 4°C and stored at -80°C until use. Protein concentrations from 
whole cell lysates were determined using the Pierce™ BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher 

NEW PAGE

Scientific).  For  the  immunoblotting,  the  following  antibodies  were  used:  KAT2A  (Abcam, 
ab217876),  Flag  M2  (Sigma-Aldrich,  F1804),  Vinculin  (Sigma-Aldrich,  V9131),  H3  (Abcam, 
ab1791), and SGF29 (Abcam, ab204367). Protein samples (50µg total protein) were resolved by 
SDS-PAGE using 4-12% Bis-Tris Bolt™ gels (Invitrogen, NW04120BOX) and transferred to 
iBlot2™ nitrocellulose membranes (ThermoFisher Scientific, IB23002).  The membranes were 
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered Saline containing 0.01% tween-20 (0.01% TBST). 
The membranes were probed with species-specific goat anti-rabbit (MilliporeSigma, AP307P) or 
goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher Scientific, 31446) HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and 
detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Thermo Fisher, Carlsbad, CA). 
 
 
Cell Cycle Analysis 
500,000 MLL-AF10 PDX cells expressing NTC or SGf29 sgRNA were washed with cold PBS and 
fixed with chilled 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were incubated at -20°C for 1 hr. Cells were then 
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min. at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in PBS containing RNAse A 
and Propidium Iodide (PI) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. in dark and analysed using flow 
cytometry.
