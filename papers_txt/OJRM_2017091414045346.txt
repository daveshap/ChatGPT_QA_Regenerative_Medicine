1. Introduction 
If one uses the key words “post-operative cutaneous scarring” and conducts a 
search using the PubMed search engine, you receive notice of only sixty-seven 
past publications in this field. As with most collations, some publications are not 
relevant. The last publications were in 2015. The second paper in the given list, 
also a 2015 publication, by van den Broek L. J. et al. [1] states that: 1) wound 
healing is studied at one point in time, even though the process is dynamic and 
takes months, even years; 2) any results from animal models are difficult to 
extrapolate to the human condition because of differences in scar tissue, physi-
ology and immunology. 
However, from animal studies and cytotoxic tests using murine fibroblasts,

surgical sutures, foreign bodies which trigger a localised immune response (Ro-
sique R.G. et al., 2015 [2]; Robson MC and Barbul A., 2006 [3]), have been ap-
proved. 
2. Multicellular Rosettes 
This author has described epidermal brown rosettes as natural, living intra-epidermal 
micro patterns within the human epidermis [4]. Congruent with this finding was 
the later review by Harding et al. (2014) [5] and references therein, which dis-
cussed the wide role played by multicellular rosettes in morphogenesis of diverse 
organ systems describing them as polarized, transient epithelial structures which 
sometimes recapitulate the form of the adult organ. They noted their occurrence 
in developmental contexts such as in the zebrafish lateral line primordium, the 
vertebrate pancreas, the Drosophila epithelium and retina, in the adult neural 
stem cell niche and in stem cell populations. These rosettes were defined as mul-
ticellular structures in which five or more cells interface at a central point and 
their remodelling contributes to the formation of a functional organ. Multicellu-
lar rosettes are, in their words, “a broadly utilized mechanism during morpho-
genesis”; however they noted that the extracellular matrix cues that trigger their 
formation are not well understood. In the regeneration of damaged skin tissue, it 
could be expected that a biological recapitulation of this theme might occur lay-
ing bare a congruency with the previously mentioned human skin epidermal ro-
settes. 
3. The Dermis 
It is known that the dermis consists of primary fibroblasts (Hastings and Sha-
piro, 2016) [6]. This author has demonstrated, albeit in an in vitro setting, that 
un-manipulated primary (P) human dermal reticular fibroblasts retain their 
0
spatial configuration and their signature packing arrangement at an angle to the 
vertical [7]. Whether these cells have a short- or long-term memory has not been 
determined. However, it is well known that T-cells retain a bank of “long-lived 
memory-cells” (Macallan et al., 2017) [8] as a defence against future pathogen 
challenge. Human skin is protected by four functionally and phenotypically dis-
crete populations of resident and recirculating memory T-cells (Watanabe et al., 
2015) [9]. Also, the dermis does not only contain fibroblasts. There are mast 
cells, microvascular endothelial cells, dendritic cells, multipotent mesenchymal 
stromal cells (MSCs), Merkel cells just to name a few other cell residents. 
4. Reasons for a Scientific Hands-On Involvement 
Any proposal of autologous cell therapy, suggesting the collection of a skin tissue 
segment immediately post-surgery with the intention of culturing the patient’s 
own cells envisages the handing over of the skin tissue segment to specialist bio-
medical scientists. Secondly, deploying any live cells to wounds closed by using 
sutures/staples/tape post-operatively would require experienced hands. A tech-

nique must be perfected, which will require a joint effort between medical per-
sonnel and biomedical scientists. 
No stem cell use is initially being put forward because its use would necessari-
ly need the absolute knowledge of the “threshold quantity” of cells which would 
not evoke an eruption of tissue inflammation. Newspaper reports have spoken of 
patients travelling abroad (outside of the UK) to receive stem cell injections for 
various ailments, only to find they needed to rush back to the UK for urgent 
hospital treatment due to unforeseen tissue inflammation (also see [10] [11]). 
5. Concept 
The autologous cell therapy being proposed will involve both epidermal and 
dermal cells being applied in stepwise fashion, provided a skin tissue segment 
and a sample of the patient’s blood, for preparation of serum/plasma are ob-
tained post-surgery. The donor site of the small skin tissue segment must be as 
close to the incision line as possible. To state the obvious, this will insure the lat-
er laboratory harvest of ‘local’ populations of both epidermal and dermal cells. 
There will be no manipulation of said cells in culture since only primary (P ) 
0
cells will be used. A skin segment will be broken down into its cellular compart-
ments with a singular enzymatic use to achieve separation of the epidermis from 
the dermis. This author has described full details of these methods in previous 
publications [4] [12]. 
In a cell culture laboratory, the disassembling epidermis resembles a stack of 
coins, whose structure is being dismantled on a vertical axis [4]. Interestingly, 
within the chloroplast of a leaf, the thylakoids in a granum, also strongly and 
distinctly resemble a small stack of coins. This displays a degree of commonality 
in Nature’s structural blueprint [13]. Research studies have been concentrated 
on expansion of keratinocytes in culture, and not the epidermal rosettes for ap-
plication to wound beds, the latest publication being Martin et al. (2017) [14], 
using compressed collagen and microcarriers. They commented on the loss of 
cells in an applied suspension due to a lack of adhesion to the wound bed. This 
point was actively considered and specifically addressed in the described me-
thodology. Plasma properties are given below and there is a correlation with oral 
surgery where fibroblast-induced repair, using plasma enriched with growth fac-
tors (PRGF-Endoret), was found to stimulate the proliferation and migration of 
primary keratinocytes and conjunctival fibroblasts [15]. 
6. Consideration of Wound Exudates 
It is recognized that in undamaged skin, plasma bathes the interstices of skin 
tissue. In damaged skin, serum factors are released. Therefore, all cells will be 
isolated and immersed in the patient’s plasma. Of primary importance, before 
any cell transplantation is undertaken, a culture of the wound’s drainage fluid or 
exudate should be conducted to determine if there is pathogen growth (Can-
dau-Alvarez A. et al., 2015) [16]. Concomitantly, it might be informing, to draw

a parallel with burn bound exudates, and test for the skin-specific chemokine 
CCL27, with regard to an indication of scar formation (Widgerow AD et al., 
2015) [17]. 
7. Methodology 
7.1. Epidermis 
The collected skin segment will be taken to a tissue culture laboratory, rinsed, 
subcutaneous fat trimmed off and cut into small pieces. They are upturned (epi-
dermis-side down) in a small pool of Dispase [5] and put into an incubator at 
37˚C for overnight incubation. The next morning, in the flow cabinet, the epi-
dermis from each piece of skin tissue will be peeled off using a pair of forceps, 
and immersed in DPBS. The epidermis will disassemble on a vertical axis into 
the previously described epidermal rosettes. No attempt will be made to identify 
“upright” or “inverted” rosettes. Some inverted rosettes will be basal layer rosettes, 
containing “live” melanocytes and epidermal-melanin units [5] to aid pigmenta-
tion restoration. They will all be transferred, after pooling, to a plastic centrifuge 
tube containing an aliquot of the patient’s plasma. Using a pipette aspirator, they 
will be drawn up into the pipette and are now ready for transplantation directly 
onto the wound bed. 
The epidermal rosettes described above will be subcutaneously transplanted in 
toto. This has not been attempted in any study thus far and will provide hope-
fully, an accelerated means of restoring the epithelial barrier. If a delay is sought, 
for example, to wait until wound exudate has ceased or cultured, it is known that 
the epidermal rosettes do maintain their structural integrity in vitro as was 
clearly observed when a co-culture of epidermal rosettes, dermal microvascular 
endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts was attempted [12]. They do not shed 
their load of cells onto a plastic surface; only onto a cell matrix [4]. In this in-
stance, they will be pipetted into a plastic culture flask topped up with an aliquot 
of plasma (to allow for evaporation loss) and stored in the incubator. 
7.2. Dermis 
After the epidermis is removed, the dermis will be rinsed, as described previously 
[4] [12] and each tissue piece, scraped with a scalpel with attached blade. Scrap-
ings, consisting of both papillary and reticular fibroblasts will be shaken off into 
a plastic centrifuge tube containing an aliquot of the patient’s plasma. These der-
mal cells, after pooling, are now ready for subcutaneous transplantation. Further 
scrapings, deeper into the dermis will yield reticular fibroblasts and other resi-
dent dermal phenotypically discrete populations. 
Subsequently, there are two ways to proceed. If a delay is sought, these cells 
may be pipetted into a culture flask, topped up with an aliquot of plasma and 
incubated. It is known that confluence occurs in 9 days. For a shorter time pe-
riod to confluence, the fibroblasts can be pipetted onto a pre-prepared dermal 
fibroblast matrix contained in a culture flask.

Care will be taken to aid the healing process while not overly interfering by 
adding a cellular overload. A cell pellet of dermal fibroblasts was considered, and 
then rejected, through fear of creating an in situ inflammatory site. There will be 
no discomfort experienced by the patient. Of course, results will need to be eva-
luated to determine whether the procedure needs tweaking, meaning that the 
treatment interval needs to be extended. However, this would now necessarily 
involve using P dermal cells, obtained by using 5 mM EDTA/DPBS (pH 7.4) as 
1
previously described [12] (Ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid/Dulbecco’s phos-
phate- buffered saline) or using a cell scraper which will yield a dermal fibroblast 
cell cluster population plus fragments of their extracellular matrix (ECM). Great 
care will have to be taken in the choice of a plastic pipette with a sufficiently wide 
tip to insure that the structural integrity of the cell clusters are maintained. 
8. Conclusion 
A pilot study will determine the efficacy of the described methodology and 
compare the results with less complicated wounds healed by “primary intention” 
(Summers and Siegle, 1993) [18] using sutures, staples or tape. Finally, lengths of 
sutures used to close a wound will get exposed to primary epidermal and dermal 
cells. It will be of note whether the inflammatory response is dampened (see 
Georgiev-Hristov T. et al., 2012) [19]. Another use for this technique could be in 
the healing of the donor site after a skin graft is obtained. If the obtained skin 
graft was slightly larger than necessary, a small tissue segment could be handed 
over for the isolation of autologous cells as detailed above. 
Notes 
1) An off-the-cuff idea which might find fertile ground with my academic 
peers. Since the dermal fibroblasts will be lying in the patient’s own plasma 
awaiting transplantation, the plasma will become “conditioned” by their secre-
tions (ECM components and fibroblast growth factors). Table I [12] lists some of 
those secretions. Also, human blood plasma is more than an ordinary fluid; it 
exhibits viscoelastic behaviour (see Brust M. et al., 2013) [20]. Hence, considera-
tion might be given to the use of the dermal fibroblast conditioned plasma as a 
means of “nutritious irrigation” of the wound site. 
2) It is to be hoped that the methodology described herein will lead to a more 
aesthetically pleasing result than the skin blemish obtained by micrografting 
[21]. 
Conflicts of Interest 
None since this is a proposed medical treatment. However, there are granted UK 
patents to the author with respect to: 1) the epidermal basal layer rosettes, but 
they are not being specifically isolated for identification and study here; 2) isola-
tion of human dermal papillary and/or reticular fibroblasts by mechanical abra-
sion (scraping with a scalpel and attached blade).
