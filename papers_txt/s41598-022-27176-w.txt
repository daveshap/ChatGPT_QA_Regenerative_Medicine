Acellular matrix is a commonly used biomaterial in the field of biomedical engineering and 
revascularization is the key process to affect the effect of acellular matrix on tissue regeneration. 
The application of bioactive factors related to angiogenesis has been popular in the regulation 
of revascularization, but the immune system clearance, uncontrollable systemic reactions, and 
other factors make this method face challenges. Recent reports showed that engineered cells into 
nanovesicles can reorganize cell membranes and encapsulate cellular active factors, extending the 
in vitro preservation of cytokines. However, the problems of exogenous biological contamination and 
tumorigenicity restricted the clinical transformation and wide application of this method. Here, we 
for the first time engineer stromal vascular fraction (SVF) which is extracted from fat into nanovesicles 
(SVF-EVs) for angiogenesis in the acellular matrix. SVF-EVs not only promote the migration of vascular 
endothelial cells in vitro, but also facilitate the lipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. 
In vivo, SVF-EVs enhanced the retention of decellularized adipose tissue after transplanting to 
the subcutaneous area of nude mice. Immunofluorescence staining further showed that SVF-EVs 
promoted the formation of vascular networks with large lumen diameter in the grafted acellular 
matrix, accompanied by adipocyte regeneration peripherally. These findings reveal that SVF-EVs can 
be a viable method for accelerating revascularization in acellular matrix, and this process of squeezing 
tissue into nanovesicles shows the potential for rapid clinical transformation.
Acellular matrix has been used since the beginning of the 1990s to resolve some of the issues associated with 
insufficient sources of autologous materials and suboptimal bioactivity of synthetic materials, and it is widely used 
in clinical practice for filling tissue defects, trauma repair, and facial contour  remodeling1–4. Revascularization 
of the acellular matrix is a key issue that affects the outcome of therapeutic  procedures5,6. During preparation, 
the acellular matrix is completely stripped off the vascular endothelial cells, and even the walls of some fine 
vessels are damaged to varying  degrees7. The acellular matrix loses its original vascular network and requires 
revascularization to achieve blood perfusion after implantation in the body. However, the inflammation, hypoxic 
state, and lack of growth factors at the implantation site are often not conducive to revascularization, which in 
turn affects the effectiveness of acellular matrix repair of the  defect8,9. How to promote the angiogenic process 
of acellular matrix has become one of the research hotspots in regenerative  medicine10.

Many studies on vascularization have identified a set of growth factors and cytokines that act sequentially 
to cause vascular endothelial cell migration and morphological changes, culminating in forming a connected 
vascular network within the t issue11,12. The identified growth factors include Angiopoietin (Ang), hypoxia induc-
ible factor (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and so on, which 
have been used to vascularize grafts or  biomaterials13–17. Nevertheless, owing to the short half-life caused by 
direct host-facing immune system clearance, bioactive factors are depleted before forming an effective vascular 
n etwork18. These factors may be involved in other regulating pathways that can cause metabolic disturbances, 
structural abnormalities, and even tumorigenic effects, limiting the use of growth factors to promote vascu-
larization in the acellular  matrix19,20. In recent years, cell product like nanovesicles, containing growth factors 
shows lower healthcare risk and systemic reaction, leading to good application potential and research v alue21–23.
Extracellular vesicles are nanoscale biological products secreted by cells that transport biological information 
between cells and the extracellular  matrix24. They can contain various bioactive substances, including proteins, 
mRNAs, miRNAs, and other  components25. These components can be preserved for a longer time and exert 
biological activity owing to the protective effect of the phospholipid envelope of extracellular  vesicles26. Studies 
have revealed that extracellular vesicles derived from vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and mesenchymal stem 
cells exist promising pro-angiogenic  effects27,28. However, natural extracellular vesicles are exclusively secreted 
by cells, and related study has demonstrated that each cell secretes very little vesicles per  day29. Collecting these 
specific cell-generated extracellular vesicles from body fluids is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The 
artificial synthesis of nanovesicles, such as culturing special types of cells to obtain vesicles, and the formation 
of liposomes by water–oil interface interaction, has an effective formation rate and product c onsistency30–33. But 
the inevitable addition of drugs, reagents, and other substances kept it far from clinical  application34.
Studies have depicted that mechanical shear can rupture cell membranes and that, in a suitable environment, 
fragmented segments of cell membranes exhibit mobility and reassemble into intact spherical envelopes using 
energy gained from ATP  hydrolysis35–37. In 2017, Kim et al.35 obtained vesicles with 100–200 nm diameters 
after passing cells through filter membranes with different pore sizes. These vesicles, also known as “engineered 
vesicles”, can be obtained in significant numbers by simple physical pushing and squeezing and have been suc-
cessfully used to transform erythrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells into active protein-encapsulated vesicles. 
The amount of encapsulated proteins and number of prepared vesicles also increased. The existing techniques for 
preparing engineered vesicles enable the transformation of cells into nanovesicles, but applying in vitro cultured 
cell in clinical practice still raises ethical concerns such as tumorigenicity and immunogenicity testing. Stromal 
vascular fractions (SVF) are bioactive components extracted from adipose tissue and contain endothelial cells, 
pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and extracellular matrix, which are clinically use-
ful tissue  components38. Many studies have demonstrated that SVF promotes vascularization and has also been 
used in clinic to increase volume retention after autologous fat  grafting38,39. We speculate that the engineered 
squeezing process has the potential to convert SVF into engineered nanovesicles and retain the bioactive effect 
of SVF. This promising product may enhance tissue regeneration and exhibit clinical availability similar to SVF, 
and the simple process makes it cost-effective for clinical use.
In this study, for the first time, we prepared biological tissue samples (not pure cells), SVF, into engineered 
nanovesicles (SVF-EVs) by the shear action of filter membranes with different pore sizes and co-transplanted 
them with readily available decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) to test their angiogenic effects. Transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were used to investigate the morphological 
characteristics of the engineered vesicles. Western blotting was subsequently used to study the content of pro-
angiogenic proteins encapsulated within the vesicles. The effect of engineered vesicles on the cellular behavior 
of vascular endothelial cells and adipose mesenchymal stem cells was studied in vitro, and the effect of vesicles 
on vascularization of the acellular matrix was evaluated histologically.
Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Wuhan Union Hospital, and all methods were carried 
out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Fabrication of SVF-EVs.  Adipose tissue collected via liposuction from healthy female donors were 
obtained from the plastic surgery within Wuhan Union Hospital, and these donors signed informed consent 
forms for the study before surgery. Tissue samples were washed three times with sterile normal saline (Huaren 
Pharm., China) and centrifuged at 65×g for 5 min to remove solution. 10 mL adipose tissues were transferred 
into a 20-mL syringe which connected with another 20-mL syringe through a Luer-Lok taper, and then squeezed 
repeatedly within 1 min. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 2000×g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the 
oil layer was discarded, the remaining portion was saved and the connective tissue remnants in it were picked 
out by fine needle. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was further ultrasonicated at 4 °C for 5 min and followed 
by centrifugation at 2000×g for 5 min. After processing, the floating cream layer was removed, the remain-
ing fraction was subjected to sequentially extrusion five times through polycarbonate filter membranes with 
decreasing apertures (10 μm, 5 μm and 1 μm) using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) as previous literatures 
described. Finally, after stored at 4 °C over 2 h, the sample was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 
70 min at 4 °C, the resulting EVs was deposited in the bottom of ultra-centrifugal tube and then resuspended in 
normal saline for further research.
Characterization of SVF-EVs.  Morphology of SVF-EVs was characterized by a transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM, HT7800, HITACHI, Japan) as previous  description40. The particle size distribution and 
concentration of SVF-EVs were assessed using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA, NanoSight 300, Malvern

Panalytical, UK) equipped with a blue laser (405 nm) as before described. The sample was diluted  103 times with 
sterile normal saline and the quantities of diameter and concentration of SVF-EVs were displayed through image 
visualization.
Western blotting.  To detect the presence of tetraspanin proteins (TSG101 and CD81) in membrane, 
lipogenesis-related proteins (PPARγ and CEBPα) and angiogenic-related proteins (Ang-1 and VEGF) in the 
contents, proteins were harvested from SVF-EVs contents with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime, Hainan, Jiangsu, 
China) supplemented with phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) protease inhibitor. Denatured protein sam-
ples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then trans-
ferred to PVDF membranes. Then membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, and incubated with specific 
antibodies against TSG101 (ab133586, Abcam, UK), CD81(ab109201, Abcam, UK), PPARγ (sc-7273, Santa, 
USA), CEBPα (sc-365318, Santa, USA), Ang-1 (23302-1-AP, Sanying, China) and VEGF (66828-1-Ig, Sanying, 
China) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with secondary antibodies which are purchased 
from GeneTex (Irvine, USA). Protein bands were visualized by the FluorChem Imaging System (ProteinSimple, 
San Jose, USA) using the Amersham Hyperfilm ECL reagent.
Cellular uptake assay.  PKH26 was used to label the fabricated particles following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from the National Collection 
of Authenticated Cell Cultures (China) and used as the recipient cells. HUVECs were incubated with PKH26-
labeled SVF-EVs for 2 and 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS, Hyclone, USA) and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (PS, Servicebio, China), and washed three times 
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Servicebio, China). Then the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated 
Anti-CD31 (Abcam, UK) overnight at 4 °C. After washed by PBS, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole (DAPI, Beyotime, China) and observed by a laser confocal microscope (A1Si, Nikon, Japan).
Effects of SVF-EVs on HUVECs migration in vitro.  The protein concentration of SVF-EVs was deter-
mined using BCA assay and then the fabricated vesicles were respectively added to the culture medium to a final 
protein concentration of 20 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL. HUVECs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 ×  104 
cells/well and cultured until they reached a 90% confluence. Before scratching in the culture plate, HUVECs 
were starved and cultured in medium without FBS. Next, scratches were made on the cell surface layers using a 
pipette tip. The medium in each well were replaced with RPMI 1640 medium (without FBS) supplemented with 
0 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs. The cell images in each well were captured using an optical micro-
scope (Ts2, Nikon, Japan) at time 0, 6 and 12 h during culturing. The wound areas were quantified via measuring 
5 wells of each group using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, USA) as previously r eported41.
Effect of SVF-EVs on adipogenesis of ADSCs in vitro.  Isolation of ADSCs and oil red O staining.  AD-
SCs were isolated from human adipose tissue and cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Hy-
clone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin using the method 
described in previous r eport40. ADSCs were incubated with PKH26-labeled SVF-EVs for 2 h, then stained with 
calcein AM (Aladdin, China) and DAPI according to the kit’s instruction book, and observed by confocal mi-
croscope.
Then ADSCs were seeded into 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 1 04 cell per well and grown to 50% confluence. 
The protein concentration of SVF-EVs was determined using BCA assay and then the fabricated vesicles were 
respectively added to the culture medium to a final protein concentration of 40 ng/mL. The control group was 
treated with the same volume of sterilized normal saline and the culture medium in three groups was changed 
every other day. Oil Red O staining was conducted at days 7 and 14 of culture according to the manufacturer’s 
instruction (Solarbio, China). The cells were washed again with distilled water and observed with an inverted 
aberration microscope (Ts2, Nikon, Japan). The quantitative statistics of Oil Red O positive area were quantified 
via measuring 5 images of each wells using Image-Pro Plus softwareas previously  reported42.
qRT‑PCR analysis.  Total RNA was extracted from ADSCs cultured for 14 days in the 0 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL 
SVF-EVs group using SeraMir RNA purification kit (System Biosciences, USA). Primers used for qRT-PCR 
analysis was presented in Table 1 and the process was performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System 
(Applied Biosystems, USA) as the manufacturer’s instruction.

Western blotting.  The total proteins of cells in the 0 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs group were assessed by the 
BCA assay, and then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Each blot was blocked with 
5% skimmed milk, and incubated were immunodetected with specific antibodies against PPARγ (Santa, USA), 
FAS (Santa, USA), adiponectin (ADPN, Santa, USA), and GADPH (Antgene, China) overnight at 4 °C. The 
membrane was then incubated with secondary antibodies and the protein bands were visualized visualized by 
the FluorChem Imaging System (ProteinSimple, San Jose, USA) using the Amersham Hyperfilm ECL reagent.
Preparation of DAT.  DAT was prepared according to previous r eport43. Briefly, subcutaneous fat harvested 
via liposuction from donors at the Wuhan Union hospital and subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles. With wash-
ing and centrifuging at 1200×g for 5 min, the samples separated into three layers and the middle matrix layer was 
collected and then digested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% EDTA (Servicebio, China). After enzymatic digestion, 
the tissues were washed and subjected to polar solvent extraction using isopropanol at for 48 h 37 °C. The sam-
ples were subsequently treated with enzymatic digestion solution containing 20 ng/mL DNAse (Sigma, USA), 
and 20 ng/mL RNAse (Sigma, USA) for 16 h at 37 °C. Then, the processed tissues were rinsed with PBS 3 times 
and subjected to another 48 h’ extraction using isopropanol to remove reminded lipid. After several washes with 
PBS, DAT was collected and stored in absolute ethanol at 4 °C until needed.
Adipose tissue and prepared DAT were dehydrated via a graded alcohol series and embedded in paraffin. After 
cut the samples into sections in 5 μm thickness, the DAPI staining was performed to investigate the nucleus in 
tissues. Hematoxylin & Eosin (HE), Masson’s Trichrome (Masson), and Oil Red O staining were conducted to 
distinguish the tissue structure changes between adipose tissue and DAT.
Adhesion and viability of ADSCs in prepared DAT.  The adhesion and viability of ADSCs in prepared 
DAT were evaluated according to the previous  study44. Briefly, DAT particles were placed in 24-well plates and 
ADSCs were seeded on DAT at 2 ×  104 per 50 μL media and then kept in a cell incubator for 2 h. Subsequently, 
1 mL DMEM media was added into the well and changed every other day. To evaluate the adhesion and viability 
of ADSCs in prepared DAT, the cell-DAT constructs were stained using a Live/Dead assay at 1, 4, and 7 days of 
culture. Observing by the confocal microscopy, living cells were stained with fluorescein diacetate (FDA, Sigma) 
and dead cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma). The integrated optical density (IOD) was calcu-
lated by Image-Pro Plus software.
Animal study.  All mice used in this study were purchased from the animal center of Huazhong University 
of Science and Technology (HUST) and the experimental protocols concerning animal were approved by the 
Animal Ethical Committee of HUST. In this study, animal experiments were conducted under the supervision 
of the Animal Center of HUST and in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Four-week-old male 
BALB/c nude mice were fed in the specific pathogen-free animal facilities and maintained under conventional 
conditions.
10 mL prepared DAT was trimmed into microparticles which could be injected with 18-G needles and SVF-
EVs were respectively added to the injectant to a final protein concentration of 40 ng/mL. Twelve nude mice were 
randomly divided into two groups (0 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs) and then injected 0.3 mL of injectant into 
their dorsal region. Mice were sacrificed by cervical vertebra dislocation at 4 weeks and 8 weeks’ post-injection, 
and the grafts were harvested and weighed for volume.
The harvested samples were dehydrated via a graded alcohol series and embedded in paraffin. After cut the 
samples into sections in 5 μm thickness, HE staining was conducted to distinguish the tissue structure. Sections 
used for immunofluorescent staining were incubated with primary perilipin (Abcam, UK), CD31 (Abcam, UK) 
antibody and subsequently respectively incubated with FITC- and PE- conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody 
(Servicebio, China). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI stain. Moreover, a CD31immunohistochemical 
staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Yaji Bio, China). The images of histological 
analysis were captured by a Nikon Ni microscope.
Statistical analysis.  All data collected in this work were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed with SPSS 
21.0 software (IBM, USA). A Student’s t test was used for the comparisons between two groups and one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with post hoc contrasts by Newman–Keuls test was used to analyze differ-
ences in multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference.
ARRIVE guidelines.  This study is conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.
Results
Characteristics of SVF-EVs.  Analysis of TEM images (Fig. 1A) illustrated that SVF-EVs displayed 100 nm 
spherical vesicles enclosed by a bilayer lipid membrane. The NTA of SVF-EVs (Fig. 1B) confirmed the size dis-
tribution with a range of diameter around 100–300 nm. Western blot analysis revealed that SVF-EVs express 
tetraspanin proteins (Fig. 1C), such as CD81 and TSG101, and some proteins (Fig. 1D), such as PPARγ, C/
EBPα, Ang-1 and VEGF. After 2 h of co-culture (Fig. 1E), the PKH26-labeled SVF-EVs (red) were internalized 
into CD31-labeled HUVECs (green) and surrounded the nucleus (blue). And with the increase of co-culture 
time, the concentration of engineered vesicles inside cells increased and showed stronger red fluorescence under 
confocal microscope (Fig. 1F).

proteins such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, Ang-1, and VEGF. (E) Confocal images verify the internalization of PKH26-
labeled SVF-EVs (red) into endothelial cell (CD31-labeled, green), and the amount of endocytosed SVF-EVs 
after co-culturing for 4 h is more than that for 2 h (F).
Effects of SVF-EVs on HUVECs migration in vitro.  The general HUVECs migration trend for the three 
groups is shown in Fig. 2A, SVF-EVs at 40 ng/mL exhibit a more obvious effect of promoting HUVECs migra-
tion than that with no SVF-EVs or low concentration of SVF-EVs (20 ng/mL). The wound area in three groups 
are calculated and the result is shown in Fig. 2B. The quantitative analysis reveals that the residual wound area 
of the 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs group at the 12th hour (182.89 ± 20.39 ×  10−3  mm2) was less than that of the 20 ng/mL 
SVF-EVs group (214.15 ± 13.76 × 1 0−3  mm2) and blank group (240.16 ± 13.85 ×  10−3  mm2), and the difference has 
statistically significant (p < 0.01, n = 5).
Effects of SVF-EVs on adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs in vitro.  Confocal microscopy images 
(Fig. 3A and S1) illustrate that PKH26-labeled SVF-EVs (red) were endocytosed by ADSCs (green). Images 
(Fig. 3B) from the Oil Red O staining and quantitative statistics of Oil Red O positive area (Fig. 3C) show 
that SVF-EVs promote lipids synthesis in ADSCs, and the amounts of synthetic lipid are correlated with the 
co-cultured time. To further investigate the mechanisms of adipogenesis in vitro, qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3D) 
was performed and showed that the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as PPARγ, FAS, and ADPN in 
ADSCs co-cultured with 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs are higher than that without SVF-EVs. Western blot (Fig. 3E) and 
quantitative analysis of optical density (Fig. 3F) verified that the protein levels of PPARγ, FAS, and ADPN are 
significantly increased in ADSCs treated with SVF-EVs.
Characteristics and histological investigation of the prepared DAT.  DAT appeared an ivory white 
in contrast to the yellow appearance of adipose tissue (Fig. 4A). After the decellularization progress, DAPI stain-
ing (Fig. 4B) demonstrated that DAT was cell-free and histological analysis (Fig. 4C) revealed the DAT was

mainly composed of collagen and was disordered due to the loss of the compact arrangement structure of adipo-
cytes. Oil Red O staining showed that the lipid was also completely removed after decellularization.
Biocompatibility evaluation of the prepared DAT.  The live/dead staining of ADSCs at day 1, 4 and 7 
(Fig. 5A) showed that a large number of living cells (green) could be seen in the prepared DAT, indicating that 
ADSCs have good viability on the acellular matrix. Meanwhile, the number of dead ADSCs (red) remained low 
and did not change significantly with the increase of culture time. Figure 5B was the quantitative results of the 
relative integral optical density of FDA and PI labeled cells.
In vivo study.  Figure 6A and B respectively showed the macroscopic images of the grafts after subcutane-
ous transplanted in nude mouse for 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The grafts presented a soft tissue appearance with a 
complete capsule, and the volume of grafts after transplanting for 8 weeks decreased significantly compared 
with that at 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of subcutaneous transplantation of DAT along with SVF-EVs (40 ng/mL), 
the volume of harvested grafts was 205.41 ± 47.34  mm3 compared to 176.33 ± 51.50  mm3 in the blank (0 ng/mL) 
group, which was no statistically different between the two groups (Fig. 6C). But after transplanted for 8 weeks, 
the volume of grafts in SVF-EVs was 103.81 ± 19.18  mm3 and that in blank group was 60.33 ± 23.71  mm3, the 
difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05, n = 3).
After 4 weeks of transplantation (Fig. 6D), there was obvious cell infiltration in the peripheral area of DAT, 
while the density of cells entering the central area of DAT was less. In the 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs group, representa-
tive graft images showed some continuous vacuolated structures (green triangle) appeared at the graft edge. 
Furthermore, when HE staining was performed on grafts eight weeks after transplantation (Fig. 6E), we found 
that such vacuolated structures increased in numbers in the 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs group, and vacuolated structures 
were present not only at the periphery of the grafts, but also at the central area.
To further clarify the structures of the harvested grafts, we further performed immunofluorescent staining 
for perilipin and CD31. The results (Fig. 7A,B) found that the vacuolated structures can be labeled with green 
perilipin fluorescence and indicate adipocytes. Compared with the blank group, grafted with 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs 
promoted the formation of adipocytes in DAT, and this effect was significant over time. CD31 immunofluorescent 
staining images (Fig. 7C,D) exhibited that a large number of new blood vessels with significantly larger lumen

Discussion
Vascularization is a critical physiological step for survival and regeneration after tissue transplantation, and 
inadequate vascularization in practice has led to many clinical problems that are difficult to resolve. Lack of 
vascularization in the center of chronic wounds leads to slow growth of granulation tissue and difficult healing, 
insufficient perfusion of the distal part of the flap after transplantation causes vascular crisis, and the lack of 
blood supply to the follicular unit transplanted in the scar area appears an infertile survival. In this study, we 
prepared SVF as nanoscale vesicles and proved its promotion of vascularization in DAT and inducing adipo-
cyte regeneration. The experimental results show that SVF-EVs has the potential to be an option to address the 
vascularization deficit.
SVF has been shown in many studies to have a pro-vascularizing and thus fat regenerating  effect45,46. Zhong 
et al.45 mixed SVF with free adipose tissue and then autografted it to increase adipocyte survival and regenera-
tion rates. Lu and his colleagues prepared SVF into SVF-gel to achieve better restorative results in facial contour 
remodeling and  rejuvenation46. In this paper, we prepared SVF in the form of nanovesicles and investigated its 
effect on promoting the revascularization of the acellular matrix, enriching the ways SVF can be applied, thereby 
increasing the time interval for SVF to maintain its biological effect after derived from adipose tissue. Through 
in vitro experiments, we found that SVF prepared in vesicle form promotes adipocyte formation and enhance 
vascular endothelial cell migration biological effects, and we hypothesize that these are closely related to the 
protein encapsulated in the vesicles. The transcription factor, PPARγ, plays a key role in adipocyte formation, 
and pro-adipocytes initiate lipogenic differentiation in response to PPARγ, with increased expression of intra-
cellular fatty acid synthase (FAS), becoming mature adipocytes and secreting representative hormones such as 
a diponectin47,48. Ang-1 promotes endothelial cell outgrowth and migration, and VEGF promotes endothelial

cell proliferation and the formation of lumen structures, which play an important role in the revascularization of 
the acellular  matrix49. In our study, western blot detected these key lipogenic and angiogenic-associated growth 
factors in vesicles. Meanwhile, some miRNAs, lncRNAs, and other nucleic acids have been shown to regulate 
adipogenesis and angiogenesis, and engineered vesicles may also be encapsulated with these molecules, and this 
aspect is worth further  investigation50.
After migration of endothelial cells into the acellular matrix, the cell morphology gradually forms vacuole, 
and multiple endothelial cells together form a lumen, with branching and remodeling, eventually forming a 
vascular n etwork51. During this angiogenic process, the vascular lumen diameter gradually increases, and the 
structure of the formed lumen becomes more  stable52. We performed CD31 immunofluorescence staining of 
grafts harvested from the animal study and showed that the central region of the graft in the SVF vesicle group 
showed relatively large tubular neovascularization at eight weeks, whereas only a small cellular vacuole formed 
inside the control group, and demonstrated a more stable, mature neovascular network formed inside the DAT 
in the SVF vesicle group. This is consistent with the results of in vitro experiments that SVF vesicles have a pro-
angiogenic biological effect and promote revascularization of the acellular matrix.
ADSCs are adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into osteo-
genesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis but require the addition of induction factors to differentiate in a spe-
cific direction when cultured in vitro28. In this study, ADSCs were cultured with complete medium supplemented 
with 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs or not for 7 and 14 days. Particularly, ADSCs co-cultured without SVF-EVs had no 
intracellular lipid droplet formation after 14 days of culture, which is consistent with the fact that adipogenic 
differentiation of ADSCs requires the addition of adipogenic inducers like dexamethasone, insulin, and indo-
methacin in the culture medium. This results reminded us that SVF-EVs can induce adipogenic differentiation 
of ADSCs in vitro.
The metabolic processes of lipid storage and lipolysis of adipocyte require high oxygen  consumption53. Hence, 
the rich vascular network within the adipose tissue and the degree of re-vascularization after autologous fat graft-
ing has an important impact on volume  retention42,54. The DAT contains more cytokines that promote adipose 
tissue formation and is more conducive to adipose tissue regeneration than other t issues54. Histological staining 
such as HE, Masson, and Oil Red O staining showed that the DAT lost the inherent adipocytes and vascular 
structures of adipose tissue, retaining only the loosely arranged extracellular matrix and luminal structures. In 
this study, DAT was transplanted into the subcutaneous of nude mice, and volume retention of the acellular 
matrix was maintained at more than 60% after four weeks. After eight weeks of transplantation, volume reten-
tion declined to approximately 20%, and the addition of SVF-EVs to promote revascularization of the acellular 
matrix was maintained at 30%. We suggest that the low volume retention of grafts after transplantation is related

to the relatively sparse nature of the DAT but the low tissue elastic modulus facilitates regeneration of adipose 
tissue in the acellular matrix.
The SVF-EVs were observed to possess the biological activity of promoting neovascularization and adi-
pocyte regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but there still exist limitations in this research and characteristics of 
SVF-EVs worth further exploration. Limited number of samples may make the results less convincing and the 
accuracy affected. Moreover, no significant differences between 0 and 40 ng/mL SVF-EVs group was observed 
on histological images at 4 weeks, which not enough to show the SVF-EVs’ efficacy in promoting angiogenesis 
and adipogenesis. In addition, when we explored the contents of SVF-EVs, no quantitative method (like ELISA) 
was performed to quantify the proteins in the whole vesicle, which limited the interpretation of the mechanism 
related to SVF-EVs’ effect on promoting adipocyte regeneration and neovascularization in this study. We hold 
that this paper explores the feasibility of direct preparation of vesicles from biological tissues, namely SVF, and 
preliminary study of the effect of SVF-EVs on cell behavior. And further studies are needed to clarify the mecha-
nism of growth factors action and promote the wide application of engineered nanovesicles.
Conclusion
In summary, the engineered vesicle made from SVF demonstrated accelerating endothelial cell migration and 
promoting ADSC lipogenic differentiation in vitro. After transplanting for 8 weeks, more angiogenesis in the 
central region of the implant was observed using DAT grafting in conjunction with SVF-EVs. Our findings sug-
gest that SVF-EVs can promote vascularization of acellular matrix and that the associated physical preparation 
for processing biological samples is feasible.
