method as well as the discussion and results of the establishment of the FDA 
and the 21st Century Cures Act. Results: On December 13, 2016, H.R.34—114th 
United States Congress (2015-2016) 21st Century CURES Act was signed into 
law by President Barack H. Obama which included the Serious or Life- 
threatening indication to be written into the CURES Act. In summary, the 21st 
Century Cures Act is a landmark piece of legislation that enjoyed broad bipar-
tisan support in United States Congress. The main goals of the Act are im-
pactful and should transform future cancer, neurologic, and precision medi-
cine or drug research as well as aid individuals with mental health is intended 
to facilitate the prompt approval of new agents and devices, clinicians should 
be aware of the types of data behind an approval and take this into considera-
tion when developing illnesses and opioid dependence. However, some of the 
wording within the CURES Act regarding the drug and device approval 
process may bring pause to health care providers including pharmacists. Al-
though this wording and implementing care plans and counseling patients. 
The 21st Century Cures Act was incorporated into laws and regulations by the 
FDA under § 3072 of the Act grants the Commissioner of Food and Drugs the 
authority to appoint and set the annual rate of pay for outstanding and quali-
fied candidates to scientific, technical, or professional positions that support 
the development, review, and regulation of medical products.

1. Introduction 
The use of Golden Sunrise’s new medical Technology and Innovation in applica-
tion first began as an emergency use designation under the FDA Guidance for 
the Industry “Emergency Use of a Test Article” under FDA regulations Title 21 
C.F.R. § 56.104(c) [1]; allows, the use of a test article on a human subject in a 
life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable treatment is available, 
and which there is not sufficient time to obtain Institutional Review Board ap-
proval [2]. The new medical Technology and Innovation were used with the 
emergency standard in mind. When in a licensed doctor’s care, the medical pro-
fessional could invoke the “Emergency Use of a Test Article” criteria which al-
low a five day treatment with the Institutional Review Board or Advisory Com-
mittee involvement [3]. The physician/doctor standard was a successful way of 
using unapproved products when patients were in a life-threatening situation. 
This standard did not have a Serious or Life-threatening condition or disease yet 
established as an indication [4]. Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise seeing the 
benefit to the patient with serious illness then requested that the FDA petition 
the United States Congress to pass legislation that would designate the Serious or 
Life-threatening conditions or diseases as an indication that doctors could

use for their patients without the continuous need for the Institutional Review 
Board or Advisory Committee oversight and a restriction of five days for treat-
ment [5]. 
Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise requested consideration for a new indica-
tion of Serious or Life-threatening conditions or disease and for new legislation 
to the FDA on November 24, 2009 through August 08, 2015 [6]. 
2. FDA Regulatory Method 
Emergency use is not considered “Research” under the Department of Health 
and Human Services regulation and such emergency use is not considered “Re-
search” as covered under Title 45 C.F.R. Part 46—Protection of Human Subjects 
[7]. The law was set down by the FDA for “Emergency Use of a Test Article” to 
be administered on a human subject in a life-threatening situation in which no 
standard acceptable treatment is available, and in which there is not sufficient 
time to obtain an Institutional Review Board or Advisory Committee approval 
or acceptance. This may provide benefits to a patient in a life-threatening situa-
tion for that time but it becomes a problem for the sponsor/manufacturer to 
carry out on a case-by-case basis and for the doctor or medical professional to 
provide proper treatment for patients in Serious or Life-threatening conditions 
or diseases. It is also required that consent be given by the patient though, many 
patients are not coherent in a life-threatening situation and family members may 
be apprehensive to allow other treatments. Huu S. TIEU seeing that the patient 
was not being fairly allowed new therapeutic treatments available to them re-
quested the FDA petition the United States Congress to make a law and regula-
tion that would allow Serious or Life-threatening conditions or diseases to be-
come an indication so that the doctor could treat a patient more readily and 
provide the patient all treatments available to benefit a serious illness situation. 
The CURES Act also addresses the opioid crisis and allows for the improvement 
of mental health services [8]. 
3. FDA Established 21st Century Cures Act Discussion and   
Results 
In Year-2015 the FDA requested that United States Congress create laws and 
regulations concerning issues that had come to light of the flaws and needs that 
existed concerning new medical Technology and Innovation or new drug prod-
ucts and their need to make it to the market faster than the existing FDA path-
way methods at the time of the request. In this request, the FDA included the 
category and indication of Serious or Life-threatening conditions or diseases. 
This is part of what is now known as the 21st Century CURES Act and was re-
quested by Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical from August 20, 
2008, through August 08, 2015. In the request, Huu S. TIEU asked the FDA for 
Serious or Life-threatening conditions or diseases to be considered as an indica-
tion. The United States Congress established the CURES Act as an Expedited

Review Prioritized [9]; Fast Track designation [10], Accelerate Approval desig-
nation [11], Breakthrough Therapy designation [12], and Priority Review pro-
gram [13] pathway that would have approval of an “Application to Market a 
New or Abbreviation New Drug or Biologic for Human Use” in a short period of 
time (as short as sixty-days) if the drug was shown to be safe and effective, the 
CURES Act allows sponsors/manufactures to provide “Real-World Evidence” 
[14] [15], “Medical Billing” [16], “Data Summaries,” [17], and “Predict Clinical 
Benefit” [18]. The United States Congress finished and established the new law 
called the 21st Century Cures Act and it was signed by President Barrack H. 
Obama on December 13, 2016 [19]. On January 02, 2017, the FDA received five 
hundred million (US$500000000.00) dollars to implement the program and es-
tablished the FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy division [20] to 
speed the evaluation and review of cell therapies, regenerative medicine, biolog-
ics products, or any combination product using such therapies or products if it 
“is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure Serious or Life-threatening condi-
tions or diseases. 
Accelerated Approval; Traditional approval requires that clinical benefit be 
shown before approval can be granted. Accelerated approval is given to some 
new drugs for Serious and Life-threatening illnesses that lack satisfactory treat-
ments. This allows a New Drug Application (NDA) to be approved before 
measures of effectiveness that would usually be required for approval are availa-
ble [21]. 
Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical, Inc. requested the United 
States FDA for an indication for serious illnesses. The FDA requested the United 
States Congress to create laws and regulations for a new medical indication of 
Serious or Life-threatening conditions or diseases (Figure 1).

The implementation of this set of laws and regulations was believed to benefit 
public health for the almost immediate access to new medical Technology and 
Innovation. New drug products that would not be available otherwise for the 
treatment of therapeutic proteins [22] or the therapeutic biologics [23] products 
treatment of patients would not be allowed without access to needed alternatives 
for drugs and therapies that may improve the outcomes of patients that have 
exhausted other human prescription drug products or therapies. The only alter-
native over time would be DEATH. Patients with serious illnesses, manufactur-
ers, hospitals, and doctors would also benefit from this set of laws and regula-
tions as in the previous designation for use of a drug product in a Serious or 
Life-threatening  situation the manufacturer could  only provide one  sample 
“Emergency Use of a Test Article” patient for five days which is difficult and 
prohibitive to distribute and monitor as it makes the manufacturer to only pro-
duce one drug sample under Title 21 C.F.R. Part 56.104(c) and for the physician/ 
doctor to only use the drug product up to five days. The 21st Century CURES Act 
establishes that a Serious or Life-threatening condition or disease is considered 
an indication and may be treated then billed to the United States Center for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services and other private insurance [24]. The FDA did 
not benefit from this new set of laws and regulations because under the Serious 
or Life-threatening conditions or diseases designation, the pathway of approval 
through the clinical trials was not required as it is considered unethical to use a 
randomized double blind placebo studies where over half of the test group could 
die from lack of proper treatment, as would be the case in a Serious or Life- 
threatening situation for which there is established effective therapy [25]. 
On February 16, 2017, Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise requested the FDA 
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy for a Breakthrough Therapy designa-
tion, this designation would treat patients with Serious or Life-threatening con-
ditions or diseases from the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy division, 
Golden Sunrise had an FDA New Drug Application No.: 204701 and National 
Drug Code Directory No. 70642-001-01 [26]. 1) During this process discussions 
took place between Huu S. TIEU, Golden Sunrise, and the Regenerative Medi-
cine Advanced Therapy division. On March 25, 2019, Golden Sunrise received 
the FDA Inspection Report and Establishment Identifier No.: 3012327979 [27]. 
After the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy division designation was 
applied to ImunStem product, the Golden Sunrise documents were then moved 
forward to the Product Jurisdiction Officer on August 27, 2019. After all docu-
ments were reviewed and accepted, the Golden Sunrise product was classified as 
FDA-Regulated Medical Product and met the requirements for acceptance under 
the FDA Significant Scientific Agreement standards. 2) During the Coronavirus 
pandemic in January 2020 the FDA created the FDA Coronavirus Treatment 
Acceleration Program division on March 30, 2020, to address the COVID-19 
pandemic. Huu S. TIEU and Golden Sunrise applied and submitted a cover let-
ter for the FDA Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program division with the 
indicated treatment for COVID-19 and Serious or Life-threatening conditions or

diseases on April 03, 2020. On September 15, 2020, after submitting patient 
medical report results for COVID-19 under the Priority Review Expedited No.: 
2020-2867 CR2020-2596 to the FDA Industry for Biologics department. The 
FDA Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program division moved the Golden 
Sunrise documents forward to the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-
search department and FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research de-
partment for review and evaluation. After the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation 
and Research department and FDA Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research 
department reviewed and evaluated the patient medical report results (Real-World 
Evidence) the submission moved forward to the FDA Product Jurisdiction Of-
ficer department and it was designated Golden Sunrise products and Plans of 
Care as FDA-Regulated Medical Products, which was established in the FDA 
Pharmacy department [28]. On November 13, 2020, United States Center for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services and other private insurance agreed with value 
payment to Golden Sunrise treatment under procedure code—Cellular Therapy 
M0075. 
4. Conclusion 
Huu S. TIEU submitted a cover letter on November 24, 2009, which requested 
the FDA to review and evaluate Golden Sunrise Pharmaceutical products for a 
new indication of Serious or Life-threatening conditions or diseases without 
randomized double blind placebo studies. After the United States Congress 
created the 21st Century CURES Act (Public Law 114-255) “Passed the House of 
Representatives on November 30th, 2016 with a vote of 392-26 and passed the 
Senate on December 7th, 2016 with a vote of 94-5 signed into law by President 
Barack H. Obama on December 13th, 2016”. This law covers Serious or life- 
threatening conditions or diseases as a new indication.
