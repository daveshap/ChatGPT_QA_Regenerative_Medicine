28  Abstract  
29  Protein  kinase  CK2  activity  is  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  various  hematological 
30  malignancies like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that remains challenging concerning 
31  treatment. Consequently, here we used Illumina HT-12 microarray gene RNA expression 
32  profiling to study the molecular events that might support the anti-leukemic effect of CIGB-
33  300 peptide which targets both CK2 substrates and the CK2α catalytic subunits on HL-60 and 
34  OCI-AML3 cell lines. As a result, 185 and 812 genes appeared significantly modulated in HL-
35  60 cells at 30 min and 3 h of incubation with CIGB-300 for p< 0.01 and FC>│1.5│, 
36  respectively; while 222 and 332 genes appeared modulated in OCI-AML3 cells. Importantly, 
37  functional  enrichment  analysis  evidenced  that  genes  and  transcription  factors  related  to 
38  apoptosis, cell cycle, leukocyte differentiation, signaling by cytokines/interleukins, and NF-
39  kB, TNF signaling pathways were significantly represented in AML cells transcriptomic 
40  profiles. The influence of CIGB-300 on these biological processes and pathways is dependent 
41  on the cellular background, in first place, and treatment duration. Of note, the impact of the 
42  peptide on NF-kB signaling was corroborated by the quantification of selected NF-kB target 
43  genes, as well as the measurement of p50 binding activity and soluble TNF-α induction. 
44  Quantification  of  CSF1/M-CSF  and  CDKN1A/P21  by  PCR  supports  peptide  effects  on 
45  differentiation and cell cycle. Overall, here we explore for the first time the temporal dynamics 
46  of the gene expression profile regulated by CIGB-300 and provide fresh molecular clues 
47  concerning the antineoplastic effect of CIGB-300 in two relevant AML backgrounds. 
48  1. Introduction 
49  Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by 
50  high proliferation and ≥ 20% of undifferentiated myeloid progenitor cells (blasts) in bone 
51  marrow or peripheral blood [1], representing the most common acute leukemia in adults [2].  
52  AML, among the  most  aggressive and lethal types of cancer,  is often characterized  by 
53  resistance  to  standard  chemotherapy  and  poor  long-term  outcomes,  in  part  due  to  the 
54  chromosomal  alterations  and  gene  mutations  frequently  found  in  leukemic  blasts  [3]. 
55  Technological advances have led to a remarkable improvement in our understanding of cancer 
56  through the implementation of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses [4, 
57  5]. Several studies have demonstrated the use of gene differential expressions as effective tools 
58  for risk stratification of AML patients [6-9] or drug sensitivity [10]. Microarray technology has 
59  contributed to a better classification of acute leukemias [8, 11-14]. The value of microarray

60  technology was earlier demonstrated to classify acute leukemia in myeloid and lymphoid [15]. 
61  Later on, microarray permitted the recognition of molecular subtypes in ALL patients [16]. 
62  This technology has also been used in the diagnosis and prognosis of AML as well as in the 
63  study of mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapeutics action in this disease [17].  
64  Despite the progress in understanding AML biology and the use of novel technologies to 
65  improve disease characterization, chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant are still 
66  the principal treatment approach for AML. Therapies targeting recurrent genetic mutations 
67  have been also gaining importance but less explored have been targeting leukemia cells with 
68  no mutations [18]. FDA has recently approved several non-cytostatic agents for the treatment 
69  of the patient, targeting important pathways in AML [19]. Nevertheless, there is a need for 
70  novel agents to combine with standard chemotherapy to efficiently eliminate leukemic cells 
71  and improve the outcomes. 
72  Protein kinase CK2 hyperactivity is implicated in the pathogenesis of several hematological 
73  malignancies; high levels of CK2 appeared as a common denominator in all hematologic 
74  neoplasms, suggesting that CK2 inhibition could represent an attractive molecular target in 
75  AML  [20,  21].  Only  two  compounds,  the  ATP-competitive  inhibitor  CX-4945,  and  the 
76  synthetic-peptide CIGB-300 have advanced to a clinical setting [3, 22]. CIGB-300 is a peptide 
77  originally  designed  to  block  the  CK2-mediated  phosphorylation  through  binding  to  the 
78  phosphoacceptor domain in the substrates [23]. However, recent studies have demonstrated that 
79  this inhibitor can interact with the CK2α catalytic subunit and regulate part of the CK2-
80  dependent  phosphoproteome  in  AML  cell  lines  [21].  Additionally,  proteomic  analysis 
81  supported previous results evidencing that the pro-apoptotic effect, the impact over the cell 
82  cycle, the redox regulation, and the modulation of transcriptional/ translational processes are 
83  common  denominators  for  CIGB-300-mediated  CK2  inhibition  in  AML  cells  [21,  24]. 
84  However, a comprehensive characterization of the gene profile on CIGB-300-treated AML 
85  cells helping to understand its antileukemic effect, has not been accomplished yet.  
86  Using  microarray  approach,  here  we  interrogated  the  temporal  gene  expression  profile 
87  modulated for CIGB-300 on HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cell lines uncovering key molecular events 
88  that might support the antileukemic effect of this CK2 peptide inhibitor.

92  Human AML cell lines HL-60 and OCI-AML3 were originally obtained from the American 
93  Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VA, USA) and the German Collection of Microorganisms 
94  and  Cell  Cultures  (DSMZ,  Braunschweig,  Germany),  respectively.  Both  cell  lines  were 
95  cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal 
96  bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Sigma, MO, USA) under 
97  standard cell culture conditions at 37 ºC and 5% CO2. 
98  Experiment setting up 
99  An experiment with three replicates per condition of both cell lines was designed. The eight 
100  groups included untreated cells at 30min and 3h and treatment with 40M of CIGB-300 peptide 
101  for  30min  and  3h.  After  incubations  cells  were  pickup  in  buffer  RLT  with  1%  of  β-
102  mercaptoethanol and total RNA purification proceeded following the instructions of RNeasy 
103  Plus  mini  kit  (Qiagen,  USA).  Quality  control  of  total  RNA  was  carried  out  by 
104  spectrophotometric readings of optic density (OD) at 260 and 280nm in Nanodrop 1000 
105  (ThermoFisher, USA) to determine the concentration (> 80ng/µL) and OD260/280 ratio (1.8-
106  2.2). Additionally, RIN (7-10) was calculated by capillary electrophoresis in a Bioanalyzer 
107  (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). 
108  Gene expression profile by Microarray 
109  2.5 µg (100 ng/µL) of each total RNA sample was sent to McGill University and Génome 
110  Québec Innovation Centre (Montréal, Québec, Canada) for the experiment in Affymetrix 
111  Clariom S microarray gene expression platform.   
112  Quantitative PCR amplification 
113  We obtained cDNA in 20 µL, from 870 ng of total RNA of three samples per group, following 
114  the instructions of the manufacturer of Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, 
115  Germany). qPCR reactions were set up in 20 µL with 300 nM of oligonucleotides (Table S1) 
116  and LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master 2x (Roche, Germany) using three technical 
117  replicates per sample. The runs were carried out in a LightCycler®480II (Roche, Germany) 
118  equipment using the standard program SYBR Green Probe II and controls [25]. Ct and 
119  efficiency values were obtained and used in REST 2009[26] to report a Change Factor in gene 
120  levels after the treatment for 30min and 3h with CIGB-300, in relation to untreated cells after 
121  the normalization with GAPDH, DDX5, and ABL1 as reference genes [25]. The program

122  reports a p-value after a Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomization Test [27], reporting 
123  increasing and decreasing gene levels as UP and DOWN, respectively. 
124  Basic Microarray Data Analysis provided by the Genome Québec Innovation Centre 
125  Basic bioinformatics analysis of microarray experiment was performed as a custom service at 
126  McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre (Montréal, Canada). This service 
127  included quality control, preprocessing, and exploratory and differential expression analysis. 
128  As a result of the quality control, the array corresponding to replicate 1 of the OCI-AML3 
129  control cell at 30min (O-30minC-1) was removed from the analysis. Preprocessing included 
130  the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method [28] that performs background adjustment 
131  using  the  RMA  convolution  model,  followed  by  quantile  normalization  and  log2 
132  transformation. Probes belonging to the same gene are then averaged using a robust model that 
133  estimates probe-specific effects using all arrays. Technical replicate arrays were averaged 
134  within the groups defined by variable(s) SampleID. The exploratory analysis applied clustering 
135  and dimensionality reduction techniques to the expression profiles in a hypothesis-free manner 
136  such as hierarchical clustering based on the correlation distance, 2D Multidimensional scaling 
137  plot (MDS), and ANOVA R2 of covariates on the first Principal Components. 
138  For  differential  expression  analysis,  the  Bioconductor  Limma  package  was  used  [29]. 
139  Statistical tests contrasting different treatments were performed (Moderated t-tests)[30]. The 
140  Benjamini-Hochberg was used for FDR estimation [31].  
141  Additional Bioinformatics Analysis 
142  Genes with a fold change (FC) greater than [1.5] and p values lesser than 0.01 (p< 0.01), in 
143  each cell line at each time compared with the untreated control, were considered Differentially 
144  Expressed Genes (DEGs) and used for later bioinformatics analysis.  Venn diagram was 
145  constructed to show common and different genes (VIB /UGent Bioinformatics & Evolutionary 
146  Genomics Gent, Belgic; http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). 
147  Clustergrammer online tool was used to generate unsupervised heatmaps from the most 
148  differentially  expressed  1100  genes  [32].    Enrichr  online  analysis  associated  with 
149  Clustergrammer was used for enrichment exploration of the top 100 genes and other lists [33]. 
150  Additional  functional  enrichment  analyses  were  carried  out  with  the  bioinformatic  tool 
151  Metascape [34]. Metascape gene annotation and analysis resource (https://metascape.org/), is 
152  a web-based tool that computes the accumulative hypergeometric distribution and enrichment

153  factors to identify significantly enriched biological processes through statistical analysis (p-
154  value<0.01, enrichment factor >1.5)). 
155  BisoGenet (version 3.0.0) Cytoscape plugin available from Cytoscape Application Manager, 
156  was used to generate PPI networks [36]. Cytoscape software (v.3.3.0) was used as a network 
157  framework [37]. Analysis on-networks to predict transcription factors (TF) from DEGs was 
158  carried out with the iRegulon plugin (version 1.3) [38]. Highly interconnected genes on the 
159  network were explored with the MCODE plugin (version 1.4.1) [39].   
160  P50-DNA binding activity detection by ELISA 
161  To measure p50-DNA binding activity HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells were incubated with 
162  CIGB-300 at a dose of 40 µM for 30 min, 2 h, and 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After treatment, 
163  cells were collected and nuclear extraction was performed using a Panomics kit (#EK110). The 
164  DNA-binding activity of the p50 NF-kB subunit was monitored using a commercially available 
165  ELISA-based assay (Panomics, #EK1111). Briefly, nuclear samples (10 µg) were incubated in 
166  an ELISA plate that was coated with oligonucleotides containing a p50 consensus regulatory 
167  element sequence. The positive control nuclear extract was prepared from HEK293 cells that 
168  were treated with 20ng/mL of TNF-α for 30 min. The wells were washed and exposed to a 
169  primary antibody specific for the p50 subunit of NF-kB. The binding of the primary antibody 
170  to protein was detected through a chromogenic reaction involving the enzymatic breakdown of 
171  3, 3’, 5, 5’ tetramethylbenzidine via a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate secondary 
172  antibody. Finally, absorbance at 450nm was read using a CLARIOstar® high-performance 
173  monochromator multimode microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany).         
174  TNF-α secretion detection by ELISA 
175  To evaluate TNF-α secretion we employed a commercial human TNF-α ELISA kit (R&D 
176  Systems). HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 500000 cells /mL in 
177  12-well cell culture plates and treated with CIGB-300 (40 µM) for 3 h and 24 h at 37 °C in 5% 
178  CO2. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) at a dose of 2.5 ng/mL was used as a positive control of 
179  TNF-α induction for 24 h of treatment. After incubation, supernatants were collected and 
180  subjected to ELISA analysis.

183  Firstly, different diagnostic methods were used to sense microarray results (Figure S1). A 
184  hierarchical clustering based on the correlation distance is shown in Figure S1A. This one-
185  dimensional clustering separates samples into experimental groups firstly based on cell line 
186  and later based on the treatment time and treatment received. Replicate 1 of the sample from 
187  OCI-AML3 at 30min (O-30min-1) was excluded from the analysis as it is an outlier. The 
188  analysis  of  ANOVA  R2  of  covariates  on  the  first  Principal  Components  showed  main 
189  differences in the first components (PC1, PC2) come from cell lines differences; treatment (in 
190  PC3) and time (30min or 3h, in PC4) govern the differences in the other components (Figure 
191  S1B). The separation among the eight groups of this experiment in a homogeneous way is 
192  shown through Multidimensional Scaling plotting (Figure S1C). All these methods show the 
193  homogeneity of the data per group, the proper separation among them, and the main and ranked 
194  sources of variabilities of this microarray experiment.   
195  The number of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) obtained in each comparison, for a FC 
196  >[1.5] and a p< 0.01 are shown in Figure 1A. As a result, in HL-60 cells, 185 and 812 genes 
197  were identified as significantly modulated at 30 min and 3 h, while in OCI-AML3 cells, 222 
198  and  332  genes  appeared  differentially  modulated  in  response  to  CIGB-300  treatment. 
199  Interestingly, the numbers of genes up-regulated are always higher than down-regulated. HL-
200  60 showed a much higher number of regulated genes after 3h of treatment. 
201  Subsequently, a Venn diagram was constructed to show common and different genes (Figure 
202  1B). Only 21 genes are shared in the four comparison groups, most of them are transcription 
203  factors (EGR1/2/3, FOS, FOSB, IER3, JUN, JUNB, NR4A1/2/3, TNF, ZFP36) or chemokines 
204  CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL8/IL8. It points to the recruitment of a rapid response to stress and 
205  inflammation to deal with the peptide effect.  
206  An unsupervised Heatmap from the most differentially expressed 1100 genes using the online 
207  tool Clustergrammer showed very well-delimited clusters (Figure 2A).  On top, there is a 
208  Cluster containing genes that increased their expression in both cell lines and time points 
209  (Cluster I) although with different kinetics and magnitudes.  Heatmap of the top 100 up-
210  regulated genes in Cluster I showed those common genes, biological pathways, and processes 
211  (Figures S2A and B). Even when the changes are more pronounced in HL-60 after 3h of 
212  treatments, it is interesting to note among the GO terms those related to cytokine-mediated 
213  signaling pathway, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, and inflammatory response sharing 
214  genes as CXCL10, TFN, IL1B, and other transcription factors, also included in positive

215  regulation of transcription, and chemokines that participate in the Regulation of inflammatory 
216  response (Figure 2B).  The main pathways are related to TNF and IL-17, TLR, NF-kB 
217  signaling,  Cytokine-cytokine  receptor  interaction,  and  C-type  lectin  receptor  signaling 
218  pathways (Figure S2B).  
219  Clusters II and III show interesting behaviors related to cell lines background (Figure 2A), 
220  where genes decreased their expression in HL-60 at 3h but increased in OCI-AML3 and vice 
221  versa. Enrichment analysis using the Enrichr tool associated with Clustergrammer showed 
222  different biological processes containing those genes. While 3h after peptide treatment of HL-
223  60 (Figure 2D), CIGB-300 decreased the expression of 232 genes mostly related to signaling 
224  transduction through Ras and Rho proteins and phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled 
225  receptor, the 98 genes that decreased expression in OCI-AML3 (Figure 2C) are mainly related 
226  to other biological processes as regulation of dendrite development, transcription, protein 
227  retention in Golgi, glucose import or leukocyte mediated immunity regulation.  
228  3.2 Enrichment analysis of DEGs pointed to cell line and timing dependence  
229  When enriched biological processes were analyzed on each cell line per time of treatment, we 
230  obtained the Metascape pictures shown in Figure 3. Since 30 min of treatment in HL-60, there 
231  were genes from the NGF-stimulated transcription process, including transcription factors 
232  (EGR1/2/3/4, FOS, FOSB, JUN, SRF, NR4A1/2/3), and chemokines CCL2 & CXCL8.  In 
233  both cell lines, the PID NFAT Transcription factor pathway is enriched which included similar 
234  14 TF and chemokines genes together with TNF and additional 18 and 37 genes in HL-60 and 
235  OCI-AML3, respectively. Regulation of hemopoiesis and differentiation are also represented 
236  in both cell lines. The first process appeared for HL-60 (30 min and 3h) and OCI-AML3 (30 
237  min); the second one was for HL-60 30 min and OCI-AML3 3h. The orexin receptor pathway 
238  is enriched in OCI-AML3 at 30 min and 3h, but only later at 3h in HL-60.  
239  Of note, the cellular response to TNF, NF-kB signaling pathway and Signaling by GPCR are 
240  processes highly enriched in HL-60 treated for 30min with CIGB-300. After 3h of treatment 
241  the inflammatory response, IL-18 signaling pathway, and chemotaxis appeared as highly 
242  enriched processes in HL-60, together with TNF signaling pathway, signaling by GPCR 
243  regulation of protein kinase activity and positive regulation of cell death or Death Receptor 
244  Signaling. These last processes included genes as BCL2L11, CDKN1A, FAS, GADD45B, 
245  MAP3K5, SQSTM1 and TNFRSF12A.

246  In contrast, in OCI-AML3, IL10 and IL4/IL13 signaling appeared enriched at 30 min and 3h, 
247  respectively. At the earlier time, it showed the negative regulation of the cell cycle as an 
248  enhanced process.  
249  3.3 DEGs show high functional network connections 
250  Using Cytoscape as a framework, we investigated the network connection among genes in each 
251  cell line, also considering their expression kinetics (Figure 4).  
252  In HL-60 cells, 305 out of 915 genes were connected in functional networks (Figure 4A). Most 
253  of the genes were regulated after 3h of treatment and 30 of them were regulated at both time 
254  points. The majority of these genes regulated along the experiment were transcription factors; 
255  additional TF highly connected are black lines surrounded in the net.  The most interconnected 
256  modules included TF as EGR1, JUN, JUNB, FOS, FOSB, NF-kB family members, RUNX1, 
257  TNF, and genes connected to signaling for apoptosis and cell cycle control, such as FAS and 
258  CDKN1A. On the other side, DEGs in OCI-AML3 were less connected in networks. Figure 
259  4B shows the main modules obtained with 42 out of 431 genes. Here, we also found highly 
260  connection among TF EGR1, JUN, JUNB, FOS, and FOSB but mainly at 30 min post- CIGB-
261  300  treatment.  TNF,  regulated  along  all  the experiment,  connect  with  NF-KB  regulator 
262  NFKBIA and with genes connected to signaling for apoptosis and cell cycle control as PPARG, 
263  GADD45B, and CDKN1A (p21). P21 is also connected to Vimentin (VIM), which is also 
264  regulated throughout the experiment.  
265  3.4 Transcription factor prediction from DEGs shows differential dynamics in both AML cell

268  CIGB-300 treatment for 30 min and 3h, we explored gene regulatory motifs from DEGs 
269  networks using the iRegulon application. In Figure 5 we show two graphs with ordered TF 
270  according to the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) per cell line and time point. A high NES 
271  score (≥3.0) indicates a motif that recovers a large proportion of the input genes within the top 
272  of its ranking.  
273  In HL-60, gene transcription regulation is governed at 30 min by SRF, NF-kB family members 
274  (RELA, NFKB1), JUN, CREB1, MEF2A/C, TBP, and EGR 4/2/3; later at 3h, BCL3 gains 
275  importance together with NF-kB family members (RELA, NFKB1 and 2, REL), FOS, TBP, 
276  JUN, and JUNB. Otherwise, in OCI-AML3 the 30 min gene regulation is mainly accomplished

277  by TBP, SRF, EGR2/1/4, MEF2A/C/B, RELA, NFKB2, MAPK14, JUND, and CREB1 while 
278  at 3h post-treatment the gene regulation strategy completely changed with a role for DBP, HLF, 
279  ATF2, TEF, CEBPA/B, NFIL3, and GATA2 and not by NF-kB family members or AP-1 
280  complex components.  
281  3.5 CIGB-300 stimulates cellular differentiation and cell cycle target genes  
282  Myeloid  hematopoietic  differentiation  is  controlled  by  extrinsic  cytokines  and  intrinsic 
283  transcription factors such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, encoded by 
284  CSF1) and EGR1. Both were studied by qPCR (Figure S3), showing an increase of the TF 
285  EGR1 in all conditions but mainly in HL-60 treated for 30min. CSF1 was significantly 
286  increased after 3h of HL-60 treatment with CIGB-300.  
287  We also explored gene expression of CDKN1A/P21, with important regulator roles in G1 
288  progression in cell cycle, by qPCR in both cell lines after the CIGB-300 treatment for 30 min, 
289  2 h and 8 h. Figure S4 shows the increase of CDKN1A mRNA levels in both cell lines; from 
290  30 min in OCI-AML3 and after 2 h and 8 h of CIGB-300 treatment in HL-60 with higher 
291  magnitudes.  
292  3.6 CIGB-300 elicits up-regulation of TNFA and NF-kB target genes  
293  NF-kB pathway genes were shown to be significantly up-regulated by CIGB-300. To assess 
294  the robustness of the microarray analysis, we selected representative genes for validation by 
295  quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) and ELISA. Ten genes from the NF-kB signaling 
296  pathway, identified by the high-throughput analysis in HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells treated 
297  with CIGB-300 in a temporal serial at 30 min and 3 h, were investigated by qPCR (Figure 6). 
298  The expression patterns obtained by PCR confirmed microarray results, in a cell-line and 
299  temporal manner, with higher absolute up-regulation fold changes values in relation to those 
300  in the microarray.  
301  Target genes NFKBIA/IKBα, NFKB1/p50, NFKB2/p52, and TNFAIP3/A20 showed little or 
302  no over-expression early (30 minutes) but at 3 h they significantly increased expression in both 
303  cell lines. These increased levels were higher in the HL-60 cell line compared to OCI-AML3. 
304  c-REL/REL showed this same behavior in HL-60.  In contrast, RELA gene levels were not 
305  significantly modulated by CIGB-300 in the microarray and qPCR analysis, neither the c-REL 
306  & RELA target BCL2L11. Moreover, c-REL targets MAP3K8 and GADD45B increased gene 
307  expressions either in HL-60 (30min) or in OCI-AML3 (30min and 3h), respectively.

308  In agreement with the qPCR result, a clear increase of the p50 binding activity after CIGB-300 
309  treatment was confirmed by ELISA assay in both AML cell lines; although a higher level of 
310  p50 DNA binding was observed in OCI-AML3 cells compared to HL-60 (Figure 7A).  
311  qPCR results also evidenced TNFA(TNF-α) was up-regulated by CIGB-300 3.8- fold in OCI-
312  AML3 and 11.6- fold in HL-60 as early as 30 minutes of drug exposure. This up-regulation 
313  was still found at 3h (1.7-fold for OCI-AML3 and 10.6-fold for HL-60). An ELISA assay to 
314  measure TNF-α secretion in AML cell lines following CIGB-300 treatment corroborated 
315  microarray  and  qPCR  data  showing  a  cell  line-specific  regulation  with  elevated  TNF-α 
316  expression in HL-60 (66.7 pg/mL) compared to OCI-AML3 (10.3 pg/mL) at 3 h of treatment 
317  (Figure 7B). TNF-α induction by CIGB-300 tends to decrease at 24 h post-treatment, pointing 
318  to the time-dependent effect of this signaling pathway activation.   
319  4. Discussion 
320  AML is still a challenging disease in terms of effective therapy and minimal residual disease 
321  control [40], thus novel therapeutics have evolved in the last years, where CK2 targeting looks 
322  among the most promising ones [20, 41, 42]. Preclinical results have shown CIGB-300 peptide 
323  impacts on leukemic cell proliferation [21]. Preliminary clinical results show safety and first 
324  insights into the effect on AML patients [43].  
325  In vitro models are often used to understand the cellular response, molecular mechanisms, and 
326  key  pathways  involved  in  the  effect  of  a  drug.  Here,  HL-60  (FAB  M2  14%  in  AML; 
327  TP53/CDKN2A/NRASmut) and OCI-AML3 (FAB M4 20% in AML; DNMT3Amut, NPMc+) 
328  cell lines were chosen to cover an important part of AML patients with non-assigned therapy 
329  [in contrast to  it is the case of FAB-M3] [44] [45]. Previous proteomic and phosphoproteomic 
330  analyses in both cell lines showed common but also specific ways CIGB-300 impacts cell 
331  apoptosis and/or the cell cycle [21, 24]. Gene expression profiles in both cell lines would also 
332  allow sensing what are general, or more specific mechanisms in relation to genetic backgrounds 
333  and differentiation states of leukemic cells. This study will give a new view at an earlier step 
334  of regulation. This is the first report of the gene expression profile modulated for CIGB-300 in 
335  HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cell lines using a microarray approach. 
336  The Multidimensional Scaling and the ANOVA R2 of covariates analysis showed the main 
337  differences  are  governed  by  the  cell  line  background  and  later,  by  treatment  and  time. 
338  Nevertheless, the heatmap picture showed a Cluster I comprising genes that are up-regulated 
339  in both cell lines although with differential magnitudes and kinetics. Interestingly, this cluster

340  is composed of genes encoding transcription factors responding to stress stimulus as EGR1 and 
341  AP-1 components, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β and TNFα, and chemokines, 
342  including IL8. Most of them are part of the Top 100 up-regulated genes in the complete 
343  experiment, with a higher increase in HL-60. NFAT Transcription factor pathway was found 
344  enriched in both cell lines. Although the Calcineurin–NFAT pathway was described in T cells 
345  as acting as a master regulator of lymphocyte development and effector T-cell functions [46], 
346  it is also essential in myeloid lineages for their defense function against pathogens [47]. NFAT 
347  factors can cooperate with transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kB to modify immune 
348  responses. NFAT expression also increased in murine bone marrow cultures stimulated with 
349  M-CSF (encoded by CSF1) [48]. In normal physiology, M-CSF triggers hematopoietic stem 
350  cells to differentiate into macrophages/monocytes and in our experiment, CSF1 increased their 
351  gene expression after 3h of peptide treatment in HL-60. Leukemia-derived cells lines come 
352  from hematopietic precursors with potential to differentiate into immunocells. Ramírez et al 
353  (2017)  profiled  HL-60  promyelocytes  differentiating  into  macrophages,  neutrophils, 
354  monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages in a time series experiment from 3h to 168h 
355  [49]. Similarly, they found a rapid response at 3h with the expression of key transcription 
356  factors and lineage markers, including EGR1, EGR2, RELB, and NFKB2 in macrophage of 
357  both  subtypes  and  NR4A1,  NR4A2,  NR4A3,  EGR3  and  FOSB  in  monocyte-derived 
358  macrophages. Heatmap of other differentially expressed transcriptional regulators showed the 
359  increase, as early as 3h, of AP-1 elements, REL/REL A, and inflammatory molecules such as 
360  IL1B or CCL2. This differentiation program is very well controlled over time with waves of 
361  expressions. NFAT pathway can also be stimulated via pattern recognition receptors (PRR) 
362  which increases the expression of IL2, -10, or -12. IL-10 signaling is enriched after 30min of 
363  treatment  in  OCI-AML3.  These  elements  joined  to  the  enrichment  of  regulation  of 
364  hematopoiesis as biological process, along the experiment for the M2 cell line HL-60, and 
365  regulation of cell differentiation in both cell lines with different kinetics are indicating CIGB-
366  300 possibly triggers differentiation in leukemic cells. Corroboration should be done measuring 
367  differentiation membrane markers in proper controlled experiments.   
368  This  transcriptomic  analysis  has  particularly  revealed  the  stimulation  of  cytokine  and 
369  chemokine responses, as a quick molecular response to CIGB-300 and the involvement of an 
370  inflammatory response as part of the mechanism of this peptide. These CIGB-300 targeted cell 
371  lines are myeloid precursor in an intermediate state of differentiation that can evolve to become 
372  into effector myeloid cells and then their response could mimic that of an antigen-presenting

373  cell. The presence of the cationic Tat penetrating peptide as part of the CIGB-300 sequence 
374  contributes to its rapid internalization within 3 min in 80 % of the cells [21]. Previous reports 
375  with other penetrating peptides have shown the increased uptake by antigen-presenting cells 
376  and the induction of a potent CD8+ T cell immunity. Using OVA as a vaccine antigen model, 
377  a potent antigen-specific immune response was induced with increases in IgG titer, splenocyte 
378  proliferation, secretion of cytokines IFN-, IL12, IL4, and IL10, immune memory function, 
379  and the activation and maturation of dendritic cells [50]. CIGB-300 has not elicited an antibody 
380  response after mice immunization (unpublished results), thus additional mechanisms where 
381  immune inflammatory response can contribute to change cells phenotypes, recruit effector 
382  immune cells nearby leukemic cells and then help to control cancer cell proliferation should be 
383  participating. This inflammatory response is higher in HL-60 after 3h of treatment, involving 
384  IL18 signaling. This pathway shares components  with IL1 to activate NF-kB signaling, 
385  adhesion  molecules,  chemokines,  IFN-,  IL4/IL13  and  Fas  ligand  [51].  Cell  chemotaxis 
386  process is a process enriched in the HL-60 cell line while IL4/IL13 signaling was enriched at 
387  3h in OCI-AML3. Heatmap Cluster II comprised genes participating in the positive regulation 
388  of leukocyte-mediated immunity, that only down-regulated expression in OCI-AML3 at a 3h 
389  time point. Evidently, both cell lines interpret initial inflammatory signaling in different ways 
390  and timing.  
391  Higher number of regulated genes in HL-60 compared to OCI-AML3, mainly after 3h of 
392  treatment, indicates both models have their own ways to achieve the anti-proliferative state. 
393  Based on DEGs, iRegulon plugin predicted transcription factors with a NES score, and showed 
394  the early activation AP-1 components (JUN or JUND) and NF-kB family members together 
395  with EGR and other TF. The role of AP-1 and NF-kB family members is reinforced after 3h of 
396  peptide treatment only in HL-60, where JUNB, FOS, and REL are incorporated into the 
397  prediction. Networking analysis also showed a high degree of connections from several of these 
398  nodes.  The  vision  of  time  dependence  as  well  as  their  centrality  to  interact  with  other 
399  components of the functional net, including those genes participating in Apoptosis and Cell 
400  Cycle is better for HL-60 with 304 functional links. Although TFs are very well connected in 
401  the net for OCI-AML3, the ramification to the other genes is less evident showing that as few 
402  as 42 genes are functionally linked. 
403  Singh et al (2011) showed AP-1 transcription factor family members’ c-Jun and JunB were 
404  transcriptionally activated in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treated AML cells, leading 
405  to the activation of GADD45A with Apoptosis induction [52]. CIGB-300 has been shown to

406  have an impact on apoptosis in AML cells [21] and the process was found enriched in these 
407  cell lines after a proteomic experiment [24]. Extrinsic apoptotic plays an important role in the 
408  immune surveillance of transformed cells and it is activated by cytokine ligands binding (i.e., 
409  FasL, TNF, and TRAIL) to members of the TNFα receptor superfamily, also called death 
410  receptors (i.e., Fas, TNF, and TRAIL receptors), followed by the activation of an active 
411  caspase-8 and beyond effector caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7) [53]. The pro-apoptotic effect of 
412  CIGB-300 in OCI-AML3 cells was supported in the proteomic experiment by the increase of 
413  BAK,  FADD,  caspase-7,  and  gasdermin-D  levels  [24];  while  in  HL-60,  elements  that 
414  counteract pro-apoptotic stimuli, probably to allow DNA damage repair under low levels of 
415  genotoxic stress, were over-expressed. In our experiment, FAS gene expression increased by 
416  1.55 at 3h of treatment and TRAIL (encoded by TNFSF10) progressively increased along the 
417  experiment in HL-60. Preclinical models have shown recombinant TRAIL induces tumor 
418  regression with little toxicity to normal tissues [54]. In OCI-AML3, this apoptotic pathway 
419  showed no other changes that the increase in TRAIL receptor (encoded by TNFRSF10A) at 3h 
420  with a low FC of 1.27.  In accordance, Positive regulation of cell death and Death Receptor 
421  signaling were shown as enriched Biological Processes in the Metascape tool at 3h in HL-60, 
422  including genes FAS, TNF, TNFRSF12A, TNFSF10, and also BCL2L11, encoding for the pro-
423  apoptotic BIM in the intrinsic pathway [53].    
424  NFAT  members  also  participate  in  the  transcription  of  several  cytokines  and  signaling 
425  molecules with the activation or inhibition of Cell cycle [55]. The CDK inhibitor P21 is also 
426  regulated by this transcription factor. Here, we found CDKN1A (encoding P21) up-regulated 
427  after 3h of CIGB-300 treatment in both cell lines. In HL-60, a higher number of CDKN1A 
428  network interactions were found and a higher mRNA expression after 2h and 8h of CIGB-300 
429  treatment was also demonstrated by qPCR. In contrast, OCI-AML3 showed the highest P21 
430  increases at 30 min, although with lower values than in HL-60. Balusu et al. demonstrated 
431  NPM1 knockdown induced P53 and P21 and decreased the percentage of cells in S-phase of 
432  the cell cycle, thus this could be also the relation in this NPM1-mutated cell line [56]. The cell 
433  cycle related gene encoding GADD45B, targeted by P53 and c-REL, also showed differential 
434  regulation in both cell lines after qPCR validation. The modulation of P21 and GADD45B by 
435  CIGB-300 in both cell lines is another example of how the antiproliferative response could be 
436  achieved depending on cell background.  
437  The induction of TNF response is evident in all groups of this experiment, with higher increases 
438  reached in HL-60.  Four putative NFAT-binding sites, but also EGR1 and AP-1 binding sites,

439  have  been  demonstrated  in  the  TNF-α  promoter,  a  gene  that  also  increased.  Systemic 
440  administration of TNF in cancer therapy has been avoided because of its pro-inflammatory 
441  actions but TNF destroys tumor-associated blood vessels by apoptosis and improves vascular 
442  permeability to cytotoxic drugs. Thus a more controlled application displays advantages. 
443  Curnis et al (2000) showed that low doses of TNF improved penetration of doxorubicin in the 
444  treatment of melanoma and lymphoma [57]. Here, we showed increases in the gene encoding 
445  TNF in both cell lines although increases were higher in the HL-60 cell line at gene and 
446  protein levels. Moreover, TNFα induction is transient as the protein expression is decreased 
447  24h after peptide treatment compared to 3h. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling is bifurcated 
448  into three different paths affecting cellular fate. In the absence of TRADD, ligand binding to 
449  TNFR1 recruits RIP1 producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating the JNK signaling 
450  cascade, and cells then die by apoptosis [58]. Incubation of AML cells with CIGB-300 peptide 
451  increased ROS production in HL-60 cells but not in OCI-AML3 cells. As a consequence, the 
452  HL-60  proteomic  profile  included  ROS  metabolic  as  an  enriched  process  [24]  and  the 
453  connection between ROS de-regulation and CIGB-300-induced apoptosis was demonstrated. 
454  ROS can sustain JNK activity allowing TNFα to kill cells in which NF-kB is active [53]. In the 
455  other  hand, autocrine binding of TNF to TNFR2 up-regulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
456  IL10 in monocytes and clears TNF from the environment, serving as a balance for the pro- and 
457  anti-inflammatory actions of this cytokine [59]. As we mentioned before, IL10 signaling was 
458  enriched in OCI-AML3 at 30 min. This could be part of the explanation for the low TNF 
459  detected in the supernatants of OCI-AML3 (10.3 pg/mL) compared to HL-60 (66.7 pg/mL) at 
460  3h of treatment. The measure of TNFR1&TNFR2 membrane expression, as well as TNF 
461  secretion in a time course experiment, could clarify possible mechanisms and contributions in 
462  both models.  
463  TNF signaling is also linked to NF-kB signaling. Although NF-kB signaling pathway has been 
464  mainly associated with a survival response in cancer to protect cells from apoptosis [60] 
465  different drugs targeting this cascade have been developed to control cancer cell proliferation 
466  [61]. Dual functions of NF-kB signaling appear to result from the ability of these transcription 
467  factors to either activate or repress transcription of genes depending on interaction with 
468  transcription  co-activator  or  repressors  and  post-translational  modifications  [62,  63].  For 
469  instance, DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents can lead to NF-kB activation by initiating 
470  signals generated in the nucleus [64][65]. However, modulation of the NF-kB pathway and 
471  temporal dynamic depends on the cell type and the nature and amount of the agent [66, 67]. At

472  present, the molecular characterization of the effect of CIGB-300 on the NF-kB signaling 
473  pathway is not fully elucidated. As a preliminary study we explored the gene expression of 
474  different components of canonical NF-kB signaling pathways by qPCR. In both AML-cell 
475  lines, we detected an over-expression  of NFKBIA/IKBα, NFKB1/p50, NFKB2/p52, and 
476  TNFAIP3/A20 at 3h post-treatment although higher in HL-60. Interesting, only in HL-60, c-
477  Rel/REL shows that same increase at 3h, as well as its target MAP3K8. In contrast, although 
478  we did not find a gene regulation for REL or REL A in OCI-AML3 an increase in their target 
479  GADD45B was accounted during the experiment setting. The activation of this cascade in both 
480  cell lines was then validated by qPCR with different magnitudes and paths.  
481  CK2 protein kinase phosphorylates IkB (NF-kB inhibitor/NFKBIA gene) which promotes its 
482  degradation and releasing of NF-kB complexes to enter into the nucleus [68]. NF-kB p65/REL 
483  A subunit is also phosphorylated by CK2 in Ser529; both phosphorylation events implicate 
484  activation of this transcription factor [69]. CK2 inhibitors, CX-4945 and CIGB-300, have 
485  evidenced a clear inhibitory effect on the NF-kB signaling pathway [21, 70, 71]. Particularly, 
486  in two non-small-cell lung cancer models, the anti-proliferative effect was accompanied by the 
487  inhibition of the CK2-dependent canonical NF-kB pathway, with reduced REL A/p65 nuclear 
488  levels and conditionally reduced NF-kB transcriptional activity [71]. In the AML context, we 
489  demonstrated an up-regulation of some of the NF-kB target genes as well as TNF-α as one of 
490  these pathway inducer, following treatment with CIGB-300. This fact could be related to the 
491  activation of apoptosis as molecules from the mitochondrial (intrinsic) and death receptor 
492  (extrinsic) apoptotic pathways (ex. p53, Fas and FasL, TNFα, TRAIL, receptors DR4, DR5, 
493  DR6, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members) are NF-kB transcriptional targets [53]. Certainly, a 
494  closer inspection of whether NF-kB signaling activation in AML cells triggers the apoptotic 
495  machinery induced by CIGB-300 or cell rescue signals upon cell exposure to the drug remain 
496  to be established.  
497  In conclusion, we present the temporal gene profile in two cellular models for AML, HL-60 
498  and OCI-AML3, treated with the peptide CIGB-300. An interesting finding at this early step 
499  of regulation is the increase of TF, cytokines and chemokines related to stress stimulus and 
500  inflammation since 30min of treatment which increases at 3h; TNF and NF-kB signaling are 
501  also stimulated at a higher proportion in HL-60. In this cell line, IL18 signaling is enriched in 
502  contrast to IL10 and IL4/IL13 signaling in OCI-AML3. Hematopoiesis and differentiation are 
503  also stimulated. Even when other experiments have shown the  role of the peptide over 
504  apoptosis and cell cycle, this microarray profile gives new clues about the role of TNF and NF-

505  kB  signaling  to  accomplish  those  effects.  The  networking  from  several  TF  show  the 
506  diversification to processes actors and the particular ways both cell lines achieve similar 
507  biological effects. Temporal gene expression shows that together with the anti-proliferative 
508  mechanism, CIGB-300 can stimulate immune responses by increasing immunomodulatory 
509  cytokines which, when locally secreted, may activate the immune system for tumor attack and 
510  blast  cell  control.  This  dual  mechanism  underscores  this  peptide  as  a  promising  AML
