Investigation performed at Chang Gung University, Taoyuan
Background:Rotatorcuff(RC)tendinopathyisoneofthemostcommoncausesofshoulderpain.Platelet-richplasma(PRP)has
beenfrequentlyusedinclinicalscenarios,butitsefficacyremainsinconsistent.
Purpose:ToinvestigatethedifferentresponsesofhumantenocytesfromtornRCstoleukocyte-richPRP(LR-PRP)andleukocyte-
poorPRP(LP-PRP)ina2-chambercoculturedevice.
StudyDesign:Controlledlaboratorystudy.
Methods: PRP was prepared using different platelet and leukocyte concentrations according to 5 groups: (1) LR-PRP with
5000platelets/mL,(2)LR-PRPwith10,000platelets/mL,(3)LP-PRPwith5000platelets/mL,(4)LP-PRPwith10,000platelets/mL,and
(5)controlwithonlyculturemediumsupplementationandwithoutPRPstimulation.Platelet-derivedgrowthfactor–AB(PDGF-AB)
and transforming growth factor–b1 (TGF-b1) were measured in LR-PRP and LP-PRP via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Microscopy,water-solubletetrazoliumsaltassay,andquantitativereal-timepolymerasechainreactionwereusedtoinvestigate
themorphology,proliferation,andgeneexpressionofRCtenocytesexposedtodifferentPRPformulations.Datawerecollected
fromatleast3independentmeasurements.Theresultswereanalyzedvia1-wayanalysisofvariance,followedbytheposthoc
Bonferronitest.
Results: The ratio of leukocytes to 5000 platelets/mL was 29.5 times higher in LR-PRP than in LP-PRP (P < .05). In the
5000platelets/mLgroups,thelevelsofTGF-b1andPDGF-ABwerebothsignificantlyhigherinLR-PRPversusLP-PRP(TGF-b1:
367.0±16.5vs308.6±30.3pg/mL,respectively[P¼.043];PDGF-AB:172.1±1.8vs94.1±4.2pg/mL,respectively[P<.001]).
Comparedwiththecontrolgroup,RCtenocyteproliferationwas1.42±0.01and1.41±0.03timeshigherintheLR-PRPgroups
with 5000 platelets/mL and 10,000 platelets/mL, respectively (P < .05). The expression of tenocyte-related genes was higher in
tenocytesculturedinLR-PRP.
Conclusion: Both the LR-PRP groups with 5000 platelets/mL and 10,000 platelets/mL induced more growth factor release and
increasedRCtenocyteproliferationthandidtheLP-PRPgroups.
ClinicalRelevance:InRCrepair,LR-PRPmaybebetterthanLP-PRPforincreasingtheproliferationoftenocytes.
