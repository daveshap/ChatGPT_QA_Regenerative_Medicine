Insufficient intracellular anabolism is a crucial factor involved in many pathological 
Open access processes in the body1,2. The anabolism of intracellular substances requires the 
 Check for updates consumption of sufficient intracellular energy and the production of reducing 
equivalents. ATP acts as an ‘energy currency’ for biological processes in cells3,4, and 
the reduced form of NADPH is a key electron donor that provides reducing power  
for anabolism5. Under pathological conditions, it is difficult to correct impaired 
anabolism and to increase insufficient levels of ATP and NADPH to optimum 
concentrations1,4,6–8. Here we develop an independent and controllable nanosized 
plant-derived photosynthetic system based on nanothylakoid units (NTUs). To enable 
cross-species applications, we use a specific mature cell membrane (the chondrocyte 
membrane (CM)) for camouflage encapsulation. As proof of concept, we demonstrate 
that these CM-NTUs enter chondrocytes through membrane fusion, avoid lysosome 
degradation and achieve rapid penetration. Moreover, the CM-NTUs increase 
intracellular ATP and NADPH levels in situ following exposure to light and improve 
anabolism in degenerated chondrocytes. They can also systemically correct energy 
imbalance and restore cellular metabolism to improve cartilage homeostasis and 
protect against pathological progression of osteoarthritis. Our therapeutic strategy 
for degenerative diseases is based on a natural photosynthetic system that can 
controllably enhance cell anabolism by independently providing key energy and 
metabolic carriers. This study also provides an enhanced understanding of the 
preparation and application of bioorganisms and composite biomaterials for the 
treatment of disease.
