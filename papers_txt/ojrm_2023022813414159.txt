and resilience, grow readily on collagen and laminin within wrinkles of skin 
surfaces, thus enhancing the color, luster, and texture of the skin “plated” with 
them. Alternatively, they can be injected subcutaneously as cell filler to reduce 
wrinkles. Intramuscular injection of myoblasts can augment the size, shape, 
consistency, tone, and strength of muscle groups, improving the lines, contours, 
and vitality to sculpt a youthful appearance. By improving cell genetics and 
organ functions, the program holds promise to sustain the human subject in 
good health and appearance, with a good quality of life and life prolongation.

1. Introduction 
Aging is hereditary [1]. It is characterized with progressive cell degeneration and 
tissue attrition, leading to organ failure and death. Myoblast Transfer Therapy 
(MTT) is a genetic cell therapy which replenishes dead myofibers with live ones, 
and repairs degenerative myofibers with normal complimentary genes [2]. MTT 
prevents organ failure, intervening with disease onset and/or progression, thus 
prolonging the life expectancy of the human subjects [3]. By maintaining normal 
function of various bodily organs in which myofibers are a constituent, MTT 
sustains the human subject in good health with a good quality of life [4]. It is an 
area with great promise that can be traced to one of the earliest INDs of cell thera-
py and gene therapy, numbered BB-IND 5108, approved on May 13, 1993 by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in facilitating the availability of safe and 
effective treatments [5].  
2. Pathogenesis and Signs of Aging 
The earliest signs of aging are loss of energy and strength due to genetically pro-
gramed degeneration of ATP-producing mitochondria (Figure 1) [4]. Mitochon-
drial degeneration diminishes energy production, body warmth, physical activi-
ty, leading to disuse atrophy and degeneration of fast-twitch (Type II A and B) 
muscle fibers [6] that account for slow movement and incoordination in the el-
derlies. Tendon origin and/or insertion of atrophic muscles are often unduly 
overstretched causing excruciating pain to the subject. Weakening of anal and 
urinary sphincter muscles can even affect excretory function. Women after two 
to three natural childbirths may experience stressed urinary incontinence (SUI) 
just like men after surgical removal of hypertrophic prostates. Perhaps the loss of 
muscle bulk and strength is the most significant deficit of aging. Whereas this 
loss is socially accepted as a normal trend of physiologic development, it is this 
deficit which hinders the subject to continue to work, socialize, or to participate 
in professional sports.  
Losses of muscle fibers and physical activity are a vicious cycle affecting not 
only skeletal muscles but the overlying skin also. Reductions in muscle volume 
coupled with constant muscle stretching and relaxation are direct causes of fine 
lines and wrinkles on aging skin which begins to lose elasticity, smoothness, 
suppleness and firmness. This aging process of the skin is accelerated with long 
exposure to the ultraviolet sunray (photo-aging) and to dry wind. Stress, lack of 
sleep, bad habits and diets all add to it. The aged skin develops age spots and ac-
tinic keratosis with accumulation of melanocytes, a rough non-homogeneous 
stratum corneum and a thinner dermis. These serious alterations in skin struc-
ture often cause change in membrane permeability to various ions in the sensory 
nerve endings embedded in the skin surface, causing allergy and itching. Skin fi-
broblasts usually undergo mitotic divisions to cope with adverse conditions in 
attempt to maintain homeostasis. However, their lack of substantial regenerative 
capability as limited by their telomere content forces the oncogenes to be turned 
on and results in skin cancer.

Addiction of coffee (caffeine), tea (nicotine), alcohol and/or drugs significant-
ly reduces calcium and magnesium ion absorption leading to osteoporosis, bone 
fracture and premature loosening and loss of teeth. The latter is often associated 
with gum atrophy. The greatest storages of these ions in the body are in the sar-
coplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers and the blood stream.

The blood circulatory system, especially arterioles, venules, and capillaries 
become construed or brittle with age and break, leading to cell death as in ischemic 
heart disease, stroke, and in Type-II diabetic patients with ischemic skin which 
necessitates skin grafting or even amputation. Central to capillary blockade and 
breakage is the loss of oxygen and nutrients to the end-organs, resulting in hair 
loss, erectile dysfunction, pale face, and significant reduction in regenerative ac-
tivity and capability.  
Mitochondrial degeneration in brain cells causes lack of instant recall, even 
long-term memory. Death of neurons, Schwan cells and astrocytes lead to lacunar 
infarction of cerebral cortex, brain stem and cerebellum resulting in brain atrophy. 
The structural and functional losses all contribute to distortion of the former 
youthful appearance and joyous psycho, ultimately distressing the subject and in 
severe situations result in depression, and schizophrenia. 
As such, aging is a hereditary, chronically debilitating and ultimately fatal dis-
ease. Anti-aging is a medical science different from cosmetic cover-ups. It con-
veys great social values in contrast to the general perception of its just having 
economic values. The gross abuse of scientific understanding without demon-
strating the safety and efficacy of treatment procedures for lucrative financial 
gain constitutes medical malpractice.  
3. Market Size 
The baby-boomers after the Second World War are over 75. They will be the 
prime users of AARC. The world revolves around the achievers who are usually 
over 35. There are numerous body builders and beauty users in their twenties 
and even late teens. Then there are those with birth deformities, trauma, burns, 
surgical wounds, malnutrition and others. It is estimated that more than 50% of 
the world population now needs some form of AARC treatments. With expo-
nential growth of cell therapy technologies in regenerative medicine, human be-
ings will live past 100 years before this century ends. These elder and wiser people 
will demand better appearance and better quality of life. In time, almost every 
living human being will need one or more of such enhancement with age. 
4. Beauty and Its Parameters 
Beauty is a physical attribute that often enhances one’s self-confidence, career 
and quality of life. Whereas there is a common perception about what consti-
tutes beauty, beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. Advances in artificial in-
telligence and 3D-typing allow computerized animation for the subject’s body 
part to be modified to the liking of the subject. The ability to control and mod-
ulate the various physical parameters of appearance using the genetic cell thera-
py of MTT ensures customized satisfaction.  
The physical parameters of appearance are size, shape, tone, color, luster, 
texture, consistency, and density. These inborn characteristics may not satisfy 
the subject’s fancy. These parameters deteriorate in every external organ ac-

cording to the genetically programmed degeneration of aging. Throughout the 
ages, there are numerous anti-aging ways using non-living ingredients. Current 
technologies favor human cell therapies using live cells, cytokines and co-factors 
to enhance the parameters of appearance. These biologics, as they are called, are 
designed to provide improvement of appearance and function. 
5. Cell Therapy Cosmetics 
The cell is the basic unit of all life. They are the building blocks of the bodily or-
gans. Good health is the well-being of all bodily cells. Cells are what life is made 
of. In aging or degenerative conditions, cells degenerate and die, rendering the 
organ (e.g. hair, skin, muscles, breasts, sex organs) which they inhabit dysfunc-
tional. An effective treatment must not only repair degenerating cells, but also 
replace dead cells with live ones as well. This can best be achieved by the trans-
plantation of genetically normal cells, or cell therapy [6].  
Cell culture in the laboratory is the only method known to man for the repli-
cation of new live cells. With proper in vitro techniques and precautions, normal 
cells can be cultured in compliance to standards to repair degenerates and 
wounds, and to replenish the degenerative organ with new live cells [7]. 
Cell transplantation allows propagation of “new life” in degenerative tissues. The 
dysfunctional organ, once invaded with scar and necrotic tissue, is now repopulated 
with live cells that augment its appearance (Figure 2) and function (Figure 3). 
6. Myoblast Anti-Aging Therapy   
Human beings are products of evolution. In the last 160 million years of mam-
malian evolution, skeletal muscles have developed to occupy 55% of the volume 
of the human body. With every muscle fiber containing 200 to 500 nuclei, and 
approximately 100 mitochondria adjacent to every muscle nucleus, MTT is the 
best regenerative technology to rejuvenate the body by providing DNAs and 
ATP. No other tissue in the human body exhibit a higher density of nuclei and 
mitochondria, the organelles that harbor DNAs and ATP for production of 
strength and energy (Figure 4). Thus, the FDA approved Phase II and Phase III 
50-billion-MTT protocol that was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in 
human clinical trials [8] literally implanted 50 billion muscle nuclei and 5 trillion 
mitochondria into 80 large muscle groups of single Duchenne muscular dystro-
phy (DMD) boys and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) adults. Many of 
these subjects demonstrated significant improvement in quality of life and life 
prolongation [4]. They represented a small group of seriously genetically defec-
tive individuals saved by MTT. The same technology can be applied to anti-aging 
in improving muscle structure and function. Advancements in tissue-resident 
adult stem/progenitor cell research have revealed that enhanced telomere attri-
tion, oxidative stress, ultraviolet radiation exposure and oncogenic events lead-
ing to severe DNA damages and genomic instability may occur in these imma-
ture and regenerative cells during chronological aging [9].

The feelings of being weak and cold during aging indicate degradation of the 
energy production network of mitochondria (Figure 1) [10] densely populating 
the neuromuscular systems that are doing the real heavy lifting (Figure 4). 
Striated muscles, cardiac muscles and smooth muscles that occupy approx-
imately 55% by volume of the human body are constantly at work to maintain 
body temperature and normal metabolism. Degradation of the power network of 
adeno-triphosphate (ATP) production leads directly to cell apoptosis, organ 
malfunction and eventually human death [4].  
With the 50-B MTT into 80 large muscle groups of the body, there was a 
mean 70% increase in normal myofiber number attributed to donor myoblast 
fusion after transplantation [8]. Considering that each myofiber contains 200 to 
500 muscle nuclei, literally trillions of mitochondria from young men are im-
planted with each 50-billion MTT to regenerate the energy network of life. These 
are not isolated and manipulated mitochondria that have difficulty in integrating 
into the human body through mitochondrial transfusion [11]. The MTT proto-
col was the one that has kept some DMD patients living in their 30’s and 40’s in-

stead of expiring at age 20 [3] [4] [12] [13]. It may have similar effect on the el-
derlies and Type-II diabetics [14]. 
The proof-of-concept presented above indicated that intramuscular injection 
of myoblasts can augment the size, shape, consistency, tone, and strength of 
muscle groups, improving the lines, contours, and vitality from the sculpture for 
a youthful appearance. Table 1 illustrated the gradual increase in muscle strength 
as contractile filaments like actin, myosin, troponin and tropomyosin were de-
posited and organized after the myotubes were vascularized, innervated and 
matured to be muscle fibers. An average 123% increase in maximum contractile 
force at 18 months after MTT was obtained taking the means from four major 
muscle groups of the body. The results were based on studies of 50-B MTT on 
DMD muscles. Given the treatment, one would expect the elderlies, the athletes, 
the soldiers and the astronauts will out-perform the DMD boys in these increas-
es in muscle contractility.   
7. Facial Rejuvenation 
The face identifies an individual. It is the first impression to a stranger. For love 
of beauty, an inborn beautiful or handsome face often bestows and conveys its 
owner special opportunities and benefits, especially in life-long events such as 
career, marriage and friendship that are linked directly to one’s happiness. Thus, 
it is not surprising that not only the rich and powerful but innumerous well-to-do 
people have become addicted to facial rejuvenation. With the baby-boomers af-
ter the Second World War all approaching age 75, facial rejuvenation becomes a 
norm for the 962 million people over age 60. This market size, however, is noth-
ing compared to that of users with age spanning from 25 to 65.  
8. Biologic Skin Cover 
Cell replacement and targeting of the molecular systems found in skin hold great 
promise for controlling or even curing skin aging [15]. Myoblasts and foreskin 
fibroblasts are differentiated cells committed to their lineages. They are capable 
of extensive cell division in culture. The two cell types can be used to develop

ology, 1: 345-363, 1998).

into body cover, either singly or in combination. Myoblasts, because of their 
small size, spindle shape, and resilience, can grow within wrinkles and on colla-
gen and laminin of skin surfaces without blood supply, thus enhancing the color, 
luster and texture of the skin “plated” with them (Figure 5). They can have an-
ti-inﬂammatory and antiapoptotic properties by paracrine-secreting growth fac-
tors and cytokines on the site of administration [16]. 
The common skin fibroblasts are polygonal, 10 to 15 times the size of the 
myoblasts and produce a rougher body cover. Cancers are commonly associated 
with skin fibroblasts but not with myoblasts and foreskin fibroblasts. Thus, a 
new layer of biological skin consisting of pure myoblasts and/or foreskin fibrob-
lasts can eliminate skin defects and blemishes. Safe and efficacious for the hands 
with serious wrinkles, the technology will be applicable for wrinkle and blemish 
reduction for the face and other skin parts.  
A patented method for refurbishing skin of an individual comprises 1) re-
moving dead cells from the surface of the skin with a smooth abrasive or by one 
or more chemicals such as lactic acid to generate a prepared surface and 2) ap-
plying myoblasts in a myoblast cell-nutritive solution to the prepared skin sur-
face. The myoblast cell suspension useful for skin enhancement of an individual, 
comprising autologous or allogeneic human myoblasts, serum from the individ-
ual, an angiogenesis factor and large 6 chondroitin sulfate for controlled, rapid 
cell fusion of the myoblasts. The invention may also use foreskin fibroblast cell 
suspension in a similar process, either singly or in combination with myoblasts.  
Myoblasts from a serum-like suspension (MYOLA) is applied as thick layer(s) 
with a sterile brush to the prepared skin surface such that the myoblasts survive, 
develop, and become integrated into the collagen and laminin of the human 
skin, thereby filling in cracks, crevices, wrinkles, blemishes, holes and laser scars 
of the skin. The myoblasts smooth imperfections in the skin and provide further 
qualities such as resilience, coloration and strength. Warm moist oxy-
gen-containing air, or more preferably pure oxygen is blown onto the treated

area for at least 1 hour. Cell graft is left undisturbed for at least 12 or more 
hours. Thus, layers of biologic skin consisting of pure myoblasts and myotubes 
can eliminate skin defects and blemishes left behind after laser removal. The 
whole procedure may be repeated in intervals of 6 to 12 months to obtain smoother 
and younger looking skin. 
Similarly, foreskin fibroblasts may be used singly or in combination with myob-
lasts and/or myotubes to produce similar results. Foreskin fibroblasts advanta-
geously can provide smooth texture and tensile strength to the new skin. A mix-
ture of myoblasts and myotubes is particularly useful for filling in large skin areas 
such as large wrinkles. The presence of myotubes helps mechanically bridge large 
gaps, and the ratio and average size of the myotubes in such mixtures may be 
prepared and adjusted as needed. 
Myoblasts can be autologous obtained from the treated individual, or from 
other human beings. If not autologous, the immunosuppressant cyclosporine is 
administered 2 days in advance. Although other immune suppressants may be 
used, cyclosporine for 2 weeks at two oral doses totaling 5 mg/Kg body weight 
per day is preferred because it facilitates donor cell survival.  
Myoblasts can be also injected subcutaneously as a cellular filler to reduce 
wrinkles.

9. MYOLA (Biologic Skin Cream) 
Biologic creams are formulated to promote cell survival, growth and develop-
ment to enhance the color, luster, density and texture of the skin. Fair skin is de-
sirable, but its exposure to radiation of strong sunlight often leads to skin cancer. 
Myola, a unique essence formulated with myoblast extracts, is specially designed 
to rejuvenate the fair skin. Among other ingredients, it comprises  
1) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), an anti-cancer and a whitening factor;  
2) telomeres [17], a mitotic agent to enhance cell division; 
3) mitochondria, the ATP manufacturer to provide energy for regeneration; 
4) muscle nuclei, the DNA supplier of regenerative proteins for cell repair. 
In additional to being used as a carrier solution in the skin refurbishing men-
tioned in the last section, MYOLA will find application in daily skin mainten-
ance.  
Endogenic and exogenous exosomes are being developed as treatment options 
to repair, regenerate, and rejuvenate skin [18]. The paracrine factors of stem 
cell-derived exosomes have significant potential as a cell-free therapy for scar 
treatment [19].

10. Soft Tissue Augmentation 
Intramuscular injection of myoblasts can augment the size, shape, consistency, 
tone and strength of muscle groups, improving the lines, contours and vitality 
from the sculpture for a youthful appearance [3]. The myoblast technology can 
be used for cosmetic enhancement such as bodybuilding and in tissue implants 
for breast/buttock/facial augmentation or reconstruction (Figure 6, Figure 7) 
[3]. 
The myoblasts can be injected intramuscularly to grow muscles, or subcuta-
neously as a filler. Unlike the noncellular collagen which will be absorbed in 
three to six months after injection, injected myoblasts are cells that will survive 
and last for tens of years within the host. Myoblasts are endogenous to the hu-
man body and have been proven safe in clinical trials involving over 300 muscu-
lar dystrophy patients and 300 heart patients worldwide [3]. Myoblasts will not 
cause cancer like silicone. Their constructs will not burst and be absorbed like 
saline or collagen implants. They develop to become myotubes and muscle fi-
bers.

11. Aging Diabetics 
Aging diabetics will be the ideal subjects to be tested on the Genetic Cell Thera-
py for Anti-Aging Regenerative Cosmetology of MTT because they suffered the 
combined pathological consequences of both aging and Type II diabetes. In the 
world’s first human gene therapy and somatic cell therapy [2], it was concluded, 
“Through natural cell fusion, which is inherent in myogenesis and muscle rege-
neration, donor myoblasts insert full complements of normal genes into dy-
strophic muscle fibers. Therefore, it does not matter which gene is abnormal or 
which protein is missing. MTT has potential application to all hereditary muscle 
diseases. It repairs degenerating cells and replenishes lost cells. This first case 
suggests that MTT offers a safe and effective means for alleviating muscle bio-
chemical deficit(s) in muscles of DMD.” This conclusion was extrapolated to a 
Type II diabetes clinical study testing for feasibility and safety [20], and to di-
abetic mouse studies for pathogenesis, mechanisms and proof-of-concept [21] 
[22].  
The  mouse  studies  indicated  that  xenotransplantation  of  normal  human 
myoblasts into limb skeletal muscles of KK diabetic mice up-regulated mul-
ti-genes involved in impaired insulin signaling pathway and mitochondria bio-
genesis and function. This was accompanied with improved glucose tolerance 
and reduced hyperglycemia in the KK mice. The results indicated that MTT re-
gulated the expression levels of genes that play important roles in the pathoge-
nesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance.  
It is anticipated that, in addition to providing a genetic cell therapy to relieve 
the various symptoms of Type-II diabetes, the 50-billion MTT will instill bio-
chemical, structural and functional improvements to the aged or aging subjects. 
It is long overdue to conduct clinical trial on this large population of aging di-
abetics using MTT, considering the devasting sufferings of the ill and the huge 
social economic burden borne by the national healthcare systems.

Distribution of oxygen and nutrients to the peripheral organs is significantly re-
duced for people aged over 45. In developing treatment for human myocardial 
infarction, we have grown five times more blood capillaries and muscle fibers 
simultaneously using human myoblasts transduced with human VEGF (vascular 
endothelial growth factor) gene [20] [23] [24]. In addition to their application 
to treating heart diseases [25]-[30], potentially these cells can be used to treat 
male/female impotency, baldness and to produce redder lips and pinker face be-
cause of the higher density of capillaries within layers of myogenic cells after 
myoblast treatment. The latter serves as a fertile ground to seed new hair follicle 
cells on the bald head or other body parts to give the desirable hair color, density 
and consistency. The effect of increased vascular reactivity may be useful in pa-
thological situations in which an intense angiogenesis is desirable, such as tissue 
ischemia [31]. Likewise, the angiomyogenic myoblasts can be chemically trans-
formed using bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) to become osteoblasts [32] for 
treating osteoporosis, bone fractures and loose tooth pulps (Figure 8). 
13. Bioactive Implants and Fractal Stimulation 
1) Coating of implantable materials with myogenic cells 
Allogeneic and autologous myoblasts are particularly useful for coating bio-
logical body parts, for example a pig heart valve, human damaged tissue, and 
non-biologics such as stents, plastic valves, plastic heart valves, vessels either

biologic or synthetic, and any other implantable materials. A biological tissue in 
this context may be for example, a sphincter muscle, a skin, a tongue, an eyelid, 
an eardrum, stomach tissue, bladder tissue, vascular tissue, artery section, vein 
section, aorta section, heart tissue. A skilled artisan can optimize the amount 
and conditions for coating. 
For example, a pig heart valve may be coated with myoblasts obtained from a 
muscle biopsy derived from the patient. Desirably, the pig heart valve, or other 
implant is first coated with a scaffold material such as fibronectin, laminin and/or 
collagen prior to coating with myoblasts. Desirably, the coating is thick enough 
to block sites of the uncoated surface from reacting with one or more compo-
nents of the immune surveillance system. Crosslinking adsorbed material may 
be carried out by any of known conventionally means to both ensure long term 
attachment and a suitable thickness. 
2) Implantation of Myogenic Cells, Particularly Autologous Cells for En-
hanced Muscle Function 
Many patients that need electrode stimulation enhancement of muscle func-
tion have weakened muscles. These muscles acquire improved function by trans-
planting myogenic cells before, during or after electrode implantation. Myogenic 
cells, such as autologous myogenic cells prepared from the patient beforehand, 
can be reintroduced at high levels, such as 106 to 107 cells, 107 to 108 cells, 108 to 
109 cells, or even higher. The cells, once introduced, fuse with preexisting muscle 
cells, thus contributing their DNA and fortifying the bulk of the native muscle. 
3) Synergy results from including myogenic cells with an electrode. The myo-
genic cells, when already attached to an electrode, shorten the time required for 
the body to accommodate the electrode. A smaller excitation current is required 
because of the accommodation of electrode with muscle cells in vitro, particu-
larly when the muscle cell morphology is altered prior to implantation with the 
use of entraining currents in vitro.  
For example, cells that coat the electrode and other cells in the vicinity, in an 
embodiment, are electrically stimulated by the electrode during growth in cul-
ture. The stimulation may occur over a period of at least 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 
hours, or 12 hours but preferably occurs for at least one day, two days or three 
days. This stimulation may facilitate the induction of genes involved with forma-
tion of the motor end plate and/or other features that desirably interact with the 
electrode. By increasing the amount of these features, a more sensitive electrode 
response may be elicited after implantation.  
In another desirable embodiment, nerve cell progenitors likewise are incu-
bated with the electrode in vitro before implantation. In a desirable embodi-
ment, nerve cells precursors and myogenic cells are incubated with the electrode 
in vitro and experience electrical activation of that electrode in vitro, which in-
duces the cells to form structures that respond to the electrical activation. The 
amount of electrical current and voltage used as well as periodicity and wave 
form, preferably similar to that used on the electrode after implantation. Prefer-

ably the stimulation is biphasic, to alleviate effects of electrolysis, and the in-
stantaneous current is less than 10 ma, more preferably less than 3 ma, and in 
some situations where repeated stimulations (more than once per 5 minutes) 
occur over an extended time, less than 0.5 ma or even less than 100 microam-
peres.

Therapeutic stimulation methodologies based on inherently fractal nature of 
physiologic dynamics involve the use of electrical currents, electromagnetic 
fields, temperature change, ultrasound, light, and so forth. These stimulation 
therapies can be categorized into three main modalities: electrical stimulation 
modalities, thermal modalities, and non-thermal modalities. Electrical stimula-
tion modalities include therapeutic techniques where electrical current is directly 
applied to the body of treated subject. Direct application of electrical current to 
the brain also falls under this category. Thermal modalities consist of stimula-
tions that induce temperature change on the body for therapeutic effects without 
the direct transfer of electrical current. Non-thermal modalities functions through 
energy transfer without directly applying electrical current and without the ef-
fects of temperature change. A fourth miscellaneous category for stimulation 
techniques consists of the stimulation effects of music along with physical sti-
mulation as in massage therapy. Common to most of these therapeutic strategies 
is that the stimulation is delivered at certain fixed periods or frequencies. We in-
troduce some rudiments of fractal dynamics, and the notions of self-similarity, 
scale-invariance, and long-range correlation or memory in the dynamics of a 
system [33]. We present evidence that fractal dynamics is commonly observed in 
healthy physiological systems while unhealthy systems are shown to veer away 
from fractal dynamics towards periodic or random motion. This difference in 
dynamics can be observed in many biological signals such as in neural activity, 
heart rate variations, and breathing patterns. We propose that an optimal stimu-
lation technique should thus be one that encourages an unhealthy, non-fractal 
pathological system towards a healthy, fractal dynamic. Given the ubiquity of 
fractality in healthy biological dynamics, we argue that a fractal pattern of sti-
mulation is a more optimal approach to functional restoration than the widely 
used conventional periodic stimulation, which may further consolidate the ex-
isting pathological dynamics [33].  
14. Stressed Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Fecal   
Incontinence (FI)   
These are embarrassing dysfunctions that inhibit socializing of innumerous 
numbers of women aged 45 upward. Birth of children has left these ladies, some 
holding important offices, with weakened internal and external sphincter mus-

cles. Publication over 1100 cases has demonstrated that MTT is safe and effica-
cious for SUI and FI. In conjunction with treating SUI, more myoblasts can be 
implanted into the vaginal wall to enhance tightness and contractile force during 
sexual intercourse. Current surgical and cauterizing techniques often left scars 
that created discomfort for both partners. Myoblast implantation over the pubic 
bone provides not only a sexier appearance, but also a “shock absorber” on im-
pact, thus reducing the piercing discomfort caused by the skinny yet attractive 
ladies. And for that special partner and moment, a hymen can be reconstructed 
from layers of myotubes cultured and patched on with fibronectin or biologic 
glue. Similar restructuring of the larynx can produce a sexier voice of higher 
pitch, a tympanum for the traumatized eardrum, a cellular patch for esophageal 
and/or stomach ulcers. 
15. Tendon Repair in Sport Medicine   
Myoblasts constitute a better biomaterial than tenocytes in synthesizing stronger 
and smoother tendons for transplantation repair. These tendons exhibited greater 
stiffness, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and could handle higher maximum 
load [34]. One can envision MTT developing into sport and military medicine in 
muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage and joint repairs. 
16. Tai Chi and Chi Gong   
No matter how good a muscle is endowed, it needs exercise to be in shape. In 
younger days, active sports provide competitive spirit and release of endorphins 
and hormones essential for maintenance of youth. In addition, muscle stretching 
such as in yoga induces new formation of sarcomeres, thus increasing the max-
imum contractile force. As one ages, active sports may over-stretch tendons, 
fracture bones and rupture capillaries.  
Tai Chi and Chi Gong are milder forms of exercise recommended to people 
aged 45 and over. The movements are slow and are designed to provide isotonic 
muscle contractions rather than purely isometric. Historically, these are two 
styles of Kung Fu developed by Chinese martial Taoists to maintain balance of 
body and mind. Tai Chi strengthens the postural muscles of the waist and the 
legs, thus helping to prevent the elderlies from falling. Chi Gong increases the 
oxygen content of the body by training and strengthening the respiratory mus-
cles such as the rectus abdominis, the oblique, the paraspinal muscles and the 
diaphragm in order to shift the ordinary thoracic breathing into the adapted 
abdominal mode.  
By willfully depressing the diaphragm and filling the lungs, one can increase 
oxygen intake. The mild and sustained movements of Chi Gong also enhance 
oxygen distribution via the blood circulatory system to various extremities of the 
body including the brain. The persistent inhaling and exhaling exercise train the 
body to develop low oxygen tolerance and strong nasotracheal muscles.  
Chi Gong has immense value for the wheelchair bound and bed-laden elder-

lies and patients. In addition to preventing disuse atrophy and oxygen depriva-
tion, Chi Gong provides the trained ability to cough up mucus from the trachea 
which proves to be invaluable in saving lives at times of pneumonia, COVID-19, 
and respiratory failure in DMD. Half an hour of Chi Gong a day chases the 
death spirit away.  
Many years of feeding often leave the alimentary canal stretched with fauna of 
bacteria and fungi. The latter feed on carbohydrate and fibers, generating large 
amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide that are toxic to the body. El-
derlies lacking exercise usually have gas entrapments in the intestine, causing 
distension and constipation. The intraabdominal pressure often leads to high 
blood pressure and heart ischemia. Tai Chi and Chi Gong are perhaps the best 
forms of exercise for the elderlies to relieve the yearnings for “Porsche” and 
“Ferrari”, though one is sitting in a Rolls Royce or Mercedes Benz.  
17. Familial Myoblast Cell Banks   
A myoblast cell line of 100 billion or more can be established from 2 grams of 
muscle biopsy from the healthiest male child of each family, to be used in the 
prevention, treatment or beautification of every family member. 
18. Conclusion   
The genetic cell therapy of MTT regenerates aging muscles and skin to provide 
added strength and youthful appearance. Implanted myoblasts, preferably allo-
geneic, survive, develop and function in the host with 2-weeks’ oral doses of an 
immunosuppressant. The myoblasts develop into muscle fibers, adding 70% new 
muscle cells to augment the size, shape and function of the injected muscle or 
organ. Intramuscular injection of 50 billion myoblasts into 80 major muscle groups 
under general anesthesia provides huge amounts of nuclei and mitochondria 
that are necessary to operate the regenerative processes. The inherent natural cell 
fusion of myoblasts incorporates nuclei transfer, foreign gene integration, regu-
lation and expression all in one encounter to ensure natural spatial and temporal 
transcription of the normal genome to produce whatever missing proteins that 
are necessary to be young again. Future directions include the concept of “preci-
sion cosmetic medicine” utilizing gene editing and cellular therapies to tailor re-
juvenation techniques based on individual’s genetic make-up and therefore needs 
[35]. Anti-aging regenerative medicine is as exciting as ever!
