39  ABSTRACT  
40  Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein (PML) is the core protein of nuclear bodies (NBs) that regulate a large 
41  number of cellular processes, including, context dependent, tumor –suppressor and pro-oncogenic 
42  effects. PML knockdown (KD) in breast cancer lines MDA-MB-231, but not MCF7, cells showed higher 
43  cell proliferation, increased migration properties and prolonged stem cell –like survival in line with 
44  gene enrichment results from RNA sequencing analysis. MDA-MB-231 PML KD cells showed an increase 
45  of hypoxic and mesenchymal characteristics manifested by higher HIF1a and the EMT- TWIST2 protein 
46  levels respectively. Mechanistically, PML loss caused an increase of HIF1a and TWIST2 RNA levels. 
47  Interestingly, TWIST2 binds to PML. Moreover, PML directly opposed the action of HIF1a and TWIST2 
48  on VEGFa and CD24 reporters, respectively. Tumor xenografts of MDA-MB-231 PML KD cells showed a 
49  higher micro vessel content, grew faster and had higher metastatic ability with a preference for lung. 
50  Thus, PML opposes the aggressive cancer phenotype by multiple mechanisms that antagonize the HIF-
51  hypoxia-angiogenic and EMT axis.  
52  1.INTRODUCTION  
53  Breast  cancer  is  characterized  by  genetic  and  epigenetic  complexity  and  phenotypic 
54  heterogeneity[1]. Differences between breast cancer-subtypes or patients referred as intertumoral 
55  heterogeneity as well as cellular diversity within the same tumors[2] is dynamically driven by genetic 
56  and epigenetic evolution and has an impact in patient’s prognosis and therapy. Major current efforts 
57  are directed towards the elucidation of factors that modify the action of critical oncogene or tumor 
58  suppressor  pathways  that  regulate  invasiveness,  metastatic  potential  and  drug  response  with 
59  predictive or therapeutic importance. 
60  The Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) gene was first described in the early 1990s at the point of 
61  chromosomal translocation t (15, 17), where it was found to encode an oncogenic chimeric protein 
62  emerging from the fusion of PML and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-α) in patients with acute 
63  promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The PML-RAR chimeric protein prevents the differentiation of bone 
64  marrow progenitor cells, sustaining their self-renewal capacity and preventing their apoptotic process, 
65  leading to leukemogenesis[3,4]. Promyelocytic leukemia protein is the key component of PML-NBs, 
66  which are nuclear membrane less compartments self-assembled through the RBCC motif interactions. 
67  By interacting and/or participating in the post-translational modifications of various nuclear proteins, 
68  PML-NBs regulate a variety of cellular processes such as apoptosis, proteolysis, cellular aging, cell self-
69  renewal capacity, DNA damage response, telomere stability, gene expression and chromatin/epigenetic 
70  states[5,6]. For example PML is highly expressed during murine mammary gland development, it’s 
71  barely detectable during pregnancy and lactation and it’s necessary for lineage commitment of bi-
72  potent luminal progenitor cells[7]. Moreover PML is essential for sustaining naïve pluripotent state in 
73  mouse embryonic stem cells[8].The role of PML in neoplasias seems to be complex. PML protein is lost 
74  in human cancers of various histologic origins, including breast cancer[9]. Various reports support a 
75  tumor suppressive role for PML[10]. Using an inducible expression of PML IV in the triple negative 
76  (TNBC) Claudin low (CLD) subtype MDA-MB-231 cell line, we found strong inhibition of cell proliferation 
77  and tumor sphere formation in a reversible manner[11]. Other studies point to a pro-survival role of

78  PML in non-tumorigenic or tumorigenic breast cell lines and find that high PML levels correlate with 
79  poor  prognosis  in  a  breast  cancer cohort[12].  Similarly,  high  PML expression  in  chronic myeloid 
80  leukemia maintains hematopoietic stem cells and PML ablation leads to an increase of their initial 
81  cycling activity that eventually leads to their eradication[13]. These studies suggest that PML may have 
82  divergent cells effects not only in different cell contexts but also in different temporal windows i.e. 
83  short vs long-term effects.  
84  Here we show that constitutive PML loss enhances cell migration in vitro & metastatic aggressiveness 
85  in vivo of TNBC cells. Cells derived from in vivo primary tumors or lung metastasis stably maintain an in 
86  vivo  aggressive  phenotype  and  transcriptionally  resemble  the  earlier  described  lung  metastasis 
87  signature (LMS)[14] that may result from either epigenetic or clonal evolution during in vivo growth in 
88  the absence of PML. Interestingly, we found that PML interacts and likely functionally affects the 
89  activity of various bHLH or Zinc finger type proteins including the master hypoxia regulator HIF1a and 
90  EMT mediators, such as TWIST2. Thus, PML may impede the aggressive EMT-metastatic behavior of 
91  TNBC cells, in line with transcriptional profiling that shows enrichment in adhesion, cell cycle and 
92  signaling categories deregulated by PML ablation.  
93  2.MATERIALS AND METHODS 
94  2.1.Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines 
95  The 293T cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,VA,USA), 
96  MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH 
97  (DSMZ, Braunschweig – Germany). They were authenticated in the past 2 years by PCR-single locus 
98  technology (Eurofins Genomics-Europe Applied Genomics GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany) using  the 
99  DSMZ  (http://www.dsmz.de/de/service/services)  and  the  Cellosaurus  database 
100  (https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus). Cells were mycoplasma free as determined by PCR (mycoplasma 
101  detection kit "Venor GeM classic "MINERVA BIOLABS, Berlin, Germany). 
102  For the generation of stable, knock down cell lines, cells were infected by puromycin or G418 
103  resistance -lentiviral vectors carrying the relevant shRNA sequences, followed by drug selection. The 
104  shPML short-hairpin RNA sequences that we used were: Sh0:5'-AGATGCAGCTGTATCCAAG-3'[15], Sh1: 
105  5'-GCTGTATCCAAGAAAGCCA-3', sh2: 5-CCAACAACATCTTCTGCTCC-3’ were cloned into the lentiviral 
106  vector pLKO.1 (Addgene #8453)[16]. Knockdown (KD) was evaluated by western blot and/or mRNA 
107  analysis using suitable primers.  
108  2.2.Plasmids, DNA, and siRNA transfections 
109  Plasmids  with  PMLIV,  PMLIII  and  PMLI  isoforms  have  been  previously  described  [17].  For 
110  immunoprecipitation and localization experiments the PMLIV, PMLIII and PMLI isoforms were fused to 
111  the mRED vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). TWIST1, TWIST2, SNAIL1 (Addgene #16225[18]) 
112  and SLUG (Addgene #25696) were fused to GFP-C (Clontech). mCherry LEGO-C2 was provided by Dr. 
113  K.Weber. The 5xHREVEGFLuc reporter was provided by Dr. S. Simos. The CD24-Luc was constructed by 
114  cloning  the  -1700  to  +79bp  (PCR  amplified  using  CD24  forward  5'-

116  primers)  of  the  CD24  promoter  upstream  of  the  pGL3luc  reporter.  Transient  transfections  were 
117  performed using the calcium phosphate method or Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
118  Waltham,  MA,  USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer's  instructions.  The  lentivirus  production  and 
119  infection protocol have been previously described in detail[19]. 
120  2.3.Tumor Sphere Forming assay 
121  For  tumorsphere  forming  assays  cells  were  cultured  in  DMEM-F12  1:1  (Gibco,  Waltham, 
122  Massachusetts, USA) containing B27 (1:50), bFGF (20ng/ml), EGF (20ng/ml) and 0.2% methylcellulose 
123  at 1000 cells/ml using in ultra-low attachment plates. After 8 days, spheres of ≥ 70μm size were 
124  enumerated and if required were dispersed by accutase and cells were counted for next passage.  
125  2.4.RNA extraction and qRT-PCR 
126  Total RNA extraction was performed using Nucleozol (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Next, 2μg RNA was 
127  used to generate library cDNAs using the enzyme M‐MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (New England, 
128  Biolabs,  USA)  together  with  an  RNase  inhibitor  (New  England,  Biolabs,  USA)  according  to  the 
129  manufacturer's protocol. The relative abundance of each gene transcript was measured by qRT-PCR 
130  using the dye SYBR Green I (Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Relative mRNA expression was 
131  calculated after normalization against β-actin or GAPDH levels. Set of primers used for qRT-PCR are 
132  listed in Suppl. Materials file. 
133  2.5.RNA sequencing 
134  Total RNA was isolated from control cells and PML KD using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For the MDA-MB-231 
135  samples, the mRNA 3'-UTR sequence method was used to create libraries with the QuantSeq 3'mRNA-
136  Seq Library Prep Kit for Ion Torrent-Cat #012. And the sequencing was done with Ion S5, with Ion 540 
137  Reagents. NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina-E7760 and NEBNext Poly (A) 
138  mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module-E7490 were used for libraries for complete RNA sequencing of MCF7 
139  cells. Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500 Illumina with FlowCell High 1x75. HISAT2 version 
140  2.1 (genome mapper) 
141  2.6.Analysis of differentially expressed genes 
142  Differential gene expression analysis was performed with ΜetaseqR. The functional analysis was 
143  performed using the web tool gProfileR[20] and Metascape[21] 
144  2.7.Western-Blot Analysis 
145  Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% 
146  NP‐40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; 
147  Sigma), and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of cell lysates 
148  were subjected to SDS/PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. The primary antibodies used for WB are 
149  listed in Suppl. Materials file.

150  2.8.Protein immunoprecipitation (Immunoprecipitation-IP) 
151  Immunoprecipitation of protein complexes was performed, using HEK293T cell extracts following 
152  overexpression of specific proteins for possible interaction and prepared by RIPA cell lysis buffer as 
153  described above. 200μg of protein extracts were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. 
154  The following day, 20 uL of protein G beads was added to each sample after washing with IP buffer (25 
155  mm Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), and reactions were incubated at 4 °C for three additional hours. 
156  Non-specific proteins were washed away three times with NETN buffer (10mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 250mm 
157  NaCl, 5mm EDTA, 0.5% NP‐40, 1mm PMSF). SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were 
158  boiled prior to SDS/PAGE analysis. Input lanes represent 10% of the lysate used for the IP. 
159  2.9.FACs analysis 
160  Flow cytometry was used to evaluate CD24 and CD44 surface expression (FACs calibour by Becton 
161  Dickinson (BD) (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). The cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and 
162  following centrifugation were suspended in PBS-2% FCS-0.1% NaN3 with specific antibodies of isotype 
163  controls.  
164  2.10.Transwell migration assay 
165  For migration assays, cells were seeded into Millicell, Cell culture 8μm inserts (Merck KGaA, Germany) 
166  in FBS-free medium overlaying the lower compartment filled with FBs-containing media. The next day, 
167  the upper side cells were scraped away and the insert was fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with crystal 
168  violet (Merck) and counted under a microscope. The percentage of cells that has passed through the 
169  membrane in relation to the total number of cells seeded on the transwell is indicative of the migrating 
170  capacity of the cells.  
171  2.11.Immunostaining and microscopy 
172  Cells for immunostaining were cultured on 8-well chamber, removable (80841, Ibidi GmbH, Germany) 
173  and fixed in buffered 4% PFA / 1XPBS for 5 minutes at room temperature, permeated with 0.5% Triton 
174  X-100/1XPBS for 5 minutes and rinsed repeatedly with 1XPBS. The samples were then incubated with 
175  1% BSA/1XPBS for 1 hour before incubation with primary antibodies overnight or 1 hour. After washing 
176  with PBS, secondary antibody was added to the samples for one hour. The secondary antibody was 
177  washed again three times with PBS and the cell nuclei were then counter stained with DAPI (Merck). 
178  Epifluorescence microscopy was done in an inverted Olympus IX70 and Confocal microscopy was done 
179  in a Zeiss Axioscope 2 Plus microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 laser scanning system 
180  and Lasersharp 2000 imaging software and a Leica SP8 inverted focus microscope and analyzed with 
181  the Leica Application Suite (Las, Leica, Germany) software. Autopsied animals were examined under a 
182  Leica M205FA fluorescent stereomicroscope, carrying a Leica DFC310FX camera and analysed with 
183  Leica Application Suite (Las) software.

184  2.12.Immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections 
185  Tissues isolated from experimental animals were fixed with 10% formalin (Merck) and kept overnight 
186  at 4° C. They were then washed 3 times with sterile PBS and placed in 70% sterile ethanol (analytical 
187  grade). They were then placed in a sequential dehydration and paraffinization machine and finally the 
188  tissues were placed in paraffin to be cut into a microtome and stained with hematoxylin-eosin as 
189  described in a previous study[22]. If required, sections were stained with antibody CD31 (AbCAM, 
190  Cambridge,UK) and stained area was measured with ImageJ as percentage of Microvessel density.  
191  2.13.In vivo experiments on experimental animals 
192  Tumor Xenografting was done in NOD-scid IL2R gamma null (NSG) mice. In the case of MCF7 cells, β-
193  estradiol (8μg / ml) was added to the water and was being replaced every 5 days until termination of 
194  the experiment. Tumor volume was estimated using the formula V = ½ (Length × Width2)[23]. To better 
195  monitor the engrafted tumour cells, control and KD PML cells were previously modified to express the 
196  red fluorescent mCherry protein. Equal cell numbers from either group were injected subcutaneously 
197  into NSG mice and measurements from the growing primary tumors were taken every four days. When 
198  tumors reached 1200mm3 in size, mice were sacrificed.  
199  2.14.Approval of animal experiments 
200  All procedures were conducted according to Greek national legislations and institutional policies 
201  following  approval  by  the  FORTH  ethical  committee.  NSG  mice  were  purchased  from  Jackson 
202  Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and were maintained and bred at the Institute of Molecular 
203  Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB) animal facility following the institutional guidelines based on the 
204  Greek  ethical  committee  of  animal  experimentation.  Current  procedures  were  approved  by  the 
205  General Directorate of Veterinary Services, Region of Crete (license number: 93304 and 106336.) 
206  2.15.Statistical analysis 
207  The statistics was performed with Microsoft EXCEL software, XLSTAT and Graphpad Prism. Values 
208  were presented as the mean ±SD from two or more experiments. For comparisons the two tailed t-test, 
209  Mann-Whitney or χ2 tests were performed as descrided in results.  
210  3.RESULTS 
211  3.1.Silencing of PML affects tumor cell morphology and physiology 
212  To dissect the role of PML in breast cancer we initially employed a Doxycycline inducible shRNA 
213  approach that resulted in 50-55% reduction of the various PML isoforms. Thus we switched to a 
214  constitutive knock down approach by testing three different shRNAs for PML silencing in MDA-MB-231 
215  and MCF7 cells. Knock down (KD) efficiency was verified by qRTPCR (not shown), immunostaining and 
216  western blotting using an antibody against a region common to all PML isoforms (Fig.1A) and cell pools 
217  with more than 80% PML protein reduction were chosen for further experimentation.

229  Microscopic examination of control and KD cells showed moderate changes of cell morphology in 
230  sparse cultures, towards a more spindle–like shape of MDA-MB-231 (Fig.1B). Similarly, MCF7 acquired 
231  a less tight epithelial cell-to-cell adhesion pattern. PML silencing slightly increased the proliferation of 
232  MDA-MB-231 and to a larger extend MCF7 in agreement with reduced expression of the cyclin kinase 
233  inhibitor p21 protein (Fig.1C). We next tested the impact of PML ablation on cells grown in 3D as 
234  tumour spheres. Parental MCF7 and claudin-low MDA-MB-231 formed compact -round and grape-like 
235  spheres respectively[24]. The MCF7-PML KD spheres assumed a more loose morphology that tends to 
236  resemble those of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.1D). Most importantly the sphere forming efficiency of MDA-
237  MB-231 –PML KD cells, but not that of MCF7 cells was reduced to about 30% of the control cells 
238  (Fig.1D). 
239  We have shown previously that PML is essential for maintaining the epithelial characteristics of 
240  naïve mouse embryonic stem cells[8]. The MDA-MB-231 cell line has mesenchymal characteristics, 
241  expressing high levels of VIMENTIN compared to MCF7 (Fig.2A/middle). Conversely, MCF7 express high 
242  levels of  the  epithelial marker  CDH1  as compared  to MDA-MD-231  cells.  Following  PML  KD we 
243  observed a decrease of CDH1 RNA in both MDA–MB-231 and MCF7 cells (Fig 2A/left). At the protein 
244  level, the VIMENTIN expression was slightly increased in the former whereas the CDH1 was decreased 
245  in the latter cells (Fig.2A/Right). MDA-MB-231 cells express high levels of the mesenchymal marker 
246  CD44 and intermediate levels of the epithelial marker CD24, a phenotype early on linked to high 
247  tumour initiating (or cancer stem cell) ability of patients-derived breast cancer xenografts[25]. Flow 
248  cytometry analysis for those surface markers showed that PML loss minimally affected CD24 or CD44 
249  expression in MCF7 cells. However, PMLKD in MDA-MB-231, led to a reduction of the CD24+ population 
250  (Fig.2B) and lower CD24 RNA expression (Fig.6D). To further assess the epithelial/mesenchymal cell 
251  properties we used an in vitro transwell assay, and found that the absence of PML led to increased 
252  migration capacity of MDA-MB-231 and to a lesser extend MCF7 cells (Fig.2C). Moreover the amount of 
253  phosphorylated  STAT3  protein,  known  to  correlate  with  TNBC  aggressive  behaviour[26,27],  was 
254  increased (Fig.2D).  
255  Thus,  PML  loss  seems  to  intensify  the  existing  mesenchymal  phenotype  while  reducing  the 
256  epithelial phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas in MCF7 cells, leads to a decrease of the CDH1 
257  epithelial marker without inducing mesenchymal marker expression. Because epithelial-mesenchymal 
258  transition (EMT) transcription factors (EMT-TFs) are mediators of the above phenotypic changes, we 
259  measured RNA levels of TWIST1 and TWIST2 key EMT factors and observed that PML loss caused a 
260  significant increase of TWIST2 expression at the RNA (Fig.3A) and protein level (Fig.6E). In line with this, 
261  the TCGA breast cancer (Metabric) data set [28] show a strong inverse correlation of RNA expression 
262  between PML and TWIST2 (Fig. 3B).

271  To further study the relationship of PML and EMT factors, PML-mCherry fusions and EMT factor-GFP 
272  fusions of TWIST1, TWIST2, SNAIL1 AND SLUG (SNAIL2) were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. PMLIV 
273  strongly co-localize with all EMT factors especially with TWIST2 and SLUG (Fig.3C), whereas PML III or 
274  PML I isoform did not (Suppl. Fig S1). A strong physical interaction of EMT factors and PML was further 
275  confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs). Figure 3D shows results from a representative co-IP 
276  using PMLIV. To define the region involved in the protein–protein interaction, we expressed TWIST2 
277  truncations along with PMLIV followed by confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal 
278  results showed localization with the central region of TWIST2 that includes the bHLH. Indeed the HLH 
279  region alone (aa64 to aa124) showed a strong co-IP signal whereas the N- or C-terminal parts had 
280  minimal or no interaction ability (Suppl. Fig S2).

288  3.2.Changes in gene expression induced by PML ablation in breast cancer cells  
289  To  correlate  the  above  changes  in  cell  behaviour  with  potential  effects  of  PML  loss  in  gene 
290  expression,  we  performed  transcriptomic  analyses  of  control and  PML  KD  cell  lines.  Specifically, 
291  silencing of PML deregulated about 600 genes at the 1.5 fold cut-off in MDA-MB-231 cells. Upregulated 
292  genes were enriched in cell cycle and cell division, whereas down- regulated genes showed enrichment 
293  in cell adhesion functions, Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and microRNAs that target tumour 
294  suppressors (Fig.4). A similar analysis of control and PML KD MCF7 cells identified 736 down- and 256 
295  up-regulated genes. Upregulated genes were enriched in differentiation, morphogenesis, locomotion, 
296  and cell adhesion terms that involve NFKB1, RELA, and HIF1A factors while down regulated genes 
297  involve ECM organisation and cytokine signalling.Validation of deregulated expression for a number of 
298  those genes was done by qRT-PCR analysis (Suppl. Fig S3).  
299  Comparisons of the two cell types showed little overlap in deregulated genes indicating a cellular 
300  context-specific  response  to  PML  loss.  Common  GO  terms  were  related  to  stress  response  and 
301  developmental processes.

308  3.3.PML  affects  growth  and  hypoxic  response  of  tumors  derived  from  MDA-MB-231 
309  xenografted cells. 
310  To study and correlate the above results with the in vivo tumor growth of PML-silenced cells, we 
311  performed engraftment in NSG mice. PML loss led to an increase of the tumour growth rate in MDA-
312  MB-231 cells, but not MCF7 cells (Fig.5A). Histology of primary MDA-MB-231 KD PML tumour sites 
313  showed reduced necrosis relative to control group (Fig.5B). To test whether reduced necrosis might be 
314  due to enhanced vascularization we used anti CD31 antibody staining in sections of primary site 
315  tumors. PML KD tumors showed significantly higher microvessel density relative to the control group 
316  (Fig.5C). To further study these cells after their in vivo passage, we readapted tumor tissue back into 
317  cell culture and developed more than 16 lines from primary or metastastic sites. We examined the 
318  basal and (desferrioxamine) DFO induced HIF1A protein of parental and xeno-derived lines and found 
319  that PML KD had a 2 fold higher basal HI1A expression that was further intensified following in vivo 
320  growth  (Fig.5D).  Luciferase  assays  by  transient  transfection  of  the  5xHRE  luc  hypoxia  response 
321  corroborated these results (Fig.5E right) PML loss resulted in a similar increase of HIF1A RNA and VEGF-
322  α, a target of HIF1a and a main angiogenic factor, in both the parental and xeno-derived PML KD lines, 
323  (Fig.5E left). In agreement Inspection of clinical breast cancer data from TCGA–Metabric, showed a 
324  striking inverse correlation of PML and HIF1a (Fig.5F). Taken together these results suggest that PML 
325  loss facilitates HIF1A RNA expression to promote the acquisition of a hypoxic phenotype that is further 
326  enhanced in a hypoxic primary site relative to the lung metastatic growths. Because HIF1a is well 
327  known to be regulated at the protein stability level we next studied protein turn over in control and 
328  PML KD cells first induced with DFO and next with Cycloheximide (CHX). Similarly to basal HIF1A 
329  protein levels, DFO-mediated inhibition of degradation resulted in a proportional two fold increase in 
330  both parental and xeno-derived, either control or PML KD lines. A follow up inhibition of protein 
331  synthesis by cycloheximide showed that PML loss did not affect the protein degradation rate (about 
332  80min half-life). Overall the above indicate that PML loss promotes Hypoxia response by mainly 
333  affecting both the RNA and protein expression but not turn over (Fig.5G).

353  3.4.The ablation of PML regulates the metastatic potential and organ preference of MDA-
354  MB-231 cells. 
355  Gross observation and stereomicroscopy of autopsied tumor bearing mice showed that all (7/7) the 
356  PML KD expressing, MDA-MB-231 tumours, had a more intense metastatic load relative to controls in 
357  all the organs examined. More specifically all PML KD mice had many more lung metastatic foci, 6/7 
358  were positive for liver metastases, 4/7 showed metastases in the axillary glands and one (1/7) showed 
359  metastasis to the bone marrow (Fig.6A) compared with tumors from control mice. These were further 
360  confirmed and quantified by stereomicroscopy and histology of axillary lymph node, liver, kidney and 
361  lung  samples.  Of  note,  lung  was  the  most  extensively  affected  site  observed  (Fig.6B,C)  with  an 
362  estimated 10 fold higher metastatic load in the PML KD (see also Fig.7A). MCF7 control or PML KD 
363  tumors showed no significantly different growth rate and no metastasis were found in either group 
364  (Suppl. Fig. S5). All PML control and KD lines derived from tumor tissue retained differential expression 
365  of PML RNA, and protein, similar to their parental cell lines (Suppl. Fig S4). Interestingly,MDA-MB-
366  231PML KD cells or tumor –derived lines had increased TWIST2 protein expression (Fig.6E). In addition, 
367  they showed higher expression levels of recurrence-metastasis related markers, such as EpCAM[29] 
368  and CD49f [30] (Suppl. fig S4) and reduced epithelial CD24 RNA levels (Fig.6D).Using a transiently 
369  expressed CD24-Luc reporter we found that cotransfected TWIST2 reduced and expression of PML IV 
370  rescued luciferase activity (Fig.6F). Taken together, these results suggest that PML KD cells are enriched 
371  in mesenchymal properties consistent with a pro-metastatic phenotype because PML antagonises EMT 
372  factors by acting at both the RNA expression and protein function levels.

384  The increased lung metastatic ability of MDA-MB-231PML KD derived tumour lines (Fig.7A) was

386  signature genes [14], namely ID1 and FSCN1, using the original and tumor derived cell lines we found 
387  that PML KD derived cells had higher expression than their parental cell lines (Fig.7B). Because results 
388  of tumor sphere formation (TSF) ability seemed not to be in line with in vivo tumor growth, we chose to 
389  examine in more detail the TSF ability of parental and tumor derived MDA–MB-231 cell lines under 
390  normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Results from these experiments show that passage one (P1) PML KD 
391  from either parental or tumor derived lines, had a lower TSF ability (20-30%) than controls, under 
392  either normoxic or hypoxic (3% oxygen) conditions, although in the latter a general increase of TSF was 
393  found. However, during subsequent passages the TSF ability of PML KD cells increased whereas that of 
394  the control groups decreased. At P3, parental, primary tumor and lung derived PML KD cells exceeded 
395  their controls in pair wise comparisons (Fig.7D).

405  4.DISCUSSION 
406  To investigate the role of PML in breast cancer we produced Knock Down lines of the claudin-low 
407  MDA-MB-231 and the luminal-A MCF7 and studied their physiology and transcriptomic profiles.  
408  Our  previous  studies  have  shown  that  induced  overexpression  of  PMLIV  in  MDA-MB-231  cells 
409  strongly inhibited cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation (TSF) ability[11]. While PML silencing 
410  of all PML isoforms in those cell types caused a slight increase of the cell growth rate in monolayer 
411  culture, yet their tumor sphere ability was compromised (25-30% of the control line) implying a role for 
412  PML in their maintenance of stem cell like properties. In addition, PML loss changed the MCF7 tumor 
413  spheres from their known smooth spherical morphology[24] to a more grape one, reflecting a change 
414  in the expression of cell–cell interacting proteins. The ablation of PML caused a shift in both cell line 
415  towards  a  more  mesenchymal  appearance  that  has  been  previously  linked  to  increased  cell 
416  invasiveness[31,32] and tumor recurrence or metastasis[33,34]. In accordance with this, PML deficient 
417  cells showed increased migration capacities. The increase in migration activity was more pronounced in 
418  MDA MB 231 cells and correlated with higher phosphorylated Stat3[35].  
419  To  correlate  these  changes  with  RNA  expression  profiles,  we  report  here  for  the  first  time  a 
420  transcriptomic analysis upon silencing of PML. The transcriptomic analysis reflected the differences in 
421  the physiology of these cell types. The ablation of PML in MDA-MB-231 cells caused the repression of 
422  genes related to cell adhesion and ECM. On the other hand, genes related to cell cycle, mitosis and cell 
423  division were upregulated. A similar analysis in MCF7 cells identified developmental–differentiation 
424  related genes to be upregulated and cytokine and extracellular matrix related genes to be repressed 
425  upon PML KD. Interestingly, earlier studies of transient PML KD in HUVEC cells identified some common 
426  GO enriched classes such as cell cycle and locomotion[36].  
427  Together the phenotype and deregulated gene expression profile suggest that PML deficient MDA-
428  MB-231 cells are expected to be more aggressive than their parental cells. This contrasts with the 
429  reduction in TSF that is thought to measure of tumor initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cell activity. 
430  To clarify this we xenografted control and PML KD cells in NSG mice and monitored their growth in the 
431  primary site and development of metastasis. PML KD did not affect significantly the local tumor growth 
432  or the non/low metastatic properties of MCF7 cells. However, MDA-MB-231 KD PML cells developed 
433  tumors faster when compared with the controls. This observation contradicts the in vitro TSF assay 
434  suggesting that the growth defect in PML loss can be reversed during in vivo tumor growth. Indeed, 
435  upon sequential tumor sphere passaging, PML KD cells showed a gradual increase of their TSF ability 
436  concomitant with a decrease of the control TSF. These results show that PML KD cells retain higher 
437  long-term TSF ability especially when taken from primary tumor sites and/or hypoxic conditions in 
438  agreement with their higher in vivo tumor growth rate and metastasis. Taken together these results 
439  suggest that PML KD cells acquire higher TIC properties in vivo and show a more aggressive phenotype. 
440  Tissue  hypoxia  seems  to  further  intensify  this  process.  These  results  partly  disagree,  with  the 
441  observations of Ponente et al.[37], Martin-Martin et al.[38] And Arreal et al.[39] that describe a pro-
442  oncogenic role of PML in breast cancer. Although presently undetermined these differences may be 
443  caused by distinct MDA-MB-231 subline differences or the effect of long term and strong PML silencing

444  in our lines. 
445  EMT factors is a large family of proteins with important roles in normal development often found to 
446  be deregulated in cancer[40] in response to upstream activators[41]. The role of interaction of PML 
447  with EMT factors seems to be complex. Cytoplasmic PML promotes EMT via potentiation of TGF b 
448  signaling[42,43]. We described here for the first time that both bHLH (TWIST) and Zn-finger (SNAIL) 
449  type EMT factors bind and co-localize to PML IV and to a lesser extent to PML I and III driven nuclear 
450  bodies. Interaction with TWIST2 requires the presence of the bHLH domain and may result in altered 
451  dimerization or DNA binding in a way similar to the inhibitory action of IDs on EMT actors. Functionally 
452  PML overexpression reverses the inhibition of TWIST2 on the CD24 promoter. In addition, PML KD 
453  leads to increased TWIST2 RNA and protein expression in parental tumors and the lung metastases in 
454  line with a strong inverse correlation of PML and TWIST2 expression in a large breast data set (TCGA-
455  Metabric).  
456  An important observation of this study was the increased metastatic properties of PML deficient 
457  MDA-MB-231 cells to various sites and a stronger preference for the development of lung metastasis. 
458  Earlier studies have identified a group of genes in MDA-MB-231 cells expressed at higher levels in cell 
459  lines derived from lung metastases (lung metastasis signature, LMS) relative to their parental cell 
460  line[14]. The differentially expressed PML KD genes and the LMS list (shown in suppl. Table S1) contain 
461  11 common genes (Shown in Suppl. Table S2). Interestingly FSCN1 and ID1 showed a change in their 
462  expression pattern resembling that of LMS. The ID gene family has important roles in development and 
463  their deregulated expression is connected to poor prognosis. Increased expression of ID1 has been 
464  associated with both primary tumor formation and lung colonization[44] presumably via mesenchymal 
465  -epithelial transition essential for the latter process[45]. Earlier studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-
466  231 are genetically heterogeneous and in vitro selection for more aggressive populations with altered 
467  genome structure have been reported[46]. Similarly, sequential in vivo growth of MDA-MB-231 selects 
468  for highly metastatic sublines enriched in pre-existing or newly arising genetic variants such as BRAF 
469  and KRAS[47] as well as ALPK2 and RYR1[48] that correlate with high organ specific metastatic ability. 
470  Although not directly demonstrated it is likely that PML deficiency accelerates this in vivo selection 
471  process. In the present studies, PML affected both the primary and metastatic tumor growth. Searching 
472  for metastatic suppressor genes (MSG) we found that the ablation of PML resulted in the up - or down 
473  regulation of a small number of MSGs[49]. but their functional significance remains to be determined. 
474  Tumors produced by MDA-MB-231 PML KD cells showed lower necrotic content suggesting higher 
475  vascular supply. In agreement with this, CD31 immunocytochemistry showed significant increase of 
476  microvessel density in PML KD primary tumors. In agreement with this, parental- or lines generated by 
477  culturing PML KD tumors expressed higher levels of HIF1a protein and its target, VEGFα that may 
478  account for a higher tumor angiogenic activity. We show here that PML loss enhanced HIF1A and 
479  consequently VEGF RNA expression without affecting the protein turn over unlike its role in promoting 
480  HIF1A protein synthesis in a mouse KO model. [50]. Because HIF1A is mainly regulated at the protein 
481  level understanding of its transcriptional regulation is less well studied. Nevertheless there is evidence 
482  of various regulatory pathways that can activate HIF transcription[51] including STAT3[52]. Strikingly,

483  we have observed STAT3 activation in the PML KD -MDA MB231 cells. PML is a known IFN inducible 
484  gene[53]. Moreover STAT3 KD down-regulates PML[38]. Conversely, PML blocks STAT3 via direct 
485  binding [54] and blocking its IL6-mediated activation[55]. In addition PML loss prolongs nuclear STAT3 
486  life[56]. Thus PML stands in the middle of a negative feedback n network with cytokines/IFNs and 
487  STAT3. Importantly STAT3 regulates both EMT and HIF1A [52] and may also activate angiogenic target 
488  genes either acting alone or in a network with HIF1a[57]. Among others, STAT3 induces TWIST2 
489  expression[58]. These results suggest that STAT3 may be the common culprit that promotes both 
490  EMT/migration  and  HIF/angiogenesis  to  generate  a  higher  metastastic  load.  Unrestrained  STAT3 
491  activity in PML deficiency facilitates both EMT and angiogenic signaling for in PML enhanced aggression 
492  and metastasis of TNBC cells.  
493  5.Conclusions 
494  Collectively PML impedes tumorigenicity by regulating the mesenchymal-invasive and angiogenic 
495  properties and the metastatic tropism of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition PML may control the long 
496  term survival of TICs. Finally, PML loss may accelerate in vivo evolution of genetically heterogeneous 
497  population to acquire a more aggressive-metastatic phenotype. Mechanistically this is linked to the 
498  long term maintenance of tumor initiating cells, potentiation of their mesenchymal phenotype and a 
499  hypoxia-angiogenic switch. Hence, PML expression may serve as a valuable cancer biomarker.
