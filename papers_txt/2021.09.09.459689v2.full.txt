Abstract 
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most lethal and treatment-resistant breast cancer subtype 
with limited treatment options. We previously identified a protein complex unique to TNBC cancer stem cells 
composed of the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26), the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG, and 
focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We sought to determine whether a peptide mimetic of Cx26 designed to target 
the complex attenuated tumor growth in pre-clinical models. Histological assessment was employed to verify 
expression  of  complex  members.  We  designed  peptides  based  on  Cx26  juxtamembrane  domains  and 
performed binding experiments with NANOG and FAK using surface plasmon resonance. Peptides with high 
affinity were engineered with a cell-penetrating sequence and assessed in functional assays including cell 
proliferation, self-renewal, and in vivo tumor growth, and downstream signaling changes were measured. 
Binding studies revealed that the Cx26 C-terminal tail and intracellular loop bound to NANOG and FAK with 
submicromolar-to-micromolar affinity and that a 5-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal tail of Cx26 (RYCSG) 
was sufficient for binding. The Cx26 C-terminal tail was tagged with an antennapedia cell-penetrating peptide 
sequence  and  intracellular  localization  was  confirmed.  The  cell-penetrating  Cx26  peptide  (aCx26-pep) 
disrupted self-renewal as assessed by tumorsphere formation assay while reducing nuclear FAK and NANOG 
and inhibiting NANOG target gene expression in TNBC cells but not luminal mammary epithelial cells. In vivo, 
aCx26-pep reduced tumor growth and proliferation and induced cell death. We provide proof-of-concept that a 
Cx26 peptide-based strategy inhibits growth and alters NANOG activity in TNBC.

Introduction 
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, is associated with high 
rates of recurrence and metastasis1-5. To date, unlike other breast cancer subtypes, no specific targeted 
approaches exist for TNBC, and toxic chemotherapeutic agents are the primary treatment regimen, highlighting 
the need to develop new targeted therapies. TNBC contains a high degree of cellular heterogeneity and 
plasticity that has emerged as a hallmark of the malignant state and accounts for the observed persistent 
tumor growth, therapeutic resistance, and metastasis6-9. TNBC also contains self-renewing, therapeutically 
resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are responsible for tumor progression and metastasis10-13. Given the 
limited treatment options for TNBC, CSC neutralizing strategies are an immediate priority for therapeutic 
development.    
Attempts to elucidate the complexity of CSC maintenance have focused on intrinsic driver mutations and 
altered developmental signaling pathways14. The elevated cellular density within tumors stimulates cellular 
programs that are activated by cell-cell contact and close proximity. The gap junction family of proteins is 
composed of connexin subunits and canonically functions in gap junction plaques at the interface of adjacent 
cells  to  facilitate  direct  cell-cell  communication.  Connexins  can  also  function  non-canonically  as  single 
membrane channels (hemichannels, which contain a single assembled connexon hexamer of connexins) or as 
signaling hubs adjacent to any organelle and/or the plasma membrane15. In cancer, the classical role of 
connexins  as  tumor  suppressors  has  been  widely  described  in  many  tumor  models16-20.  However,  the 
paradigm that connexins have a global tumor-suppressive role has been challenged by recent evidence that 
connexins can be pro-tumorigenic by facilitating tumor progression and metastasis21-27. The connexin subunits 
involved in maintaining homeostasis during the physiological development and function of the mammary gland 
are Cx26 and Cx4318, 28. In breast cancer, connexins have been described to be both pro- and anti-tumorigenic 
by regulating transformation, proliferation, cell survival, and metastasis27. Most studies to date suggest a 
tumor-suppressive role for Cx26 early in breast cancer progression based on evidence that Cx26 is frequently 
absent or down-regulated in human breast cancer cell lines and human primary tumors15, 29-31. However, these 
studies are inconsistent with clinical observations that demonstrate a strong correlation between increased 
Cx26  expression  in  breast  cancer  tissue  samples  post-treatment  (chemotherapy/surgery)  and  decreased

overall survival32. Moreover, Cx26 expression has been shown to be associated with increased lymphatic 
vessel invasion, increased tumor size, and poor prognosis in human breast cancers32, 33.  
We  previously  demonstrated  that  Cx26  is  elevated  in  TNBC  compared  to  normal  mammary  tissue  and 
enriched in CSCs compared to their non-CSC progeny in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft 
models34. In functional studies, we demonstrated that Cx26 is necessary and sufficient for CSC maintenance 
and regulates NANOG protein stability. In TNBC, Cx26 localizes to an intracellular membrane-bound vesicle in 
complex with the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In contrast to its 
role in the normal mammary epithelium, Cx26 functions in a gap junction-independent manner in TNBC by 
forming an intracellular complex that underlies the maintenance of CSC function and stabilizes NANOG. We 
leveraged these initial findings to develop a peptide-based strategy to disrupt this novel signaling network. We 
developed peptides to the intracellular and extracellular regions of Cx26 and identified the binding domains 
necessary for interaction with NANOG and FAK. Using a cell-penetrating peptide strategy, we show that 
introduction  of  the  Cx26  C-terminus  into  TNBC  cells  inhibits  self-renewal,  reduces  NANOG  target  gene 
expression, and attenuates in vivo tumor growth. Together, this study provides proof-of-concept that targeting 
CSCs via connexin peptide mimetics represents a viable therapeutic strategy for TNBC.

Materials and Methods 
Study Approvals 
All mouse procedures were performed under adherence to protocols approved by the Institute Animal Care 
and Use Committee at the Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic (#2018-2101). All human specimens 
were obtained under adherence to protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Institutional Review 
Board (IRB approval #17-418).  
TNBC Cx26, FAK, and NANOG Histology and Analysis 
Annotated cases of invasive ductal carcinoma were retrieved from the surgical pathology files of Cleveland 
Clinic and included triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC), hormone receptor positive (HR+ being estrogen 
receptor positive) and HER2 negative (HR+/HER2-), hormone receptor negative (HR- being estrogen receptor 
negative) and HER2 positive (HR-/HER2+) or hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (HR+/HER2+). In 
total, 12 TNBC, 12 HR+/HER2-, 5 HR-/HER2+, 4 HR+/HER2+ tumors were evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin 
stained slides were reviewed for invasive tumor adequacy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 
μ
4- m thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) whole tissue serial sections following antigen retrieval 
(Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.1; Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Immunostains performed included Connexin 26 
(Cx26)  mouse  monoclonal  antibody  (clone  CX-12H10,  Thermo  Fisher  Scientific, Waltham,  MA)  at  1:200 
dilution, NANOG rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone EPR2027, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:250 dilution, and 
FAK rabbit polyclonal antibody (clone Q05397, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA ) at 1:500 dilution.  All 
staining was performed on an automated platform (Ventana Benchmark, Ultraview  XT, Ventana Medical 
Systems,  Inc,  Tucson,  AZ)  and  visualized  with  ultraView  universal  DAB  detection  kit  (Ventana  Medical 
Systems, Inc, Tucson, AZ).  The cellular compartment staining (membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear) was 
evaluated and the intensity in each case for the three antibodies was characterized as weak, moderate, or 
strong, and the extent of immunoreactivity scored according to the percentage of tumor cells with staining: 0 
(0%), 1+ (<5%), 2+ (5–25%), 3+ (26–50%), 4+ (51–75%), and 5+ (76–100%).

‐ ‐
MDA MB 231, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, and MCF7 breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection; 
‐
Manassas,  VA)  were  cultured  in  log growth  phase  in  Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle's  medium  (DMEM) 
‐
supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Cellgro, Kansas City, MO) and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf 
serum (FCS) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO ). All cell lines were authenticated through the

Cleveland  Clinic  Lerner  Research  Institute  Cell  Culture  Core  and  routinely  tested  for  mycoplasma 
contamination. The NANOG-GFP reporter was described previously, and cells were sorted for GFPhi and 
GFPlo populations as described35.  
Peptide Synthesis and Validation 
All peptides, unless otherwise noted, were synthesized by the LRI Molecular Biotechnology Core through 
standard solid-phase chemistry, using Rink Amide resin and side chain-protected Fmoc-amino acids, on a 
Liberty Blue Automated Microwave Peptide Synthesizer (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC). Each peptide was 
(cid:2) (cid:2)
purified to > 95% by acetonitrile gradient elution (20 - 50%) on a Vydac preparative C18 column, using 
reverse-phase HPLC (Waters Corporation). The quality of the peptide was analyzed by HPLC (Agilent 1100) 
on a reverse-phase analytical C-18 column. The correct mass corresponding to the amino acid composition of 
each peptide was then confirmed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer; Model No. 
4800; AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA). The peptides were lyophilized and stored at -80°C until reconstituted in 
1% DMSO/PBS. 
3D protein structure prediction 
AlphaFold2  was  used  to  predict  the  3D  structure  of  Cx26,  NANOG  and  FAK:

Images were rendered using Visual Molecular Dynamics software36. 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis 
The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between synthesized Cx26 cytosolic tail peptides and either 
NANOG or FAK proteins were determined using the Biacore S200 (Cytiva, USA) at 25°C. The 1% DMSO/1x 
PBS-P+ (Cytiva) buffer was filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane filter and degassed immediately before the

experiment as running buffer with a flow rate of 30 µL/min for the instrument system. The purified active 
NANOG was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate solution pH 4.5, resulting in a protein concentration of 50 µg/mL, 
and  purified  active  FAK  was  diluted  in  10  mM  sodium  acetate  solution  pH  5.0,  resulting  in  a  protein 
concentration of 20 µg/mL. The diluted protein was immobilized on the surface of a Series S Sensor Chip CM5 
via the primary amine group, employing a standard Amine Coupling Kit (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5), and 
the target immobilization level was 5000 response units (RUs). The flow cell 1 without any modification was 
used as a reference to correct for system error. The RU values were collected, and all the binding affinity data 
were calculated by kinetic models (1:1 Langmuir interaction) within the Biacore S200 Evaluation Software. To 
determine the binding affinity between each peptide and NANOG or FAK, a series of peptide dilutions was 
analyzed by multi-cycle kinetics/affinity. A concentration gradient of each peptide as the analyte was freshly 
prepared in running buffer over at least five concentrations (100 nM – 100 µM). Each peptide at various 
gradient concentrations (including a repeat concentration) and one zero concentration (running buffer) flowed 
over the immobilized NANOG or FAK, with 180 s for binding, followed by disassociation for 600 s, and the 
obtained RUs were recorded. After the injection of each concentration of each peptide, the sensor chip surface 
was regenerated with 10 mM glycine pH 2.5 for 30 s to completely remove the residual peptide. The KD was 
calculated to evaluate the ability of peptides to interact with NANOG or FAK proteins. 
Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry Analysis of Antp-peptides 
‐ ‐
Following peptide treatment, MDA MB 231 cells were lifted and washed in 1x PBS followed by staining with UV 
Live/Dead  dye  (1:1000,  Thermo  Scientific)  for  15  min  at  room  temperature.  Cells  were  then  fixed  and 
permeabilized using the Annexin V Staining Kit (BD Biosciences) per the manufacturer’s instructions and 
incubated  with  FITC-conjugated  anti-antennapedia  (anti-Antp-FITC)  antibody  (1:100,  LSBio)  for  30  min. 
Samples were washed and analyzed using a BD Fortessa flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed using 
the FlowJo software v10 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). 
For immunofluorescence staining, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with Geltrex 
(ThermoFisher) in 24-well plates and treated with aCx26-pep (10 µM) for 16 h. Subsequently, coverslips were

washed with 1x PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and either permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 or left 
non-permeabilized. Cells were then stained with anti-antennapedia antibody (anti-Antp 4C3, 1:100, University 
of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice 
with 1x PBS and stained with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary (1:1000, Invitrogen)  for 1 h at 
room temperature in the dark, before being mounted in DAPI mount (VWR) onto glass slides and imaged with 
a confocal microscope at 63x magnification (Leica). Appropriate secondary alone controls were completed to 
confirm the absence of background staining.  
CellTiter Glo Proliferation Studies 
MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in a 96-well (opaque-walled) plates at 1,000 cells/well and treated for 72 h with 
Antp peptide alone, aCx26-pep or vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS) at the concentrations shown in the figures. At 
day 0 and post 72 h of treatment, cells were lysed with CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent 
(Promega), shaken in the dark for 10 min, and luminescence was recorded. Fold change was calculated by 
normalizing the 72 h luminescence value to day 0 for each group. 
Self-renewal (Tumorsphere) Assays

growth factor (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 10  ng/ml epidermal growth factor (BioSource, Grand Island, 
μ
NY), 2% B27 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), and 10  g/ml insulin. The frequency of sphere formation was 
calculated in such a way that a well with a tumorsphere was counted as a positive well and a well with no 
tumorspheres  was  counted  as  a  negative  well.  Tumorspheres  were  counted  under  a  phase-contrast 
microscope  after  2  weeks. The stem  cell  frequencies  were  calculated  using  an  extreme limiting  dilution 
algorithm (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/)37.  
Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting

RNeasy  kit  (Qiagen,  Limburg,  Netherlands),  and  cDNA  was  synthesized  using  the  Superscript  III  kit 
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). For qPCR analysis, the threshold cycle (CT) values for each gene were 
normalized to expression levels of GAPDH. Dissociation curves were evaluated for primer fidelity. The primers 
used are detailed in Supplemental Table S3. 
Animal Studies 
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ  (NSG)  female  mice  were  purchased  from  Jackson  Laboratories  or  the 
Biological Resource Unit at the Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic. All mice were maintained in

microisolator units and provided free access to food and water. MDA MB 231 cells were transduced with a 
luciferase lentiviral vector (pHIV-Luciferase, Addgene #21375). Following puromycin drug selection, 1x106 cells 
were injected into the right subcutaneous flank of 6-week-old female mice. Once tumors became palpable, 
mice were randomized into groups and received a total of 50 µl of either 0.1 mM peptide or vehicle (1% 
DMSO) via intra-tumoral injection every other day for 20 days. Tumor progression was assessed weekly via 
bioluminescent  IVIS  imaging  (see  below).  Following  treatment  regiment,  mice  were  euthanized  by  CO

Results  
The Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex is present in patient TNBC samples 
Previous data from our group identified a protein complex unique to TNBC CSCs composed of the gap junction 
protein connexin 26 (Cx26), the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)34. 
To assess whether the Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex is also present in tumors from patients, we stained 
sections of human triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma for Cx26, NANOG, and FAK. Hematoxylin & eosin 
staining showed the invasive nature of the tumors (Fig. 1A). In cultured TNBC cells, we found that Cx26 
localizes  to  an  intracellular  compartment  rather  than  the  canonical  plasma  membrane  localization  of 
connexins34. Consistently, we observed intracellular localization of staining for Cx26, NANOG, and FAK in 
adjacent tumor sections of TNBC patient tumor (Fig. 1B-D). In contrast, tumor samples from patients with 
hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative tumors showed cell surface localization of Cx26 distinct from 
NANOG and FAK (Fig. 1E-H, summarized in Fig. 1I). This indicates that Cx26, NANOG, and FAK have 
similar subcellular localizations in TNBC, suggesting that the complex may be present in TNBC patient tumors 
as well as in cells, as we previously described34.   
FAK and NANOG interact with the cytosolic tail of Cx26 
Based on the essential role for the Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex in TNBC CSC maintenance34, targeting the 
complex represents a therapeutic opportunity. To develop therapies targeting the complex, we used surface 
plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  to  interrogate  the  specific  domains  through  which  the  proteins  interact.  We 
generated peptide fragments representing the intracellular and extracellular domains of Cx26 and determined 
their ability to bind to either FAK or NANOG by SPR. The strongest binding occurred between NANOG and the 
Cx26 cytosolic tail and between FAK and both the cytosolic tail and the cytosolic loop, with dissociation 
constants  in  the  nanomolar  and  micromolar  ranges,  respectively  (Fig.  2A).  Importantly,  no  binding  was 
observed  between  the  FAK  and  NANOG  proteins  alone  (Fig.  2A).  These  observations  combined  with 
predictive modeling suggest that complex binding requires Cx26, as we detected binding between Cx26 and 
NANOG,  Cx26  and  FAK,  and  all  members  of  the  complex  but  not  between  FAK  and  NANOG  alone 
(Supplemental Fig. 1). These data informed a binding schematic for the Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex (Fig.

2B) where NANOG binds to the C-terminus while FAK interacts with both the C-terminus and the intracellular 
loop of Cx26. To determine the specific Cx26 cytosolic tail amino acid residues important for binding, several 
truncations of the C-terminal tail were synthesized and subjected to SPR analysis for binding to both NANOG 
and FAK. The minimal required region mapped to Cx26 amino acids 216-220 (Supplemental Table S1 and 
Supplemental Fig. S2 and S3). To gain more insight into the kinetics of binding, we co-incubated the Cx26 
cytosolic tail with NANOG prior to applying the components to a FAK-bound chip. We also performed this 
analysis  with  Cx26  cytosolic  tail  pre-incubated  with  FAK  prior  to  applying  to  a  NANOG-bound  chip. 
Interestingly, the Cx26 cytosolic tail had decreased binding affinity for both FAK and NANOG when pre-
incubated with the other complex member compared to the Cx26 cytosolic tail alone or pre-incubation with 
bovine serum albumin control (not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that NANOG and FAK binding 
to the Cx26 cytosolic tail may be competitive.  
Based on the observation that the Cx26 cytosolic tail is essential for interaction with NANOG and FAK, we 
sought to understand the effect of disrupting the complex using a Cx26 cytosolic tail-derived cell-penetrating 
peptide. We  tagged  a  peptide  containing  the  Cx26  cytosolic  tail sequence  with  an  antennapedia  (Antp) 
(RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK)  leader  sequence  (termed  hereafter  aCx26-pep).  Antp  is  a  well-studied  leader 
sequence used to allow peptides and small molecules to penetrate the plasma membrane39.  aCT1, a Cx43 C-
terminal tail mimetic peptide, impairs the malignant progression of luminal breast cancer cells and enhances 
the activity of the standard-of-care chemotherapies lapatinib and tamoxifen40, 41. We first confirmed that the 
Antp leader sequence did not significantly alter the ability of aCx26-pep to bind to either FAK or NANOG by 
SPR (Fig. 2C). To determine the optimal treatment conditions, cells were assessed for the presence of aCx26-
pep by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D) and intracellular immunofluorescence (IF) staining (Fig. 2E) using an anti-Antp 
antibody. Optimal treatment conditions were determined to be 10 µM peptide for a minimum of 16 h.  
Self-renewal but not proliferation of TNBC cells is attenuated by aCx26-pep treatment 
To assess the functional impact of treatment, we evaluated cell proliferation and self-renewal in TNBC cells 
treated with aCx26-pep in vitro. MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were treated with increasing doses of vehicle, Antp 
alone,  and  aCx26-pep,  and  cell  proliferation  was  measured  after  72  h  of  treatment.  Interestingly,  cell

proliferation was not significantly affected by treatment with aCx26-pep (Fig. 3A, B). To assess changes in 
self-renewal, tumorsphere formation was interrogated in three TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 
and HCC70) and one luminal breast cancer cell line (MCF7) treated with vehicle, Antp, Antp-tagged scrambled 
aCx26-pep (aScr-pep), and aCx26-pep. Tumorsphere-initiation frequency was assessed using an extreme 
limiting-dilution assay (ELDA) and subsequently analyzed using ELDA analysis software37. TNBC cells treated 
with aCx26-pep had significantly decreased tumorsphere frequency compared to those treated with aScr-pep, 
whereas the luminal breast cancer cell line showed no significant difference between aScr-pep and aCx26-pep 
(Fig. 3C-F, Supplemental Table S2, Supplemental Fig. S4). A shortened region of the Cx26 cytosolic tail 
tagged with Antp, aCx26-pep 216-220, showed similar effects to aCx26-pep (Supplemental Fig. S5). We then 
evaluated the effect of aCx26-pep treatment on HCC70 CSCs and non-CSCs enriched using our NANOG-GFP 
reporter. aCx26-pep treatment significantly reduced tumorsphere frequency in both NANOG-GFPhi CSCs and 
NANOG-GFPlo  non-CSCs  (Supplemental  Fig.  S6).  Together,  these  data  show  that  disrupting  the 
Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex using aCx26-pep decreases the self-renewal capacity of TNBC.  
 aCx26-pep treatment alters FAK and NANOG levels and NANOG function   
To evaluate the effect of aCx26-pep on members of the Cx26/FAK/Nanog complex, we first measured the 
effect of the peptide on pluripotency transcription factors. While we did not observe a change in Sox2 levels 
(not shown), there was a significant decrease in Oct4 mRNA levels in both MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells 
treated with aCx26-pep compared to aScr-pep (Fig. 4A). We next interrogated whether peptide treatment 
affected the levels and subcellular localization of NANOG and FAK. After 48 h treatment with aCx26-pep, 
HCC70 cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting for FAK and NANOG (Fig. 4B). 
We observed dramatic decreases in both FAK and NANOG levels in the nuclear fraction of TNBC cells, 
suggesting that treatment with aCx26-pep may disrupt the function of these proteins. This recapitulates the 
destabilization of NANOG we previously observed after knockdown of Cx2634. To further understand the 
downstream signaling changes following treatment of TNBC cells with aCx26-pep, we performed a targeted 
qPCR assessment of NANOG-regulated genes. Following 7 days of treatment with vehicle, aScr-pep, or 
aCx26-pep, expression of NANOG target genes including FABP5, POSTN, NRP2, PIN1, and TAGLN was

significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells treated with aCx26-pep compared to those treated with 
vehicle or aScr-pep (Fig. 4C). Additionally, expression of epithelial cell markers such as cytokeratin 18 and 19 
(KRT18 and KRT19) was significantly increased in the aCx26-pep treatment group (Fig. 4D). In contrast, 
treatment of MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells did not significantly change NANOG target gene or cytokeratin 
gene expression (Fig. 4D-F). Together, these results indicate decreased levels of FAK and NANOG, reduced 
transcriptional activity of NANOG, and an increase in epithelial cell signature after treatment with aCx26-pep.  
In vivo TNBC tumor progression is attenuated by aCx26-pep  
To determine the effect of aCx26-pep on tumor formation in vivo, NSG mice were subcutaneously injected into 
the flank with TNBC MDA-MB-231 luciferase-expressing cells and randomized into treatment groups once 
tumors became palpable. Mice were intra-tumorally injected every other day for 20 days with either vehicle, 
aScr-pep, or aCx26-pep and monitored by weekly bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 5A). Mice treated with 
aCx26-pep exhibited significantly reduced luciferase signal (tumor burden) over time when compared to those 
treated with aScr-pep or vehicle controls (Fig. 5B, C).  
We then performed histological assessment of the resulting tumors. Upon H&E staining of isolated tumors, we 
observed that the percent tumor viability was significantly decreased in aCx26-pep-treated mice compared to 
vehicle- or aScr-pep-treated mice (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescence staining of the endpoint tumors showed that 
Ki67  (Fig.  6B),  a  marker  for  proliferation,  and  vimentin  (Fig.  6C),  a  marker  for  epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), were decreased, while cleaved caspase 3 was increased (Fig. 6D), in the aCx26-pep-treated 
groups, suggesting that peptide treatment led to a more epithelial cell phenotype with increased cell death and 
diminished proliferation. Taken together, these data support the efficacy of aCx26-pep for targeting TNBC 
CSCs.

Discussion  
Overall, our findings provide proof-of-concept data that a peptide strategy can be employed to reduce CSC 
self-renewal and tumor growth. We leveraged previous observations of the Cx26/NANOG/FAK complex in 
TNBC  to  develop  a  pre-clinical  peptide-based  targeting strategy  to  attenuate  CSC  function.  Our  studies 
focused solely on CSCs and tumor growth, key cancer phenotypes that likely involve FAK and NANOG. 
However, given the number of downstream signaling networks associated with FAK and NANOG, there are 
likely to be other cellular programs that may also be driven by their association with Cx26, including adhesion, 
migration, and invasion. An additional unanswered question is the possibility of differential functions of free and 
Cx26-complex-bound NANOG and FAK.  
Immunohistochemical analysis complemented our breast cancer cell line data, with the majority of TNBC 
specimens having cytoplasmic expression of Cx26 and a subset exhibiting a similar staining pattern of FAK 
and NANOG. In contrast, the majority of HR+/HER2- carcinomas showed membranous expression of Cx26 
and cytoplasmic localization of FAK and NANOG. The distinct cellular localization of Cx26 expression in TNBC 
and HR+/HER2- tumors further supports the hypothesis that therapeutic targeting of Cx26 would benefit this 
aggressive tumor subtype. Although the immunohistochemical TNBC data are not as compelling as those seen 
in the TNBC cell lines, FFPE immunohistochemistry may suffer from antibody affinity, fixation issues, and 
antigen retrieval. Clinical outcomes data related to a larger cohort defined with Cx26, FAK and NANOG will be 
helpful in further elucidating this complex and its role.   
Our findings identify a strategy to target CSCs and the NANOG-associated signaling network by blocking 
intracellular Cx26 interactions via a cell-penetrating peptide approach. A challenge in targeting connexin family 
members  remains  specificity,  as  there  is  a  high  degree  of  structural  homology  among  connexin  family 
members, apart from the cytoplasmic tail that provides a binding surface for adaptor proteins to initiate 
signaling programs. In previous work, the cytoplasmic tail of Cx43 was found to associate with zona occludens-
1 (ZO-1) to exclude assembled connexins from the gap junction plaque; disruption of the interaction with ZO-1 
resulted in an increase in gap junction intracellular communication41. A peptide mimetic of this region of the 
Cx43 tail tagged with antennapedia has been successfully leveraged to enhance diabetic would healing and is 
in advanced stages of clinical testing42, and a TAT fusion of a region of Cx43 that binds to SRC has been

shown to decrease glioblastoma CSC phenotypes43-47. These findings provided the first example that peptides 
can be used to modulate intracellular connexin function for a clinically relevant application. Our findings provide 
the first evidence of the utility of this application for TNBC targeting and potential downstream signaling 
modulation. While these peptide-based approaches show promise, there remain barriers to implementation, 
including delivery and stability. While we primarily tested aCx26-pep, which contains the full 11 amino acid 
cytosolic tail sequence, we observed similar effects with the first five amino acids of the cytosolic tail, RYCSG, 
which  corresponds  to  amino  acids  216-220.  Further  study  is  required  to  determine  the  optimal  peptide 
sequence for both efficacy and stability. Differences in concentrations of peptide available, as well as the 
presence of the tumor microenvironment, may have been responsible for slight differences between peptide 
effects observed in vivo and in vitro, such as tumor cell viability. An additional question is the effect of our 
targeting peptide on normal stem cell function. Based on our observation that aCx26-pep does not affect 
luminal breast cancer cells such as MCF7, which also express FAK and NANOG, we would anticipate limited 
toxicity to normal stem cells. Future studies will focus on addressing these key limitations to facilitate clinical 
translation.  
Targeting CSCs remains of interest in many cancers, including TNBC, but many late-stage trials are focused 
on canonical developmental programs (including Sonic hedgehog, Wnt, and Notch). Next-generation strategies 
are  more  likely  to  be  successful  if  they  can  leverage  CSC-specific  signaling  networks.  CSC  targeting 
represents a new cancer therapeutic development pipeline that is complementary to oncogene addiction 
targeting and tumor suppressor re-expression. Connexins and their main functions of cell-cell communication, 
hemichannel communication, and initiation of signaling have been largely understudied in the context of cancer 
and may represent a new therapeutic target. These findings highlight a selective strategy using a peptide 
approach to target TNBC, leading to new therapeutic options for the unmet need in this patient population.

Figure legends: 
Figure 1. Cx26, NANOG, and FAK localize to intracellular compartments in TNBC tumors. A-D: TNBC 
assessed by sequential whole slides as stained with A) Hematoxylin and eosin showing an invasive ductal 
carcinoma  with  focal  squamous  differentiation,  Nottingham  grade  3,    B)  NANOG  stain  showing  weak 
cytoplasmic expression within tumor cells (inset showing granular cytoplasmic staining in a large subset of the 
tumor cells), C) Cx26 stain showing intense cytoplasmic staining within a majority of the tumor cells (inset 
showing higher magnification) and D) FAK stain showing weak granular cytoplasmic staining within a subset of 
tumor cells (inset showing weak granular cytoplasmic staining and darker accentuation of staining in area of 
squamous  differentiation).  E-H:  Estrogen/progesterone  receptor  (ER/PR)+/HER2-  tumor  assessed  by 
sequential  whole  slides  stained  with  E)  Hematoxylin  and  eosin  showing  an  invasive  ductal  carcinoma, 
Nottingham grade 3, F) NANOG immunohistochemical stain showing variable cytoplasmic expression within 
tumor  cells  (inset  showing  both  weak  and  more  intense  foci  of  cytoplasmic  staining),  G)  Cx26 
immunohistochemical stain showing circumferential membranous expression on tumor cells (inset showing 
moderate to strong diffuse membrane staining) and H) FAK immunohistochemical stain showing very weak 
granular cytoplasmic staining within tumor cells (inset showing weak but diffuse granular cytoplasmic staining). 
Photomicrograph total magnification for each pane is 100x; inset total magnification is 400x. I) Summary table 
describing histological findings.  
Figure 2. Cx26 cytosolic tail peptide binds both FAK and NANOG and penetrates the cell membrane 
upon addition of an antennapedia (Antp) leader sequence. A) Table denoting dissociation constants for 
interactions between Cx26 and NANOG and FAK. B) Cartoon depiction of complex based on SPR analysis. C) 
Summary table of FAK and NANOG dissociation constants with Antp alone, tagged cytosolic tail, or tagged 
cleaved tail peptides by SPR analysis. D) Intracellular flow cytometry staining and E) immunofluorescence 
staining for Antp following 10 µM aCx26-pep treatment for 16 h, demonstrating the ability of the peptide to 
cross the plasma membrane. Scale bar, 40 µm.  
Figure 3. TNBC self-renewal but not cell proliferation is attenuated following aCx26-pep treatment. Cell 
proliferation measured by CellTiter Glo is not significantly affected by aCx26-pep treatment compared to

MDA-MB-231 C), MDA-MB-468 D), and HCC70 E) TNBC cells treated with aCx26-pep compared to vehicle, 
Antp alone, or aScr-pep controls but is not affected in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells (F). *** p<0.001 by 
Chi-squared test compared to aScr-pep.  
Figure 4. aCx26-pep treatment alters FAK and NANOG levels and NANOG function. A) Following a 7 day 
treatment  with  10  µM  aCx26-pep,  MDA-MB-231  and  HCC70  cells  had  decreased  expression  of  the 
pluripotency transcription factor Oct4. B) Treatment with aCx26-pep for 48 h decreased the amount of FAK and 
NANOG in the nuclear fraction. Actin and Lamin A/C were used as loading controls. Mem., membrane. Cyto, 
cytoplasmic. Nuc., nuclear. C-F) After 7 days of treatment, genes regulated by NANOG by qPCR  were 
decreased with aCx26-pep compared to cells treated with either cytosolic tail peptide alone, aScr-pep or 
vehicle  alone  (C),  while  the  expression  of  keratin  genes  was  increased  (D).  There  were  no  significant 
differences in gene expression between the vehicle, cytosolic tail, or aScr-pep groups. E-F) No changes were 
not  observed  in  NANOG  target  or  keratin  gene  expression  in  MCF7  luminal  breast  cancer  cells.  n=3 
independent experimental replicates, each performed in technical triplicate. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 by 
one-way ANOVA.  
Figure 5. Tumor growth is attenuated upon aCx26-pep treatment in vivo. A) Following palpability of 
tumors in the subcutaneous right flank generated by MDA-MB-231 cell injection, mice were intratumorally 
treated with 50 µl of either 0.1 mM peptide or vehicle (1% DMSO) every other day for 20 days and monitored 
by weekly IVIS imaging. B) Representative IVIS images of treated mice at Day 0 and Day 42. C) Tumors 
treated with aCx26-pep exhibited attenuated tumor growth over time compared to control groups. n=8 mice per 
group; * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 by two-way ANOVA.  
Figure  6.  aCx26-pep-treated  tumors  show  decreased  tumor  proliferation  and  cell  viability  and 
increased cell death. At endpoint, aCx26-pep-treated tumors exhibited diminished viability by H&E scoring 
(A), decreased Ki67 staining (B), decreased vimentin expression (C), and increased cleaved caspase 3 levels 
(D) compared to tumors treated with either aScr-pep or vehicle. H&E: 7-8 mice per group, IF staining: 3-4 mice
