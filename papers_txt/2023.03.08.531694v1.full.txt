Abstract 
  β-propellers that bind polyphosphoinositides (PROPPINs) are an 
autophagy-related protein family conserved throughout eukaryotes. The PROPPIN 
family includes Atg18, Atg21, and Hsv2 in yeast and WD-repeat protein interacting 
with phosphoinositides (WIPI)1–4 in mammals. Mutations in the WIPI genes are 
associated with human neuronal diseases, including β-propeller associated 
neurodegeneration (BPAN) caused by mutations in WDR45 (encoding WIPI4). In 
contrast to yeast PROPPINs, the functions of mammalian WIPI1–WIPI4 have not been 
systematically investigated. Although the involvement of WIPI2 in autophagy has been 
clearly shown, the functions of WIPI1, WIPI3, and WIPI4 in autophagy remain poorly 
understood. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the roles of WIPI proteins by 
using WIPI-knockout (single, double, and quadruple knockout) HEK293T cells and 
recently developed HaloTag-based reporters, which enable us to monitor autophagic 
flux sensitively and quantitatively. We found that WIPI2 was nearly essential for 
autophagy and partially redundant with WIPI1. Autophagic flux was unaffected or only 
slightly reduced by single deletion of WIPI3 (encoded by WDR45B) or WIPI4 but was 
profoundly reduced by double deletion of WIPI3 and WIPI4. Furthermore, we revealed 
variable effects of BPAN-related missense mutations on the autophagic activity of 
WIPI4. BPAN is characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
abnormalities, and we found a possible association between the magnitude of the defect 
of the autophagic activity of WIPI4 mutants and the severity of neurodevelopmental 
symptoms. However, some of the BPAN-related missense mutations, which produce 
neurodegenerative signs, showed almost normal autophagic activity, suggesting that 
non-autophagic functions of WIPI4 may be related to neurodegeneration in BPAN.

Introduction 
 
Macroautophagy (hereinafter, autophagy) is a degradation pathway that 
functions to maintain cellular homeostasis and is highly conserved among eukaryotes. 
In autophagy, a flat membrane cisterna termed the phagophore (also called the isolation 
membrane) expands to engulf cytoplasmic material, including proteins and organelles, 
and forms a double-membrane spherical structure called the autophagosome. Engulfed 
material is degraded after subsequent fusion with lysosomes. This pathway requires the 
concerted and hierarchical activities of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins (1–3). Upon 
starvation, the Atg1/ULK complex activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex 1, 
which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and phagophore membranes. β-propellers that bind polyphosphoinositides 
(PROPPINs) are recruited to PI3P-rich membranes, further recruiting downstream 
factors, namely Atg2/ATG2 and the Atg12/ATG12–Atg5/ATG5–Atg16/ATG16L1 
complex (1,2). Atg2/ATG2 transfers phospholipids from the ER to phagophores to 
expand the membrane (4–6). Atg8/ATG8 family proteins (i.e., LC3 and GABARAP 
family proteins) are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in autophagosomal 
membranes in a manner dependent on the Atg12/ATG12–Atg5/ATG5–Atg16/ATG16L1 
complex (7–9). 
The PROPPIN family includes Atg18, Atg21, and Hsv2 in yeast, Atg-18 and 
Epg-6 in Caenorhabditis elegans, and WD-repeat protein interacting with 
phosphoinositides (WIPI)1–4 in mammals. PROPPINs are phylogenetically divided into 
two paralog groups (10,11): one group includes Atg18, Atg21, Atg-18, and WIPI1/2, 
and the other includes Hsv2, Epg-6, and WIPI3/4 (10,11). The functions and 
hierarchical relationships of the three yeast PROPPINs have been well documented. 
Among them, Atg18 is essential for autophagy (12,13); Atg18 forms a complex with 
Atg2, and the formation of this complex is necessary for the recruitment of both 
proteins to phagophores (14,15). Atg21 is only partially required for autophagy; Atg21 
interacts with Atg16 and recruits the Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complex to induce Atg8–PE 
conjugation (16–18). Although Hsv2 is dispensable for autophagy, Hsv2 also interacts 
with Atg2 (19). In addition to autophagic functions, yeast PROPPINs have 
non-autophagic functions. For example, Atg18 is involved in the regulation of vacuolar 
size (20), vacuolar membrane fission (21), and transport from endo-lysosomal 
compartments to the Golgi apparatus (20,22,23). This function of Atg18 requires 
interaction with the retromer proteins Vps26 and Vps35, but this Atg18 complex is 
distinct from the retromer (22,23). It has also been reported that Hsv2 is localized to

endosomes under basal conditions, although its physiological role is unknown (19). In C. 
elegans, Epg-6 associates with Atg-2 and regulates autophagosome maturation, whereas 
Atg-18 functions in an earlier step, namely, autophagosome formation (24). Thus, the 
functions of the two paralog groups in autophagy, especially in the recruitment of Atg2 
to phagophores, are complicated and even differ among species. 
  In contrast to yeast PROPPINs, the function of each WIPI protein and the 
functional relationships among WIPI1–4 have not been fully elucidated. Although 
WIPI2 has been shown to be involved in autophagy through recruiting ATG16L1 to 
phagophores (25), the roles of WIPI1, WIPI3, and WIPI4 in autophagy remain poorly 
understood, and it is still unclear whether WIPI proteins contribute to the recruitment of 
ATG2A/B to phagophores in mammalian cells. One study on the functions of WIPI1–4 
showed that the stable knockdown of any WIPI impaired autophagosome formation in 
the human melanoma cell line G361 and suggested that WIPI3 and WIPI4 function 
downstream of WIPI1 and WIPI2 (26). Biochemical and structural studies revealed that 
WIPI4 strongly interacts with ATG2A/B (19,26,27), and other studies showed that 
ATG2A/B also interacts with WIPI3 to a lesser extent in vivo (28) and that a short 
peptide derived from ATG2A/B interacts with WIPI3 in vitro (29), suggesting possible 
contributions of WIPI3 and WIPI4 to the recruitment of ATG2A/B. Although WIPI3, 
WIPI4, and ATG2A/B are expressed ubiquitously, simultaneous deletion of WIPI3 and 
WIPI4 causes an autophagy defect observed only in cultured neuronal cells and mouse 
brains, but not in cultured non-neuronal cells, suggesting that WIPI3 and WIPI4 are 
important only in neuronal tissues (30,31). Moreover, it was shown that an ATG2A 
mutant (residues Y1395, F1396, and S1397 all mutated into alanines), which is unable 
to interact with WIPI4, supported the degradation of p62 and LC3B during starvation 
(32), suggesting the interaction between ATG2A/B and WIPI4 (and likely WIPI3) 
(28,29) is dispensable for autophagic flux. It was also shown that ATG2A/B proteins are 
recruited to phagophores by the interaction between ATG2A/B and ATG8 family 
proteins such as GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and LC3A (32). Therefore, the functional 
relationships among WIPI proteins seem to be complicated and merit further 
clarification. 
  Mutations in WIPI genes are known to cause human neuronal diseases. For 
example, mutations in WDR45, which encodes WIPI4, cause β-propeller 
protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN, formally called static encephalopathy of 
childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood [SENDA], OMIM#300894), which is 
typically characterized by static neurodevelopmental symptoms in the early stage of the 
disease and neurodegeneration in the late stage of the disease (33–35). Mutations in

WDR45B, which encodes WIPI3, also cause a complex neurodevelopmental disorder 
called El-Hattab-Alkuraya syndrome (OMIM#617977) (36–38), while mutations in 
WIPI2 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder accompanied by skeletal and cardiac 
abnormalities (OMIM#618453) (39,40). To understand the pathogenesis of these 
WIPI-related diseases, it would be helpful to reveal the function of each WIPI protein 
more precisely. 
  Because the contributions of each WIPI protein and of the interaction of ATG2 
with WIPIs and ATG8s to autophagy may be only partial, more sensitive, quantitative 
methods for monitoring autophagic flux would be necessary for a systematic analysis of 
these proteins. Recently, we developed a highly sensitive and quantitative method, the 
HaloTag (Halo)-based reporter processing assay (41). Using this method, we 
comprehensively analyzed the function of individual WIPI proteins using single or 
multiple WIPI-knockout HEK293T cells and revealed the necessity of WIPI2 in 
autophagy and the rigorous contribution of WIPI4 to the recruitment of ATG2 to 
phagophores. Finally, we found a possible association between the magnitude of 
autophagy defect and the severity of neurodevelopmental symptoms by assessing the 
autophagic activities of disease-related mutants of WIPI3 and WIPI4. In contrast, no 
clear correlation was found between the magnitude of autophagy defects and the age of 
the onset of neurodegeneration, suggesting that neurodegeneration in BPAN may be 
caused by a defect in a non-autophagic function of WIPI4.

Results 
 
WIPI2 is nearly essential for mammalian autophagy 
  To investigate the importance of individual WIPI proteins in mammalian 
autophagy, we generated WIPI1–4 single knockout (KO) and WIPI1–4 quadruple KO 
(QKO) HEK293T cells (Fig. S1). In addition, because of the close phylogenetic 
relationships between WIPI1 and WIPI2 and between WIPI3 and WIPI4 (10,11), we 
generated WIPI1/2 double KO (DKO) and WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells (Fig. S1). As 
ATG16L1 and ATG2A/B function immediately downstream of WIPIs (1,2), we also 
generated ATG16L1 KO and ATG2A/B DKO HEK293T cells (Fig. S1). To measure the 
autophagic activity of these cells using the Halo-based reporter processing assay, we 
stably introduced the Halo–monomeric GFP (Halo–GFP) and Halo–LC3B (simply 
referred to as Halo–LC3) reporters (41). When these Halo-based reporters are delivered 
to lysosomes via autophagy, they are efficiently degraded. However, Halo becomes 
resistant to lysosomal degradation when it is conjugated with Halo ligands, producing a 
free Halo fragment in an autophagy-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). 
  First, we used the Halo–GFP reporter, which is incorporated into 
autophagosomes non-selectively. When wild-type HEK293T cells stably expressing 
Halo–GFP were incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-conjugated ligand for 
30 min and further incubated in a ligand-free amino-acid starvation medium for 4 h, the 
band corresponding to free Halo was observed by in-gel fluorescence detection (Fig. 
1B). In ATG16L1 KO cells, Halo–GFP processing was markedly impaired, but a faint 
Halo fragment was still detected, which is consistent with previous findings that a low 
level of autophagic flux remains in cells lacking the ATG8 conjugation machinery 
(42–44). Halo–GFP processing was completely blocked in ATG2A/B DKO cells. 
  Among WIPI single KO cells, WIPI2 KO cells showed an almost complete 
absence of Halo–GFP processing, suggesting that WIPI2 is nearly essential for 
autophagy (Fig. 1B and C). WIPI1 KO and WIPI3 KO had no significant impact on 
Halo–GFP processing, whereas WIPI4 KO caused a slight reduction. Halo–GFP 
processing was further impaired in WIPI3/4 DKO cells, indicating the functional 
redundancy of WIPI3 and WIPI4, as previously observed in neuronal cells (30). 
  Next, we conducted the processing assay using the Halo–LC3 reporter, which 
is selectively sequestered into autophagosomes. Again, the processing of Halo–LC3 was 
completely blocked in both ATG2A/B DKO and WIPI1–4 QKO cells (Fig. 1D and E). 
WIPI2 KO cells showed an almost complete absence of Halo–LC3 processing, and the 
residual Halo–LC3 processing was further impaired by the simultaneous knockout of

WIPI1 and WIPI2 (in WIPI1/2 DKO cells), suggesting that, although WIPI2 plays a 
dominant role, WIPI1 functions redundantly with WIPI2 (Fig. 1D and E). WIPI3/4 
DKO cells showed a partial but still significant impairment of Halo–LC3 processing. 
Unlike the Halo–GFP processing assay, the Halo–LC3 processing assay showed no 
significant defect in WIPI4 KO cells. This may be caused by a difference in the dynamic 
range or sensitivity between the Halo–GFP and Halo–LC3 processing assays. Because 
Halo–LC3 is selectively and efficiently incorporated into autophagosomes, the 
Halo–LC3 processing assay has higher sensitivity to detect low autophagic activities 
(e.g., in WIPI2 KO cells). However, when autophagic activities are relatively high (e.g., 
in WIPI4 KO cells), Halo–LC3 processing can become easily saturated and accordingly 
unable to reveal a subtle decrease in autophagic flux. Thus, the Halo–GFP processing 
assay would be more suitable for detecting a slight defect.  
  In contrast to our Halo-based processing assay showing a clear decrease in 
autophagic flux in WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells (Fig. 1), a recent study suggested that 
WIPI3 and WIPI4 are dispensable for autophagy in non-neuronal cells, as p62 (also 
known as SQSTM1) and LC3 do not accumulate in WIPI3/4 DKO COS7 cells and 
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (30). Consistently, we confirmed no accumulation of 
lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) and p62 as well as normal degradation of LC3-II during 
starvation in WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B, S2A–C). We also assessed 
autophagic flux in WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells using another reporter, 
GFP–LC3–RFP (Fig. S2D) (42). GFP–LC3–RFP is cleaved by endogenous ATG4 
proteins to produce an equimolar amount of GFP–LC3 and RFP. GFP–LC3 is 
conjugated to autophagosomal membranes and then degraded or quenched, while RFP 
remains in the cytosol. Therefore, the reduction in the GFP:RFP fluorescence ratio 
represents autophagic flux. We observed that the GFP:RFP fluorescence ratio was 
similar in wild-type and WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells before and after starvation (Fig. 
S2E). Thus, the conventional methods using LC3 and p62 were unable to detect the 
slight autophagy defect in WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells. This is probably due to the 
lower sensitivity of these degradation-based assays, which measure the reduction of 
autophagy substrates, compared with the Halo-based processing assay, which measures 
the production of the Halo fragment (i.e., positive signal). 
  In summary, in HEK293T cells, WIPI2 is nearly essential for autophagy, and 
WIPI1 functions redundantly with WIPI2, although its contribution is limited. WIPI3 
and WIPI4 function redundantly for autophagy, and WIPI3 and WIPI4 are each only 
partially necessary or not necessary for autophagy. Considering the non-selective 
incorporation of Halo–GFP into autophagosomes, the Halo–GFP processing assay

should reflect the true activity of bulk autophagy. Therefore, we used it in the following 
experiments. 
 
WIPI2 and WIPI4 regulate autophagy at different steps 
  Next, we introduced individual WIPIs or combinations of WIPIs into WIPI 
QKO cells. Among two WIPI1 isoforms (A and B) and six WIPI2 isoforms (A, B, C, D, 
E, and delta), WIPI1A, WIPI2B, and WIPI2D have been reported to be recruited to 
phagophores (10,11,25,26,43). In particular, WIPI2B has been shown to play an 
important role in autophagy in vivo (25). Therefore, we used WIPI1A and WIPI2B for 
this experiment. When expressed alone, only WIPI2B restored Halo–GFP processing in 
WIPI QKO cells (Fig. 2A and B). The p62 level was also reduced. The restoration of 
Halo–GFP processing by WIPI2 was not changed by the further addition of WIPI1A or 
WIPI3, but was significantly enhanced by the addition of WIPI4 (Fig. 2A and B). 
Almost full recovery was observed when both WIPI2B and WIPI4 were expressed. 
WIPI3 and WIPI4 could not restore Halo–GFP processing, even when both proteins 
were expressed (Fig. 2A and B). These results suggest that WIPI2 and WIPI4 support 
autophagy at different steps and that WIPI2 is essential for the function of WIPI4 in 
autophagy. 
 
WIPI4 regulates autophagy through its interaction with PI3P and ATG2A/B and 
maintains the size of autophagosomes 
  By using Halo-based reporters, we were able to detect a clear autophagy defect 
in WIPI3/4 DKO cells, which was difficult to detect by using conventional methods (Fig. 
1, S2), enabling us to further examine the roles of WIPI3 and WIPI4 in autophagy. To 
investigate the significance of PI3P binding of WIPI3 and WIPI4, we generated WIPI3 
R225T/R226T (WIPI3 LTTG) and WIPI4 R232T/R233T (WIPI4 LTTG) mutants, which 
completely lost their binding to PI3P (26,44,45). In WIPI3/4 DKO cells, the expression 
of either WIPI3 or WIPI4 significantly restored Halo–GFP processing, confirming that 
WIPI3 and WIPI4 are indeed functionally redundant (Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, the 
WIPI3 LTTG and WIPI4 LTTG mutants failed to restore Halo–GFP processing, 
suggesting that WIPI3 and WIPI4 function through binding to PI3P (Fig. 3A and B). 
  WIPI4 is known to interact with ATG2A/B (26,28,29). We confirmed that 
ATG2A/B interacts with WIPI4 almost exclusively among WIPI1–4 (Fig. 3C). WIPI2B 
appeared to faintly interact with ATG2A/B. WIPI1A and, in contrast to the results of 
previous studies (28,29), WIPI3 did not interact with ATG2A/B in this experimental 
condition. Therefore, we investigated whether the WIPI4–ATG2A/B interaction is

necessary for the function of WIPI4. For this purpose, the WIPI4 N15A/D17A mutant, 
which is unable to interact with ATG2A/B, was prepared (26) (Fig. S3). Halo–GFP 
processing was significantly impaired in WIPI4 N15A/D17A-expressing WIPI3/4 DKO 
cells in contrast to almost normal processing in wild-type WIPI4-expressing cells (Fig. 
3D and E). In this experiment, the expression level of WIPI4 N15A/D17A was 
remarkably decreased compared with wild-type WIPI4, but the level of WIPI4 
N15A/D17A was still higher than that of endogenous WIPI4 (Fig. 3D). These results 
suggest that the interaction between WIPI4 and ATG2 is important for autophagy. 
(28,29) 
  It was previously reported that the size of autophagosomes is smaller in mouse 
WIPI3/4 DKO Neuro-2a cells compared with parental cells (30). To confirm this pattern 
in HEK293T cells, we observed autophagosomes using 3D correlative light electron 
microscopy using GFP–LC3 as a marker (46). After a 1-h starvation period, 
GFP–LC3-positive closed autophagosomes were abundant in both wild-type and 
WIPI3/4 DKO cells (Fig. 3F, S4A). Furthermore, we confirmed that the number of 
GFP–LC3-positive structures was not reduced in WIPI3/4 DKO cells (Fig. S4B). 
However, the size of autophagosomes was strikingly reduced in WIPI3/4 DKO cells 
(Fig. 3F and G). Collectively, these results suggest that WIPI4, and possibly WIPI3 also, 
support autophagic flux through interactions with PI3P and ATG2A/B and maintain the 
size, rather than the number, of autophagosomes even in non-neuronal cells.   
 
Recruitment of ATG2A to phagophores is mediated by its interaction with WIPI4 
and ATG8s 
  Regarding the recruitment of ATG2A/B to phagophores, a previous study 
showed the significance of their interaction with ATG8s and suggested that the 
interaction between WIPI3/4 and ATG2A/B is dispensable for autophagy (32). However, 
using the Halo–GFP reporter, we instead found that the interaction between WIPI4 and 
ATG2A/B is crucial (Fig. 3D and E). Therefore, we next investigated the relative 
contributions of these two interactions using Halo-based reporters. For this purpose, we 
prepared several mutants for ATG2A only, as ATG2A and ATG2B function redundantly 
(47) (Fig. 4A). ATG2A interacts with WIPI3/4 through its WIPI-interacting region (WIR, 
residues 1374–1404) (29), while ATG2A interacts with ATG8s through its 
LC3-interacting region (LIR, residues 1362–1365) (32). We mutated these regions to 
render ATG2A unable to interact with either ATG8s or WIPI3/4 or both (Fig. 4A). We 
confirmed that LIR mutation reduced the interaction with GABARAP but not WIPI4, 
whereas WIR deletion almost completely blocked the interaction with WIPI4 but not

GABARAP (Fig. S5A and B). 
  In ATG2A/B DKO cells, wild-type ATG2A fully rescued Halo–GFP processing 
(Fig. 4B and C). In contrast, the LIR mutant (ATG2A mLIR) or the WIR deletion 
mutant (ATG2A ΔWIR) showed partially impaired Halo–GFP processing (Fig. 4B and 
C). ATG2A with both LIR mutation and WIR deletion (ATG2A mLIRΔWIR) showed a 
further decrease in Halo–GFP processing, suggesting that LIR and WIR collaboratively 
function (Fig. 4B and C). These ATG2A mutants still interacted with WIPI2B to similar 
extents as wild-type ATG2A (Fig. S5C), suggesting that the interaction between ATG2A 
and WIPI2B is not important for autophagy.  
  Next, we investigated whether the reduced autophagic activity of the ATG2A 
mutants was attributable to defects in their recruitment to phagophores. ATG2A 
colocalized with WIPI2B, a phagophore marker, and LipidTOX, a lipid droplet marker, 
as previously reported (47,48) (Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, the colocalization rates 
between ATG2A mutants (mLIR, ΔWIR, and mLIRΔWIR) and WIPI2B were 
significantly reduced (Fig. 5A and B). Instead, most puncta of the ATG2A mutants 
colocalized with LipidTOX. These results suggest that the interactions of ATG2A with 
WIPI4 and ATG8s contribute to the recruitment of ATG2A to phagophores.  
  To further confirm that the defects of the ATG2A mutants were indeed 
attributable to impaired recruitment, we assessed whether the forced recruitment of 
ATG2A mLIRΔWIR to phagophores could recover the function of ATG2A. We fused 
the PI3P-binding 2×FYVE domain (49) or WIPI4 to ATG2A mLIRΔWIR (Fig. 5C). 
These fusion proteins significantly enhanced Halo–GFP processing in ATG2A/B DKO 
cells compared with ATG2A mLIRΔWIR, confirming that proper recruitment of ATG2A 
is important (Fig. 5D and E). 
 
Some of the disease-associated WIPI4 mutants retain autophagic activity 
  Next, we evaluated the autophagic activity of disease-related mutants of WIPI3 
and WIPI4 (34,36,50–60). One WIPI3 mutant and 15 WIPI4 mutants were expressed in 
WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells, and Halo–GFP processing after a 4-h starvation period 
was evaluated. We used WIPI3/4 DKO cells for this purpose because WIPI3 KO and 
WIPI4 KO HEK293T cells showed no or only slight autophagy defects (Fig. 1). The 
WIPI3 R109Q mutant showed decreased Halo–GFP processing (the clinical phenotype 
was not described in detail (36)) (Fig. 6A and B). The disease-related WIPI4 mutations 
exhibited various effects on Halo–GFP processing. Notably, four WIPI4 mutants (V66E, 
D84G, F100S, and N202K) showed almost normal Halo–GFP processing similar to that 
of wild-type WIPI4, and two mutants (R134P and G168E) showed only mild defects

(Fig. 6A and B).   
  Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the magnitude of 
autophagy defect and the clinical phenotype of each mutation in WIPI4. Patients with 
these mutations vary in age, and some of the patients may have not yet developed 
symptoms indicative of neurodegeneration, such as parkinsonism and dementia. In 
addition, clinical phenotypes were not described in detail for all the patients. Therefore, 
we first focused on the severity of intellectual disability, which is relatively detailed in 
most of the reports, as an indicator of the severity of neurodevelopmental symptoms. 
We examined 2 male patients and 14 female patients (34,50–60). In 5 female patients 
with mutations D84G, F100S, R134P, G168E, and N202K, which were determined to 
have no impact or only a mild impact on autophagic activity, intellectual disability 
tended to be mild (52–54,56). Patients with mutations D84G and F100S could speak in 
sentences and began to walk at a typical age (52,53). Patients with mutations R134P and 
G168E, who were 2-year-7-month-old and 5-year-old patients, respectively, could each 
speak a couple of words (54). The patient with mutation N202K could not communicate 
verbally but could communicate partially in a non-verbal way (56). In contrast, the 
intellectual disabilities of patients with mutations L160R, A209D, and S210P, which 
caused a profound defect in autophagic activity, seemed to be more severe, as they did 
not acquire any language abilities (55,58,59). Because WDR45, the gene encoding 
WIPI4, is on the X chromosome, the expression level of WIPI4 depends on the extent of 
X chromosome inactivation in each female case. In addition, the stabilities of mutant 
proteins may affect the expression level of each mutant WIPI4. Nevertheless, our data 
suggest a possible association between autophagic activity and the severity of 
intellectual disability. 
  Seven female patients developed symptoms indicative of neurodegeneration, 
such as dementia and parkinsonism (35,56,58–60). However, there was no clear 
correlation between the autophagic activity and the age of onset of these symptoms (Fig. 
7). For example, although the N202K mutation had almost no impact on the autophagic 
activity of WIPI4, the patient with the N202K mutation developed parkinsonism at the 
age of 27 (56). Additionally, a patient with the D84G mutation, which also had no 
impact on the autophagic activity of WIPI4, showed iron accumulation in both the 
globus pallidus and substantia nigra, as detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging, 
indicating that the patient would likely develop parkinsonism in the future. 
Neurodevelopmental symptoms were very mild in this patient, probably reflecting 
almost normal autophagic flux. These findings suggest that WIPI4 has non-autophagic 
functions, which may be important for the prevention of neurodegeneration and iron

Discussion 
 
  In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of WIPI proteins using highly 
sensitive autophagic flux reporters and multiple knockout cell lines. We confirmed the 
nearly essential function of WIPI2 in autophagy (Fig. 1), which is consistent with a 
previous report showing that the depletion of WIPI2 caused the most drastic inhibition 
of autophagosome formation among the depletions of each of the WIPI proteins (26). It 
was also previously shown that the depletion of WIPI1 moderately inhibits 
autophagosome formation in G361 cells (26). However, our quantitative study in 
HEK293T cells showed, although WIPI1 may be redundant with WIPI2 possibly 
through its interaction with ATG16L1 (25,26), the contribution of WIPI1 was very 
limited (Fig. 8). This result may correspond to the finding that the interaction between 
WIPI1 and ATG16L1 is far weaker than that between WIPI2 and ATG16L1 (25). 
Instead, WIPI1 is endowed with a non-autophagic function related to endosomal 
membrane fission and endosomal transport (61), which may correspond to the 
non-autophagic function of yeast Atg18 in retrograde transport from endosomes to the 
Golgi apparatus (20,22,23) (Fig.8) . 
  The roles of WIPI3 and WIPI4 in autophagy have been controversial. LC3 
accumulates upon double knockdown of WIPI3 and WIPI4 in G361 cells (26). Although 
p62 accumulates in the brain (but not in the liver or kidney) of Wipi3/4 DKO mice, it is 
virtually absent from the brain of Wipi3 KO and Wipi4 KO mice (31). The degradation 
of LC3 is reduced in fibroblasts derived from BPAN patients (62). On the other hand, it 
was reported that the levels of LC3 and p62 were normal in WIPI3/4 DKO COS7 cells 
and Wipi3/4 DKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (30). In the present study, our 
Halo-based processing assay clearly revealed a decrease in autophagic flux in WIPI3/4 
DKO HEK293T cells, while canonical methods, such as LC3 and p62 degradation and 
GFP–LC3–RFP reporter assays, failed to detect the autophagy defect in WIPI3/4 DKO 
HEK293T cells. We assume that these previous inconsistencies might be a consequence 
of the relatively low sensitivities of LC3-based autophagic flux assays to detect subtle 
autophagy defects. Our results using appropriate methods showed that WIPI3 and 
WIPI4 are redundantly important for autophagy, even in non-neuronal cells. Our data 
also suggest that, at least for autophagic flux in HEK293T cells, WIPI4 appears to be 
more important than WIPI3, because the deletion of WIPI4 showed a larger suppressive 
effect on autophagy than that of WIPI3 (Fig. 1), and the rescue effect of re-expression of 
WIPI4 in WIPI1–4 QKO was greater than that of WIPI3 (in the presence of WIPI2) (Fig. 
2). This may be because ATG2 interacts with WIPI4 more strongly than with WIPI3

(28). ATG2 was detected in the interactome of WIPI4 but not WIPI3 (26). Consistent 
with these results, we detected interaction between WIPI4 and ATG2A/B, but not 
between WIPI3 and ATG2A/B (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, our results showing functional 
redundancy between WIPI3 and WIPI4 suggest that WIPI3 and WIPI4 function in 
autophagy through the same mechanism or at least a partially shared mechanism. 
  The next issue regards the relationship between the two functional units, 
WIPI1/2 and WIPI3/4. It was reported that, in C. elegans, Atg-18 (a homolog of 
WIPI1/2) appears to function upstream of Epg-6 (a homolog of WIPI3/4), but the 
phenotype of atg-18 mutants is milder than that of epg-6 mutants (24). In mammals, 
WIPI1 and WIPI2 also function upstream of WIPI3 and WIPI4 (26). Our data are 
consistent with these previous reports; WIPI1/2 DKO cells showed an almost complete 
block in autophagic flux, whereas WIPI3/4 DKO cells maintained partial autophagic 
activity (Fig. 1) and were able to form small autophagosomes (Fig. 3) as previously 
shown in neuronal cells (30), suggesting that WIPI1 and WIPI2 are important for an 
early step of autophagosome formation and that WIPI3 and WIPI4 are important for the 
elongation step. Our data showing the additive effect of WIPI2 and WIPI4 further 
suggest that WIPI2 and WIPI4 have distinct functions. ATG16L1 and ATG2A/B are 
known downstream factors of WIPI2 and WIPI4, respectively (1,2). It was previously 
reported that ATG8s, which are conjugated to PE by the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 
complex, recruit ATG2A/B via interaction with the LIR domain in ATG2A/B (32), but 
the relative contribution of ATG8s and WIPI3/4 to ATG2 recruitment has been unknown. 
We suggest that both are redundantly important, as the LIR mutation and WIR deletion 
showed an additive effect (Fig. 4B and C). It should also be noted that the inhibition of 
Halo–GFP processing in WIPI2 KO cells was greater than that in ATG16L1 KO cells 
(Fig. 1B and C). The data suggest that WIPI2 has a yet unknown fundamental function 
beyond the recruitment of ATG16L1 (Fig. 8). A previous report has shown the 
interaction between WIPI2 and ATG2A/B (28), and we also detected a possible 
interaction between WIPI2B and ATG2A/B (Fig. 3C). The mutations of ATG2A, which 
reduce the interactions with GABARAP and WIPI3/4 and suppress the recruitment of 
ATG2A to phagophores, did not impair the interaction between ATG2A and WIPI2B 
(Fig. S4C). Therefore, the interaction between ATG2 and WIPI2 may be important for a 
potential mechanism other than the recruitment of ATG2. This hypothesis may be 
consistent with our finding that WIPI2 and WIPI4 function in autophagy through 
different mechanisms (Fig. 2). 
  BPAN patients exhibit only neuronal symptoms (33–35), and Wipi3/4 DKO 
mice also demonstrate p62 accumulation only in the brain (31), leading to the

hypothesis that the autophagic functions of WIPI3 and WIPI4 are specific to neuronal 
tissues. In this study, we revealed WIPI4 functions in autophagy, even in non-neuronal 
cells. Therefore, the tissue specificity of BPAN and related mouse models may be 
explained by the vulnerability of neuronal tissues to mild autophagy defects rather than 
tissue-specific functions, as seen in other autophagy-related diseases (63–67). Another 
possibility is that the relative importance of WIPI4 and ATG8s in recruiting ATG2A/B 
may differ between neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.  
   Halo-based reporter assays revealed various effects of BPAN-related missense 
mutations in WIPI4 on their autophagic activity. We found a possible association 
between the magnitude of autophagy defect and the severity of neurodevelopmental 
symptoms, which is consistent with the previous findings that neurodevelopmental 
defects are core symptoms in autophagy-related diseases with mutations in EPG5, 
ATG5, and ATG7 (63–67). In contrast, we detected no correlation between the 
magnitude of autophagy defect and the age of the onset of neurodegeneration 
symptoms; some mutations found in BPAN patients with iron deposition and 
neurodegeneration symptoms showed almost normal autophagic activity. These findings 
suggest that the development of iron deposition and neurodegeneration in BPAN is 
attributable to unknown non-autophagic functions of WIPI4, for example, in retrograde 
transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus, as was also suggested for its most 
closely related yeast PROPPIN, Hsv2 (Fig. 8) (19). Elucidating the non-autophagic 
functions of WIPI4 is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of BPAN and develop 
therapeutics for the prevention of neurodegeneration in the disease.

Materials and Methods 
 
Cell lines 
HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM; D6546, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS, 173012, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mM L-glutamine (25030-081, Gibco, 
Waltham, MA) at 37℃ in a 5% CO  incubator. For starvation, after being washed twice 
2
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were cultured in amino acid-free DMEM 
(048-33575, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan) without serum 
(starvation medium) for the time indicated for each experiment. For bafilomycin A  
1
treatment, cells were incubated in a starvation medium with 100 nM bafilomycin A  
1
(B1793, Sigma-Aldrich) for the time indicated for each experiment. 
 
Plasmids 
DNA fragments encoding WIPI1 (NM_017983.7), WIPI2 (NM_016003.4), WIPI3 
(NM_019613.4), WIPI4 (NM_001029896.2), and their variants were inserted into the 
retroviral plasmids pMRXIP (68), pMRXIB, and pMRXIH together with 3×FLAG tag 
or HaloTag7 (N2701, Promega, Madison, WI). DNA fragments encoding ATG2A 
(NM_015104.3) and its variants were inserted into pMRXIP (68) together with 
monomeric ultrastable green fluorescent protein (muGFP). DNA fragments encoding 
ATG2A (NM_015104.3) and its variants were also inserted into pMRXNo. The 
pMRXIB, pMRXIH, and pMRXNo plasmids were constructed by replacing a 
puromycin-resistant gene cassette with a blasticidin-resistant gene cassette, a 
hygromycin B-resistant gene cassette, and an internal ribosomal entry site driven 
SNAP-tag (N9181S, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), respectively. Mutated or 
truncated constructs were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The 
pMRXIP-GFP-LC3-RFP, pMRXIB-Halo-mGFP, and pMRXNo-Halo-ratLC3B 
plasmids were constructed as described previously (41,42).  
For the generation of KO cell lines, guide RNAs (gRNAs) were cloned into 
pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458; a gift from Dr. F. Zhang, Broad Institute of 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; #48138, Addgene, Watertown, MA).  
 
Antibodies and reagents 
For immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal 
anti-HSP90 (61049, BD Transduction Lab, San Jose, CA) and anti-WIPI2 (MABC91, 
Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-p62 (PM045, MBL, Tokyo, Japan),

anti-ATG2A (PD041, MBL), anti-ATG2B (15131-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL), 
anti-ATG16L1 (M150-3, MBL), and anti-WIPI4 (19194-1-AP, Proteintech) antibodies. 
Rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 antibody was described previously (69). Horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (111-035-003, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G 
(111-035-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) antibodies were used as 
secondary antibodies. As described above, 100 nM bafilomycin A  (B1793, 
1
Sigma-Aldrich) was applied. Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-conjugated HaloTag ligand 
(G8251, Promega) and SF650-conjugated HaloTag ligand (A308-02, Goryo Chemical, 
Tokyo, Japan) were applied at concentrations of 100 nM and 200 nM, respectively. 
LipidTOX Red (H34476, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used for the 
observation of lipid droplets. 
 
The generation of KO cell lines 
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gRNA 
sequences were as follows: human ATG2A, 5′-TTCCAGGTGGATGTCTCGCA-3′; 
human ATG2B, 5′-ATGGACTCCGAAAACGGCCA-3′; human ATG16L1, 5′

-GACGATGGCCACTAGGCTGC-3′; human WIPI3, 5′
-GGTTGAGTGCAATGCAGCTC-3′; human WIPI4, 5′
-AGACTCCCACACTTGTGTCCC-3. HEK293T cells were transfected with PX458 
vector with the gRNA. After 48 h, GFP-positive cells were isolated into single clones 
using a cell sorter (MoFlo Astrios EQ; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). For the 
confirmation of each gene KO, genomic DNAs spanning the target sequences were 
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and PCR amplicons were cloned into 
the plasmid of the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (450031, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and sequenced. The PCR primers used are as follows: human ATG2A-fw, 
5′-TCAGTAGGCCTCGCCCTTTGC-3′; human ATG2A-rv, 
5′-AGATTCCCCTGGCCTCTCTAC-3′; human ATG2B-fw,

Preparation of retrovirus for stable expression 
For the preparation of retrovirus, HEK293T cells were transfected with a retroviral 
vector  together with pCG-VSV-G and pCG-gag-pol (gifts from Dr. T. Yasui), using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days after transfection, 
the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter unit (SLHV033RB, Merck 
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and collected. Then, the retrovirus was applied to cells, and 
stable transformants were selected by application of 2 μg/mL puromycin (P8833, 
Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/mL blasticidin (022-18713, Wako), and 100 μg/mL hygromycin B 
(10687-010, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the generation of ATG2A/B DKO HEK293T 
cells stably expressing ATG2A or its variants, ATG2A/B DKO HEK293T cells were 
infected with the retrovirus carrying ATG2A or ATG2A variants and the internal 
ribosomal entry site drive SNAP-tag. Stable transformants were labeled with 100 nM 
SNAP-Cell 647-SiR ligand (New England Biolabs, S9102S). The fluorescence signals 
from SNAP-Cell 647-SiR were detected, and cells with the same fluorescence 
intensities were collected by a cell sorter (MoFlo AstriosEQ; Beckman Coulter).  
 
Protein extraction and immunoblotting 
Cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl , 0.2% 
2
n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail 
(05056489001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 10 min on ice and then treated with 0.1% 
benzonase (9025-65-4, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min on ice. The protein concentrations in 
the whole cell lysates were measured by the BCA method. The whole cell lysates were 
mixed with 6× sample buffer (46.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1.67% SDS, 1% 
β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromophenol blue) and heated to 95℃ for 5 min. The 
protein concentrations were adjusted with 1×sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred 
to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (IPVH00010, Millipore) using the 
Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Immunoblotting analysis 
was performed with the antibodies indicated in the figures. The signals were visualized

with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (P90715, Millipore) and 
were detected on a Fusion SOLO.7S.EDGE (Vilber-Lourmat, Collégien, France). 
Contrast and brightness were adjusted and quantified using the Fiji image processing 
package (70). 
 
Coimmunoprecipitation 
Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 
(11668019, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days later, cells were lysed with 50 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl , 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% benzonase 
2
(9025-65-4, Sigma-Aldrich), and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail 
(05056489001; Roche). Then, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 
anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220, Sigma-Aldrich). The beads were washed three 
times in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl , 0.5% NP-40, and 
2
Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (05056489001; Roche), and bound 
proteins were eluted with 1× sample buffer at 95℃ for 5 min. Subsequently, samples 
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. 
 
Halo–GFP/LC3 processing assay 
Cells were incubated with 100 nM TMR-conjugated HaloTag ligand (G8251, Promega) 
for 30 min. After being washed twice with PBS, cells were cultured in the starvation 
medium for the time indicated. Then, cells were harvested, and proteins were obtained. 
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was immediately visualized for 
in-gel fluorescence from TMR with a Fusion SOLO.7S.EDGE (Vilber-Lourmat). For 
the calculation of Halo–LC3 processing, the images of gels were captured with an 
exposure time of 30 sec. The Halo–LC3 processing rate was calculated as the intensity 
of the free Halo band divided by the sum of the intensities of the free Halo and 
unprocessed Halo–LC3 bands. In the Halo–GFP processing assay, Halo processing is 
usually so low that the intensity of free Halo and unprocessed Halo–GFP bands cannot 
be visualized in the same image because the appropriate exposure time for each is 
different. Therefore, the images of gels were obtained twice with exposure times of 2 s 
and 10 min. The Halo–GFP processing rate was calculated as the intensity of the free 
Halo band in the 10-min exposed image divided by the intensity of the unprocessed 
Halo–GFP band in the 2-s exposed image (total Halo–GFP [processed + unprocessed] 
can be approximated as the intensity of unprocessed Halo–GFP in a 2-s exposed image, 
in which processed Halo can be hardly observed).

Flow cytometry 
After a 3-min treatment with trypsin-EDTA (25300062, Gibco), cells were collected in 
ice-cold PBS. After washing, cells were analyzed on a cell analyzer (Cytoflex, Beckman 
Coulter) equipped with 488 nm, 561 nm, and 639 nm lasers. Data were processed with 
Kaluza analysis software (Beckman Coulter). For sorting, cells were collected in Hanks’ 
balanced salt solution with 20% FBS, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL 
streptomycin (15070-063, Gibco), and then, cells were sorted by a cell sorter (MoFlo 
AstriosEQ; Beckman Coulter) 
 
Fluorescence imaging 
HeLa cells expressing muGFP-ATG2A and WIPI2B-HaloTag7 were seeded onto 
glass-bottom dishes (3911-035, IWAKI) 48 h before observation. Cells were cultured in 
starvation medium with 200 nM SF650-conjugated HaloTag ligand (A308-02, Goryo 
Chemical) and LipidTOX Red (H34476, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the time 
indicated. Then, cells were observed using a confocal laser microscope (FV3000, 
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective lens (1.42 NA, 
Olympus). Obtained images were processed using the Fiji image processing package 
(70). Each cell was isolated in a single image and processed individually. After being 
convolved with the Gaussian Blur filter in Fiji (sigma= 2), images were processed with 
the Top Hat filter (radius = 10). A threshold was determined for each channel and 
applied to all images in each channel to binarize images. Binarized images were 
processed by the Watershed filter, and then puncta were identified and counted by the 
Analyze Particles tool. Colocalized puncta were visualized by applying the Multiply 
function in Fiji’s Image Calculator to two binarized images of interest and then counted 
using Analyze Particles again.  
 
3D correlative light and electron microscopy 
To observe and measure autophagosomes, 3D correlative light and electron microscopy 
(3D-CLEM) analysis was performed as described previously (46). Briefly, gridded 
coverslip-bottom dishes (TCI-3922-035R-1CS, a custom-made product based on 
3922-035, with cover glass attached in the opposite direction, IWAKI, Sizuoka, Japan) 
were coated with carbon by a vacuum evaporator (IB-29510VET, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) 
and treated with 10 μg/mL poly-L-lysine for 15 min, followed by UV irradiation. Cells 
were seeded onto the custom-made glass-base dishes 48 h prior to the experiment. After 
incubation in the starvation medium for 1 h, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde 
(26126-54, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (G018/1, TAAB) in

0.1 M PB, pH7.4 for 1 h at 4℃. Then, cells were observed using a confocal laser 
microscope (FV3000, Olympus) equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective lens (1.42 
NA, Olympus). After obtaining fluorescence images, the cells were embedded in epoxy 
resin for observation with an electron microscope as described previously. After cells 
were embedded and removal of the coverslip, the resin block was trimmed into a 150 
μm × 150 μm square, which included the area observed by the confocal laser 
microscope (FV3000, Olympus). Then, the block was cut to a 25-nm thickness to create 
a ribbon of 50–200 serial sections using a ultramicrotome (EM UC7, Leica, Wetzlar, 
Germany) equipped with a diamond knife (Ultra JUMBO, 45 degrees, DiATOME, 
Hatfield, PA). Those sections were observed by a scanning electron microscope 
(JSM7900, JEOL) with the assistance of Array Tomography Supporter software 
(System in Frontier, Tokyo, Japan). The images were stacked in order using Stacker 
NEO TEMography.com 3.3.4.0 software (System in Frontier). The alignment of the 
images obtained with the confocal laser microscope and the electron microscope was 
done using Fiji software. The maximum cross-sectional areas of autophagosomes were 
also measured using Fiji software. The observation of autophagosomes, the 
quantification of autophagosome sizes, and the statistical analysis were performed in a 
double-blinded manner.   
 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad 
Software, Boston, MA). The statistical method used for each experiment is described in 
each figure legend.

Figure 1. Analysis of autophagic flux in WIPI KO cells.   
(A) Schematic representation of the Halo processing assay. Halo–GFP and Halo–LC3 
are incorporated into autophagosomes non-selectively and selectively, respectively. 
Without ligand binding, these reporters are degraded in autolysosomes. In contrast, after 
ligand binding, Halo becomes stable and accumulates in autolysosomes, the amount of 
which reflects autophagic flux.   
(B and D) Halo–GFP and Halo–LC3 processing assay. Cells stably expressing 
Halo–GFP (B) or Halo–LC3 (D) were labeled for 30 min with 100 nM 
tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-conjugated Halo ligand and then were incubated in 
starvation medium for 4 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with the 
indicated antibodies or in-gel fluorescence detection. WT, wild-type. 
(C and E) Results from (B) and (D) were quantified. The Halo–GFP/LC3 processing 
rate was calculated as the band intensity of processed Halo over that of 
Halo–GFP/LC3.The plots show the Halo–GFP/LC3 processing rate of each cell line 
relative to that in WT cells. Solid bars indicate the means, and dots indicate the data 
from three independent experiments. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way 
ANOVA with Dunnett’s test (C) or the Holm-Šídák test (E).

Figure 7. The magnitude of autophagy defects in WIPI4 mutants is possibly 
associated with the severity of neurodevelopmental symptoms but not with the age 
of neurodegeneration onset. 
The autophagic activity (%WT in Figure 6B) of corresponding WIPI4 mutants and the 
age of the onset of neurodegeneration symptoms, such as parkinsonism and dementia, 
were plotted for seven BPAN cases. The parenthetical after each mutation indicates the 
age of the onset of these symptoms. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between 
the degree of autophagic defect and the age of the onset of these symptoms is shown. 
 
Figure 8. Proposed functions of PROPPINs. 
In yeast, Atg21 recruits Atg16, and Atg18 and possibly Hsv2 recruit Atg2. Atg18 is 
essential, and Atg21 is partially essential for autophagy. Hsv2 is dispensable for 
autophagy. In mammals, WIPI2 is predominantly important for autophagy, at least 
through binding with ATG16L1. WIPI1 may be partially redundant with this function of 
WIPI2. WIPI4 and possibly WIPI3 are important for the recruitment of ATG2A/B to the 
site of autophagosome formation. ATG2A/B recruitment is partially achieved through 
binding with ATG8. Phylogenetically related proteins are shown in the same colors 
(black or gray).

Figure S1. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout was confirmed by genomic DNA 
sequencing and immunoblotting. 
(A–I) Genomic DNA sequences of targeted regions are shown. Insertions are 
highlighted in red, and deletions are indicated by dashes. Frameshift mutations were 
confirmed in WIPI1 KO, WIPI2 KO, WIPI3 KO, WIPI4 KO, WIPI1/2 DKO, WIPI3/4 
DKO, and WIPI1–4 QKO HEK293T cells. In ATG16L1 KO HEK293T cells, a 
frameshift mutation was detected in one allele and an in-frame deletion involving a 
splice site was detected in the other. In ATG2A/B DKO HEK293T cells, frameshift 
mutations were detected in both alleles of ATG2A genes. In ATG2B genes, a frameshift 
mutation was detected in one allele, and an in-frame mutation disrupting an initiator 
codon was detected in the other. (J) Immunoblotting of total cell lysates of the indicated 
HEK293T cell lines is shown. No commercially available antibody can detect 
endogenous WIPI1 and WIPI3. 
 
Figure S2. The LC3 and p62 turnover and GFP–LC3–RFP reporter methods did 
not reveal a decrease in autophagic flux in WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells. 
(A) WT and WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells were incubated for 4 h in regular or 
starvation medium with or without 100 nM bafilomycin A .

(B) and (C) The band intensities of LC3-II and p62 normalized with those of HSP90 
were quantified. Data from three experiments are plotted. Data were statistically 
analyzed by Welch’s t-test. 
(D) Schematic representations of the measurement of autophagic flux using the 
GFP–LC3–RFP reporter. GFP–LC3–RFP is cleaved by ATG4 family proteins to 
produce equimolar amounts of GFP–LC3 and RFP. GFP–LC3 is efficiently engulfed 
and degraded by autophagosomes, while RFP remains in the cytosol and serves as an 
internal control. The reduction of the GFP:RFP ratio reflects the autophagic flux.   
(E) WT and WIPI3/4 DKO HEK293T cells stably expressing GFP–LC3–RFP were 
incubated for 12 h in regular or starvation medium. The fluorescence intensity of GFP 
and RFP were determined by flow cytometry. Geometric means of the fluorescence 
intensity of GFP over that of RFP (GFP:RFP ratio) were calculated and normalized with 
the values in regular medium. Data from three experiments were statistically analyzed 
by Welch’s t-test.

Figure 1. Analysis of autophagic flux in WIPI KO cells.
(A) Schematic representation of the Halo processing assay. Halo–GFP and Halo–LC3 are incorporated into autophagosomes non-selectively 
and selectively, respectively. Without ligand binding, these reporters are degraded in autolysosomes. In contrast, after ligand binding Halo 
becomes stable and accumulates in autolysosomes, the amount of which reflects autophagic flux. 
(B and D) Halo–GFP and Halo–LC3 processing assay. Cells stably expressing Halo–GFP(B) or Halo–LC3 (D) were labeled for 30 min with 100 
nM tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-conjugated Halo ligand and then were incubated in starvation medium for 4 h. Total cell lysates were subjected 
to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies or in-gel fluorescence detection. Wild-type, WT.
(C and E) Results from (B) and (D) were quantified. The Halo–GFP/LC3 processing rate was calculated as the band intensity of processed Halo 
over that of Halo–GFP/LC3. The plots show the Halo–GFP/LC3 processing rate of each cell line relative to that in WT cells. Solid bars indicate 
the means and dots indicate the data from three independent experiments. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’ s

Figure 5. The recruitment of ATG2A to phagophores is mediated by its interaction with WIPI4 and ATG8s.
(A) HeLa cells stably expressing muGFP–ATG2A or the indicated ATG2A mutants with WIPI2B–Halo were observed by confocal microscopy 
after being incubated in starvation medium with 200 nM SF650-conjugated HaloTag ligand and LipidTOX Red for 1 h. Arrows indicate the 
colocalization of a muGFP–ATG2A punctum with a WIPI2B–HaloSF650 punctum. Arrowheads indicate the colocalization of puncta of 
muGFP–ATG2A or ATG2A mutants with LipidTOX Red puncta. Scale bar indicate 10 μm (main image) and 1 μm (inset).
(B) The ratio of WIPI2B–HaloSF650 puncta colocalizing with muGFP puncta was calculated. Data were collected from more than 90 cells for 
ATG2A or ATG2A mutants. The box plot denotes the median and 2.5–97.5 percentile, while outliers were plotted individually. Data were 
statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test.
(C) Structures of ATG2A, the mLIRΔWIR mutant, and ATG2A mLIRΔWIR fused with the 2×FYVE domain or WIPI4. 
(D) The Halo–GFP processing assay of ATG2A/B DKO HEK293T cells expressing the indicated proteins was performed as in Figure 1B.
(E) Data from (D) were quantified and the results are shown as described in Figure1C. Solid bars indicate the means and dots indicate the data 
from three independent experiments. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’ s test.

Age at the onset of neurodegeneration
Figure 7. The magnitude of autophagy defect in WIPI4 mutants is possibly associated with the severity of neurodevelopmental 
symptoms but not with the age of neurodegeneration onset.
The autophagic activity (%WT in Figure 6B) of corresponding WIPI4 mutants and the age of the onset of neurodegeneration symptoms, such as 
parkinsonism and dementia, were plotted for seven BPAN cases. The parenthetical after each mutation indicates the age of the onset of these 
symptoms. The Pearson’ s correlation coefficient (r) between the degree of autophagic defect and the age of the onset of these symptoms is 
shown.

Figure 8. Proposed functions of PROPPINs.
In yeast, Atg21 recruites Atg16, and Atg18 and possibly Hsv2 recruit Atg2. Atg18 is essential and Atg21 is partially essential. Hsv2 is 
dispensable for autophagy. In mammals, WIPI2 is predominantly important for autophagy, at least through binding with ATG16L1. WIPI1 may 
be partially redundant with this function of WIPI2. WIPI4 and possibly WIPI3 are important for the recruitment of ATG2A/B to the site of 
autophagosome formation. ATG2A/B recruitment is partially achieved through binding with ATG8. Phylogenetically-related proteins are shown in  
the same colors (black or gray).
