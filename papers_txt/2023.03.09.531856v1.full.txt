Summary 
 
Chromatin-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to define 
chromatin  density,  regulate  gene  expression,  and  are  involved  in  the  initiation  and 
progression  of  various  cancer  types.  Despite  the  wealth  of  studies  describing 
transcriptome changes upon lncRNA modulation, little data is showing the direct effects 
of lncRNA on regulatory elements (REs) that drive gene expression. Here we explored 
the molecular mechanism of the chromatin-interacting lncRNA, MALAT1, through RNA- 
and ATAC-seq, using HeLa cells as a model system. Time-resolved MALAT1 knock-down 
assays revealed its direct regulation of a limited number of protein-coding genes. Loss of 
MALAT1 resulted in a substantial loss of chromatin accessibility downstream of the 
NR4A1 gene, associated with its down-regulation. CRISPR-i assays revealed that this 
region corresponds to a new downstream RE. Next, using TCGA data, we identified a 
direct  correlation  between  the  expression  of  NR4A1  and  the  accessibility  of  the 
downstream RE in breast cancer. The molecular mechanism was validated on estrogen 
receptor  (ER)  positive  breast  cancer  cells  (MCF7)  and  Pancreatic  Duct  Epithelioid 
Carcinoma (PANC1) cells, not showing this effect according to TCGA data. Indeed, 
MALAT1 regulates the expression of NR4A1 in a cell type-specific manner by changing 
the accessibility of the downstream RE. MALAT1 exhibits a molecular mechanism that 
fine-tunes the expression of cancer drivers, like NR4A1, in ER-positive breast cancer 
cells, but not in other cell types.

Introduction 
Histones, chromatin-associated proteins, and RNA play essential roles in fine-tuning gene 
expression.  Among  them,  chromatin-associated  RNAs  have  arisen  as  key  factors 
modulating nuclear architecture, genome-wide chromatin interactions, gene expression, 
and genomic integrity (1). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts of at least 
200 nucleotides in length, transcribed by RNA polymerase II, in most cases spliced, 3’ 
polyadenylated, and 5’ capped by 7-methyl guanosine (2). LncRNAs act as cis- or trans-
acting transcriptional regulators depending on their functional interactions with chromatin, 
chromatin-associated factors, and nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (3). Combining the 
information from different databases, almost 57.000 lncRNA genes have been described 
to generate more than 127.000 different transcripts from the human genome (4). Their 
expression is highly tissue and cell-type specific. The regulation of stem cell differentiation 
and renewal, in combination with specific protein partners, demonstrates their remarkable 
transcriptional  regulatory  potential  (5).  Lineage  engagement  for  adipose,  skeletal, 
cartilage, muscle, neuronal, and skin cell differentiation, in addition to embryonic stem 
cell  pluripotency,  have  been  described  guided  by  different  lncRNAs  like  PU.1  AS, 
Msx1as, HOTTIP, H19, HOTAIRM1, TINCR, RoR, Xist, Airn, and Firre, among others 
(54).  Accordingly,  it  is  not  surprising  that  lncRNAs  were  linked  with  the  onset  and 
progression  of  cancer,  regulating  gene  expression  at  transcriptional  and  post-
transcriptional levels, and impacting the intermediary metabolism and cell signaling (2,6–
8).  
The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1, is one of the 
most abundant lncRNAs in human cells, being located in nuclear speckles (9). In humans, 
MALAT1 is an 8 Kb single exon transcript expressed from chromosome 11q13 (10). 
Studies on the mouse homolog of the human  MALAT1 gene showed the RNaseP-
RNaseZ post-transcriptional processing of MALAT1, to generate a long transcript retained 
on nuclear speckles and a 61 nt small RNA with a tRNA-like structure (11). Interestingly, 
after RNase processing, the 3’ end of the highly expressed long MALAT1 transcript, folds 
to generate a blunt-end triple helical structure that stabilizes the transcript through the 
protection from 3’-to-5’ exonucleases (12,13).

Different  transcriptional-related  processes  are  regulated  by  MALAT1.  RNA-RNA 
interactions characterized by RNA Antisense Purification (RAP) sequencing experiments 
in mouse embryonic stem cells, showed that MALAT1 interacts mainly with pre-mRNAs. 
This interaction is mediated through proteins involved in alternative splicing, like the 
arginine/serine-rich  phosphoproteins  (SR  proteins)  (14).  Accordingly,  MALAT1  is 
predicted  to  regulate  pre-mRNA  splicing  through  the  interaction  with  SR  proteins, 
modulating their phosphorylation status, and influencing the distribution of other splicing 
factors in human cells (15). Comparing the results of RAP sequencing in mouse cells with 
data obtained by Capture Hybridization Analysis of RNA Targets (CHART) in MCF7 
breast cancer cells, MALAT1 was found to interact also with DNA at numerous genomic 
sites. MALAT1 is preferentially associated with the coding region and termination or 
polyadenylation sites of transcriptionally active and spliced genes (14,16). Moreover, 
combining  mass  spectrometry  with  the  CHART  assay  (CHART-MS),  revealed  the 
preferential interaction of MALAT1 with RNA processing factors, like nuclear speckle and 
paraspeckle proteins, and transcriptional regulators (16). 
Different types of cancers have been associated with alterations of MALAT1 expression 
and/or function. MALAT1 was shown to act as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter, 
depending on the cancer type examined, or it can even have opposing roles in the same 
cancer type (6,17,18). The diversity of MALAT1 functions may be explained by its binding 
to  regulatory  genomic  domains,  its  interaction  with  chromatin-modifying  complexes, 
leading to the deposition of active or inactive histone marks, or  its interaction with 
transcription factors that directly target gene regulatory elements (19–21). These data 
indicate that MALAT1 is associated with the regulation of gene expression during cancer 
development. Nevertheless, despite the diverse effects of lncRNAs (1), the molecular 
mechanism of MALAT1 function on gene expression in cancer is still unresolved. 
In this study, we used HeLa cells as a model system to validate MALAT1 association with 
active chromatin. Then, modulating MALAT1 expression with Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) 
Gapmers, we defined direct and indirect transcript targets by RNA-seq. These targets 
exhibited changes in chromatin accessibility of key regulatory elements as shown by 
ATAC-seq.  Using  the  CRISPR-i  technology,  we  found  that  MALAT1  modulates  the 
accessibility of a downstream regulatory element of the nuclear receptor subfamily 4

Group A Member 1 (NR4A1). NR4A1 is a transcription factor dysregulated in different 
cancer types, involved in T-cell dysfunction, and associated with the development of 
fibrotic diseases (22–27). We correlated chromatin accessibility changes at the NR4A1-
RE with NR4A1 gene expression using TCGA data. Interestingly, we observed a direct 
correlation  for  certain  cancer  types,  such  as  breast  cancer,  but  not  for  others. 
Furthermore, we confirmed this specific cancer-type association using CRIPR-i, showing 
that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), are not regulated by MALAT1 and do 
not change the expression of NR4A1. However, the NR4A1 gene in MCF7 breast cancer 
cells  was  specifically  regulated  by  MALAT1.  These  results  delineate  the  MALAT1 
molecular mechanism that fine-tunes the expression of specific cancer modulators, like 
NR4A1.  
 
Results 
 
MALAT1 is a chromatin-associated lncRNA linked to the regulation of protein-
coding genes  
MALAT1 has been described as a chromatin-associated lncRNA, using different RNA-
centered  experimental  approaches  based  on  proximity  ligation  or  antisense 
oligonucleotides (14,16,28–31). We performed a chromatin-centered method to identify 
lncRNAs associated with active chromatin. To isolate the active fraction of chromatin, the 
nuclei of crosslinked HeLa cells were isolated and the cytoplasmic RNA background was 
removed by several wash steps (Figure 1A). The active chromatin fraction was pulled 
down with antibodies directed against H3K27ac. As a negative control, the H3K27ac 
antibody was pre-bound with the acetylated H3 peptide to block epitope binding (Figure 
1B).  The  chromatin-associated  RNA  was  purified  and  analyzed  by  automated 
electrophoresis (Figure 1C). The input (RNAs from the nuclear extract) and negative 
control samples showed the same RNA distribution pattern, while the RNAs associated 
with H3K27ac marked chromatin revealed a different pattern, being highly enriched in 
RNAs of around 200 nucleotides (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1A). RNAs were used 
for library preparation and sequencing (ChRIP-seq) (32,33). Quantification of the RNAs 
revealed that the H3K27ac-associated RNAs are highly enriched in promoter-derived 
protein-coding transcripts when compared to Input and the negative control (Figures 1D,

1E, Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, about 5% of these transcripts correspond to 
lncRNAs (Figures 1D, Supplementary Table 1). We identified several lncRNAs that have 
been previously associated with chromatin, like MALAT1, NEAT1, Firre, and TARID (16, 
54, 55) (Figures 1F and Supplementary Table 1). We further focused our study on 
MALAT1, being specifically enriched within H3K27Ac-associated transcripts, compared 
to input and negative control ChRIP data (Figure 1G). Next, the MALAT1-H3K27Ac 
interaction was validated by real-time PCR analysis of the ChRIP samples (Figure 1H). 
To identify direct and indirect transcriptional-target genes, we used LNA Gapmers to 
knock down (Kd) MALAT1 and control Gapmers to target LacZ. The MALAT1 Kd effects 
were assessed by RNA-seq and real-time PCR at 24- and 48-hours post-transfection 
(Figures 1I and 1J). These techniques validated the efficient MALAT1 Kd at both time 
points.  Interestingly,  after  24  hours,  the  MALAT1  Kd  revealed  a  higher  number  of 
downregulated transcripts (313) compared to upregulated ones (143). Among them, the 
vast majority of differentially expressed transcripts correspond to protein-coding genes 
(Figures 1K, 1L, and Supplementary Table 2). After 48 hours, the number of differentially 
expressed  transcripts  strongly  increases,  reaching  similar  levels  for  up-  and  down-
regulated transcripts (Figures 1K and 1L). At this time point, besides the preponderance 
of protein-coding genes, we started to observe the differential expression of non-coding 
genes  (Figure  1L  and  Supplementary  Tables  3-4).  Gene  ontology  analysis  by 
overrepresentation test (56, 57) of the 48 hours sample revealed that up-regulated genes 
are enriched in transcripts being associated with transcriptional regulation, compared to 
the 24-hour sample (Supplementary Figures 1B and 1C). The differences observed 
between the 24h and 48h time points suggest two important aspects of the function of 
this lncRNA. First, MALAT1 is primarily associated with the regulation of protein-coding 
genes. Second, the time-dependent changes of the effects suggest the presence of early 
direct targets (after 24h) and the emergence of indirect targets 48 hours after knock-down, 
when transcriptional regulators (proteins and nc-RNAs) show up.    
These results validate that MALAT1 is a chromatin-associated lncRNA bound to active 
chromatin, regulating the expression of specific protein-coding genes.

MALAT1  modulates  the  chromatin  accessibility  of  an  NR4A1  downstream 
regulatory element 
To understand the effects after MALAT1 downregulation and to address the chromatin 
structure of the target genes, we performed ATAC-seq experiments 24 and 48 hours after 
MALAT1 Kd. By comparing the accessibility changes between both time points, we 
identified genomic loci that become inaccessible 24 hours after MALAT1 Kd and maintain 
this condition after 48 hours (Figure 2A, Cluster 4). Considering time-dependent changes 
in gene expression after MALAT1 downregulation, and the presence of putative direct 
MALAT1 targets after 24 hours of Kd, we focused on the early structure changes. 
Compared to the controls we identified numerous significantly altered ATAC sites with 
increased  or  decreased  chromatin  accessibility,  distributed  over  all  chromosomes 
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Nevertheless, these sites were not randomly distributed 
throughout the genome. Quantification of the ATAC-site distribution showed significant 
enrichments (Chromosome 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17, and 20) or reductions (Chromosome 
4, 9, 13, 14, 16, 21, and X) of ATAC peak density (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the sites that 
change their accessibility already after 24 hours of MALAT1 knock-down were enriched 
in regulatory elements. Analyzing chromatin states, our data show that enhancers are the 
main regulatory elements affected after the MALAT1 downregulation. This was observed 
for both pools, ATAC sites that gained (Figure 2C) and lost (Figure 2D) accessibility after 
24 hours of MALAT1 Kd. Analyzing the correlation between gene expression changes 
and changes in chromatin accessibility, revealed a higher overlap between chromatin 
closure and transcription de-regulation than the other way around (Figure 2E). This 
indicates that the sites that become less accessible after MALAT1 Kd have a stronger 
impact on gene expression compared to the sites that gain accessibility.  
We now focused on two such sites, exhibiting the largest decrease in accessibility after 
24 hours of MALAT1 Kd (Figure 2F, dots inside the blue oval). These sites are part of 
cluster 4 (Figure 2A), and these are located on chromosome 12, a chromosome exhibiting 
a higher number of repressed sites than average (Figure 2G). The repressed ATAC-sites 
are  located  downstream  of  the  NR4A1  gene  (Chr12:  52.022.832-52.059.507  on 
GRCh38), in a region flanked by additional strong ATAC-peaks and coinciding with CTCF-
ChIP-seq peaks (red and black squares, respectively, Figure 3A). This region may relate

to a topologically-associated domain (TAD), in which the NR4A1 and ATG101 genes are 
expressed as observed by our RNA-seq data (Figure 3A). Additionally, the active histone 
marks  H3K27Ac/H3K4me3/H3K4me1  sign  the  NR4A1  and  ATG101  promoters, and 
enhancer regions up and downstream of the genes (Figure 3B). Cap-Analysis of Gene 
Expression (CAGE) data on HeLa cells showed the location of the transcriptional start 
site,  corresponding  to  the  NR4A1  transcript  ENST00000394825.  The  promoter  and 
coding region of this transcript covers the whole ATAC-accessible region, including the 
downstream element (Supplementary Figure 2B).   
MALAT1 Kd resulted in a significant downregulation of the NR4A1 gene, without changing 
the expression rates of ATG101 (Figure 1K, Supplementary Table 2). This effect was 
verified  by  RT-qPCR  (Figure  3C),  suggesting  a  direct,  MALAT1-dependent  loss  of 
chromatin accessibility at a novel NR4A1-downstream regulatory element (Figure 3B, 
black box). To test the functionality of the proposed RE, we used the CRISPR-i system, 
consisting of the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and three independent guide RNAs 
(gRNAs) targeting the NR4A1 downstream regulatory element (Figure 3D). Guide RNAs 
were designed to bind directly to the proposed RE (gRNA2), or 1 kbp (gRNA1) and 2 kbp 
(gRNA3) downstream of the RE. HeLa cells were independently transfected with the three 
guides RNA plasmids (Supplementary Figure 3A) and dCas9. Real-time PCR analysis 
showed repression of NR4A1 expression with all three guide RNAs, with gRNA 2 hitting 
the RE being the most efficient guide RNA (Figure 3E). The results indicate the presence 
of a potential novel downstream regulatory element, regulating the expression of the 
NR4A1 gene.   
Next, we tested whether the MALAT1 RNA is physically associated with the downstream 
regulatory element of the NR4A1 gene, asking whether the lncRNA maintains DNA 
accessibility at this locus. Using the RAP assay we pulled down MALAT1 from HeLa 
nuclear extract (Supplementary Figure 2B). However, we did not find a direct-physical 
interaction of MALAT1 with the NR4A1 downstream regulatory element (Supplementary 
Figure 2C), suggesting that additional factors mediate chromatin closure.  
Taken together, the results show that MALAT1 regulates the accessibility of a novel 
downstream regulatory element, fine-tuning the expression of NR4A1 transcripts in HeLa 
cells.

Chromatin accessibility of the NR4A1 downstream regulatory element correlates 
with NR4A1 expression in different cancer types 
To address the functional role of the newly identified downstream regulatory region of the 
NR4A1 gene we screened the TCGA cancer database. Indeed, we observed an overlap 
between the RE and 2 ATAC-seq peaks derived from TCGA data (58) (Figure 4A). The 
intensity of both ATAC-seq peaks does positively correlate with NR4A1 expression overall 
cancer types (Figure 4B). Furthermore, analyzing the accessibility of the two ATAC peaks 
in individual cancer types, showed that the accessibility of this region was cancer-type 
specific  (Figure  4C).  The  highest  level  of  accessibility  was  observed  for 
Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PCPG) and the lowest ATAC-seq scores were 
found for Kidney Renal Papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) (Figure 4C). These cancer-
specific effects led us to evaluate the correlation of accessibility for both peaks versus 
NR4A1 expression in different cancer types. Here we identified a strong correlation for 
Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) when compared to other cancer types (Figure 4D). 
The direct correlations between NR4A1 expression, and the accessibility of NR4A1 
downstream  regulatory  element  (NR4A1-RE),  define  a  MALAT1/NR4A1  axis  that, 
according to our initial results in HeLa cells and the bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data, 
suggest the MALAT1 regulation of NR4A1 expression through accessibility changes in 
the downstream element in a cancer-specific manner. 
 
The MALAT1-NR4A1 axis is functional on breast MCF7, but not on pancreatic 
PANC1, cancer cells. 
To prove the hypothesis of a cancer-type specific MALAT1/NR4A1-RE axis of NR4A1 
expression, we evaluated the effect in specific cancer cell types. We tested cancer types 
exhibiting a high correlation of MALAT1 expression and NR4A1-RE accessibility, such as 
BRCA (Figure 4E), versus low- or no-correlation, like pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
(Figure 5A). To assess the functionality of the MALAT1/NR4A1-RE axis, we transfected 
Gapmers to downregulate MALAT1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells and PANC1 pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma cells (Figure 5B). MALAT1 Kd induces a significant decrease in NR4A1 
expression in MCF7 cells, while no difference compared to the controls was observed in

PANC1 cells (Figure 5C). Furthermore, we evaluated the regulatory function of the 
NR4A1 downstream regulatory element. As described in Figure 3C, we transfected 
dCas9 and gRNA2 into MCF7 cells (Figure 5D) and evaluated the expression of NR4A1. 
A significant reduction in the expression of NR4A1 was observed (Figure 5E). Meaning 
that the NR4A1 downstream element is sufficient to modulate the expression of the 
NR4A1 gene in MCF7 cells.  
 
Discussion 
Chromatin-associated  lncRNAs  are  of  key  importance  in  the  regulation  of  cellular 
transcriptional  levels.  During  cancer  onset  and  progression,  altered  transcriptional 
programs  trigger  uncontrolled  intracellular  signaling  that  normally  induces  cell  de-
differentiation and proliferation (36–38). In this context, MALAT1 has been involved in 
different cancer types, acting as a transcriptional regulator of oncogenes and tumor 
suppressors (6,17,18). Our work focused on deciphering the molecular mechanism of 
gene expression regulation of the chromatin-associated lncRNA MALAT1.  
 
MALAT1-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility  
We found that the presence of MALAT1 was essential for the expression of many protein-
coding genes. With the knock-down of the lncRNA alterations in chromatin accessibility 
of a large number of loci were observed. Such an increase or decrease in chromatin 
accessibility after a lncRNA Kd has been described before (34,35,39,40), confirming that 
lncRNAs are active chromatin regulators. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there is no 
study showing the impact of MALAT1 on chromatin accessibility. The ATAC-seq data 
identified the largest changes in chromatin accessibility downstream of the NR4A1 gene. 
The local decrease within an open 36 kbp region, was associated with the repression of 
the NR4A1 gene expression. We showed that this MALATA1-dependent ATAC-seq peak 
presents  a  new  NR4A1  downstream  regulatory  element  (NR4A1-RE),  as  CRISPR-i 
experiments targeting the NR4A1-RE also downregulated the expression of the gene. 
Similar types of REs have been reported to regulate Cja1 (Cx43) and mouse Globin genes 
(42,43). MALAT1 RAP assays could not detect the physical interaction of MALAT1 with 
the NR4A1 locus, suggesting that MALAT1 does not directly maintain the open chromatin

structure of the NR4A1-RE in HeLa cells. MALAT1 CHART-seq data did not identify the 
interaction of MALAT1 with the NR4A1-RE in ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells, 
confirming our findings (Supplementary Figure 4A) (16). Our ATAC-seq data showed that 
the NR4A1 promoter and the NR4A1-RE of NR4A1, correspond to a region with the 
highest level of chromatin accessibility of the whole chromosome 12. The decrease in 
accessibility of the NR4A1-RE after MALAT1 Kd involves additional factors that maintain 
this  region  accessible  under  normal  conditions.  Data  retrieved  from  the  ChIP-atlas 
(https://chip-atlas.org/) in HeLa cells, revealed that the transcription activator BRG1, the 
catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNIF chromatin remodeling complex, binds along the whole 
NR4A1  gene  body,  including  the  NR4A1-RE  (Supplementary  Figure  4B).  A  direct 
MALAT1-BRG1 interaction was previously shown to increase the inflammatory response 
in hepatocellular carcinoma (44). Besides BRG1, two other transcription factors involved 
in the super elongation complex of RNA polymerase II, AFF4 and ELL2 (45), are also 
binding  to  the  NR4A1  gene  body  and  the  NR4A1-RE  (Supplementary  Figure  4C). 
MALAT1 Kd resulted in a minor decrease of BRG1 and AFF4 expression, but with a 
significant down-regulation of ELL2 (Supplementary Figure 4D and Supplementary Table 
2). The putative MALAT1-BRG1 interaction and the slight expression changes could 
explain the MALAT1-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility at the NR4A1-RE. 
Nevertheless, apart from additional protein factors, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
other ncRNAs are involved in maintaining this region accessible. 
A recent report describes the expression of an antisense lncRNA to NR4A1, NR4A1AS, 
in colorectal cancer cells (46). The promoter region of NR4A1AS1 coincides with the 
NR4A1-RE, making this lncRNA an interesting candidate to follow up in a subsequent 
study. However, our RNA-seq data did not reveal the presence of this lncRNA in HeLa 
cells. Moreover, the result was verified by real-time PCR assays in HeLa and also MCF7 
cells, not detecting the NR4A1AS RNA (data not shown). These results indicate that 
NR4A1AS  is not  involved  in the  presented  model systems,  but most  probably,  the 
antisense RNA plays a tissue-specific role.  
 
Impact of the MALAT1-NR4A1 axis on breast cancer development.

TCGA  data  revealed  that  the  chromatin  accessibility  of  the  NR4A1-RE  is  directly 
correlated with NR4A1 expression in several cancer types as we observed in HeLa cells. 
Here, we focused on breast carcinoma cells due to their high correlation. We were able 
to recapitulate the MALAT1-NR4A1 axis in ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells and did 
not find it in pancreatic adenocarcinoma PANC1 cells, as predicted by the TCGA data.  
The function of MALAT1 expression in breast cancer cells is still a matter of debate. Both, 
oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles have been described for this lncRNA (47). Despite 
this disagreement, MALAT1 was shown to be chromatin-associated in two different breast 
cancer types, ER-positive MCF7 and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 
cells (16,30). Our results agree with the role of MALAT1 as a tumor suppressor, by 
maintaining the NR4A1 expression in MCF7 cells. On the one hand, NR4A1 upholds the 
ERK signaling at low levels and preserves the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, regulating 
proliferation and controlled cell death, respectively (27). Through these mechanisms, 
NR4A1 seems to retain the tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF7 cells (27). On the other hand, 
in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells, NR4A1 acts in a different manner. NR4A1 is promoting 
tumor invasion and metastasis by activating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-R) 
signaling (26). These results suggest that depending on the cellular environment, the 
MALAT1-NR4A1 axis can work as a tumor promoter or suppressor (Figure 5F). 
The transcription factor NR4A1 has been described as an immediate early gene (IEG), 
which corresponds to a group of genes that rapidly respond to stress through their fast 
and  transient  transcriptional  stimulation  (48).  Replication  stress  in  the  absence  of 
checkpoints and quality control machinery is one of the first steps leading to genomic 
instability during cancer development (49). Comparing non-malignant MCF10 breast 
epithelial cells with TNBC cells MDA-MB-231, and circulating patient-derived breast tumor 
cells, NR4A1 has been recently reported to modulate the IEG’s expression through the 
interaction with their gene bodies and suppressing their transcriptional elongation. While 
under oncogenic replication stress conditions, NR4A1 is released, triggering a burst of 
IEG’s expression (50). 
Together, the data pinpoints to a mechanism where MALAT1 modulates the accessibility 
of a downstream regulatory element (NR4A1-RE) to determine NR4A1 expression levels. 
The presence of MALAT1 seems to fine-tune the NR4A1 expression levels, which in turn,

The discovery of the MALAT1-NR4A1 axis increases their potential as therapeutic targets 
for ER-positive breast cancer and drug-resistance treatments.

Material and Methods 
Cell Culture 
HeLa, MCF7, and PANC1 cells were cultured in HyClone Dubelco’s Modified Eagle 
Medium (DMEM), supplemented with glucose 4.5 g/L, L-Glutamine 584 mg/L, sodium 
pyruvate 110 mg./L, and 10% Fetal bovine Serum. Cells are maintained under constant 
conditions of 37°C and 5% CO  and subcultured using Trypsin 0.25%.

Nuclear preparations 
HeLa nuclear preparations were performed following the REAP (Rapid, Efficient And 
Practical) protocol (51) with modifications for crosslinked cells. In brief, twenty million 
HeLa cells were harvested in 1 mL of PBS 0.2% NP-40 supplemented with protease and 
RNase inhibitors. Then, two washes of the cytoplasmic fraction are made by pipetting 
up/down, vortexing, 10 times pipetting with a 1 mL syringe and 23G needle, and 12.000xg 
centrifugation for 30 seconds. Finally, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 500 µL of 
RIPA  buffer  (10  mM  Tris-HCl  [pH  7.6],  1  mM  EDTA,  0.1%  SDS,  0.1%  Sodium 
Deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) for sonication. 
 
Western Blot 
Protein extracts from HeLa and MCF7 cells were obtained after homogenization with 
RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors by pipetting and sonication at 4°C. The

proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes 
were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 ®), probed with antibodies 
against H3K27ac, Tubulin, and HA-tag, and then with horseradish peroxidase-coupled 
secondary antibodies. Luminescent blot signals were obtained by incubating with the 
peroxidase substrate and captured on a Syngene G:box Gel documentation system. 
 
Real-time PCR 
Total RNA (1 µg) from HeLa, MCF7, and PANC1 cells, or 500 µg of RNA from HeLa 
ChRIP and input samples, were used for cDNA preparation with the RevertAid RT Kit 
(Thermo Scientific). Real-time PCR reactions were prepared in 0.1 mL tubes with 20 µl 
of the final volume containing specific primers (MALAT1, NR4A1, GAPDH), variable 
amounts of cDNA (depending on the target), 10 µl of the 2X JumpStartTM ReadyMixTM, 1 
mM  MgCl ,  SyberGreen  (1:400.000  from  the  10.000X  stock,  Thermo  Scientific).

Reactions are analyzed on a Rotor-Gene RG3000 thermal cycler. 
 
Transfections  
HeLa  cells  were  reverse-transfected  with  Lipofectamine  2000  for  Gapmer-mediated 
MALAT1 downregulation and CRISPR-I assays. Gapmer transfections were carried out 
using 1.5 µl of 200 µM Gapmers against MALAT1 or LacZ and 5 µl of lipofectamine for 
1.2 million cells on a 6-well plate, for 24 hours post-transfection assays. For 48 hours 
post-transfection experiments, we used half the amount of cells. For CRISPR-i, we used 
5 µl of lipofectamine, 750 µg of dCas9 plasmid (#61355 Addgene), and 750 µg of each 
gRNA plasmid (#47108 Addgene) for 0.5 million cells on a 6-well plate. The cells were 
harvested 48 hours post-transfections. 
MCF7 cells were plated and transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 for Gapmer-mediated 
MALAT1 downregulation and CRISPR-I assays. Gapmer transfections were carried out 
using 2 µl of 200 µM Gapmers, against MALAT1 or LacZ, 2 µl of lipofectamine, and 1 µl 
of P3000 reagent, for 0.5 million cells seeded the day before on a 6 well plate. Cells were 
harvested 24 hours post-transfection. For CRISPR-i, we used 2 µl of lipofectamine, 650 
µg  of  dCas9  plasmid  (#47106  Addgene),  650  µg  of  each  gRNA  plasmid  (#47108

Addgene), and 2.5 µl of P3000 Reagent, for 0.5 million cells seeded the day before on a 
6 well plate. The cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfections. 
 
Chromatin-RNA Immunoprecipitation (ChRIP) 
Twenty million HeLa cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 8 minutes at room 
temperature with gentle agitation. Then, the reaction is quenched with 125 mM of glycine. 
Nuclei samples were prepared and sheared on a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode) at a 
medium intensity to obtain chromatin sizes between 200-800 bp. Sonicated samples were 
centrifuged at 8.000 x g for 30 seconds to eliminate nuclei debris, and the supernatant 
was  used  for  pre-clear  and  immunoprecipitation.  Pre-clearing  was  performed  by 
incubating the sonicated samples with protein-G dynabeads ® (Thermofisher) for 1 hour 
at 4°C on a rotator wheel. Pre-cleared samples were incubated with 5 µg of the H3K27Ac 
(Ab4729 Abcam), and as a negative control, we used the same H3K27Ac antibody 
preabsorbed with the peptide to raise it (Ab24404 Abcam). Immunoprecipitations were 
incubated for 4 hours at room temperature on a rotator wheel. Five percent of the 
immunoprecipitated samples were used for western blot analysis, and the rest of the 
sample was used for RNA purification. 
 
Custom genome 
A custom version of the hg38 human genome was used for all sequencing analysis, where 
all repeats of ribosomal genes were masked with N bases and a single repeat of the 
ribosomal gene was kept as an extra chromosome named “ChrR” (59). 
 
Annotation 
A custom version of the gencode v27 Homo Sapiens annotation was used, with ribosomal 
RNA present one time on an extra chromosome  - ChrR, to fit our custom genome.  
 
ChRIP-sequencing and pulldown analysis 
Raw files were first checked for quality and adapter contamination with fastqc v0.11.9 
(60) and multiqc v1.13 (61). Following the quality check, reads were aligned to the 
reference genome, hg38, using Bowtie2 (62) and the following flags: --local --very-

sensitive-local. Unmapped reads and reads with lower than 20 MAPQ mapping quality 
and reads mapping to ribosomal RNA were removed for downstream analysis, using 
Deeptools  alignmentSieve  v3.1.2  (63).  Next,  read  counts  were  obtained  with 
FeatureCount from the Subread package v2.0.0 (64), using the following flags: -s 1 -t 
gene -g gene_id. Differential binding analysis between the knockdown samples and the 
controls was performed in R v4.1.2 with the DEseq2 R package (65). The cutoff to 
determine significantly enriched transcripts was Log fold change >0.5 and FDR <0.1. 
 
RNA purification 
Total RNA purification for cDNA preparations was performed following TRIzol ® Reagent 
(Ambion  by  Life  Technologies)  manufacturer  instructions.  For  ChRIP  assays,  RNA 
purification from immunoprecipitated samples was extracted by resuspending the beads 
on proteinase K buffer (10% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4), and incubating 
them with 50 µg of Proteinase K for 1 hour at 50°C with gentle agitation. Then, the 
crosslinking was reversed at 65°C for 2 hours, followed by RNA purification with TRIzol 
and Isopropanol precipitation.  
 
RNA-sequencing and transcriptome analysis 
Raw files were first checked for quality and adapter contamination with fastqc v0.11.9 
(60) and multiqc v1.13 (61). Following the quality check, adapters were removed using 
Trimmomatic v0.38 (66), with the following flags: PE -phred33 ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-

Subread package v2.0.0 (64), using the following flags: -p -s 1 -t exon -g gene_id -C -B. 
Differential expression analysis between the knockdown samples and the controls was 
performed in R v4.1.2 with the DESeq2 R package (65), with apeglm shrinkage estimation 
for ranking of genes and visualization (70). Differential expressed genes were filtered with 
absolute Log fold change >1.0 and FDR <0.1. 
 
ATAC-seq assays, sequencing and analysis  
ATAC assay was performed following the instructions of the Omni-ATAC protocol (52), 
using the Nextera DNA Flex Library prep kit (Illumina). Tagmented DNA was analyzed on 
a bioanalyzer and sequenced on a Next-Seq 550 device in the Genomics core unit of the 
Regensburger Centrum für Interventionelle Immunologie.  
Raw files were first checked for quality and adapter contamination with fastqc v0.11.9 
(60) and multiqc v1.13 (61). Following the quality check, adapters were removed using 
Trimmomatic v0.38 (66). Paired-end reads were than mapped to the reference genome 
hg38, using Bowtie2 (62) with the following flags: --local --very-sensitive-local -X 5000 --
no-discordant –dovetail. Unmapped reads and reads with lower than 30 MAPQ mapping 
quality  were  removed  for  downstream  analysis,  using  samtools  v1.90  (69).  Reads 
mapping  to  the  chrM,  blacklisted  regions  and PCR  duplicates  were  removed  using 
samtools and Picard, respectively. Finally, reads were shifted based on Tn5 cuts, using 
DeepTools v3.1.2 (63) alignmentSieve --ATACshift. Peak calling was performed using 
MACS2 v2.2.71 (71), with the following flags: callpeak -f BAMPE -g hs –broad –keep-dup 
all  –buffer-size=100. Differentially  accessible  regions  were  obtained  with  DiffBind  R 
package. Differentially accessible regions were filtered with absolute Log fold change 
>1.0 and FDR <0.01. Regulatory regions were assigned to genes, using the GREAT tool 
(72), by basal plus extension method (5 kb upstream, 1 kb downstream plus distal up to 
50 kb). 
 
Correlations with TCGA data and pancreatic cancer data. 
The  normalized  ATAC-seq  peak  signals  (ID:  Peak1  =  PRAD_72732  and  Peak2  = 
PRAD_72733)  of  TCGA  tumor  samples  were  obtained  from  the  ATAC-seq  Hub

(https://atacseq.xenahubs.net)  (58).  Corresponding  gene  expression  quantification  of 
matching donors was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks Bioconductor package (73). Here 
we used the upper quartile normalized FPKM values. 
The accessibility signals for Peak1 and Peak2 were then plotted against the NR4A1 
expression. For the PANC1 cell line, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data were obtained through 
the  GEO  database  (GSE124229  and  GSE124231).  First,  the  gene  expression  and 
accessibility signals were normalized to the library size for each patient. The accessibility 
signal for Peak1 and Peak2 was then plotted against the NR4A1 expression.  On both, 
linear regression was used to model the correlation between the accessibility and gene 
expression signal in R v.4.1.2. Heatmaps were made using DeepTools v.3.4.3 (63) and 
pheatmap R package.
