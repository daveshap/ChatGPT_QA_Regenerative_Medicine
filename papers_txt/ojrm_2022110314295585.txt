1. Introduction 
Platelet rich plasma (PRP) has been shown to be efficient for many orthopedic 
diseases like tendinopathies (i.e., lateral epicondylitis [1], patellar tendinopathy 
[2], Achilles tendinopathy [3], shoulder impingement syndrome [4], rotator cuff 
tear [5], osteoarthritis knee [6], and avascular necrosis of femoral head [7]). The 
economic costs of orthopedic dysfunctions are high, including expenses related 
to treatment, MRI and radiographies, and those due to limited work productivi-
ty.  
In the current study, we emphasized on, the Osteoarthritis, the Chronic ten-
dinitis and the tennis elbow prevalent conditions of articular disabilities. 
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects 10% of the developed world population. Pa-
tients with KOA are at a higher lifetime risk compared to the general population 
by OA of 45% [8]. KOA is a joint disorder resulting from progressive articular 
damage affecting mostly the knees and the hips. Nowadays, there is no efficient 
treatment for KOA, non-indicative clinical data about the disease progression 
[9]. Anti-pain treatment and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are primordial and 
can be of benefit [8]. Surgery interventions to compensate or replace damaged 
tissue are also a treatment option [9]. Current guidelines recommend a combi-
nation  of  movement  exercises  and  drug  therapies  such  as  non-steroid  an-
ti-inflammatory molecules (NSAID) [10]. However, this treatment generally has 
temporary benefits and moderate outcomes in KOA patients. Furthermore, pa-
tients with comorbidities are not illegible for NSAID treatment. Recent study 
discussed that repeated injections protocol of Intra-articular glucocorticoids is 
associated  with  a  cartilage  loss  feature  is  generally  recommended  only  for 
short-term pain relief and a [11] [12]. The use of Hyaluronic acid (HA) is con-
troversial where guidelines offer restricted recommendations [12]. Despite these

non-curable treatment strategies for KOA, knee arthroplasty results as a defini-
tive treatment associated to an expensive cost, and a high risk of post-surgical 
medical complications [13]. Thus, an alternative non-invasive and safe treat-
ment for KOA is crucial. 
The Chronic Tendinitis (CT) disorder implicates serious complications and 
some treatment protocols with very poor curative effects, with high probabilities 
of relapse [14]. The root of the disease is a long-term excessive physical exercise, 
which causes an overstretch of the tissue surrounding the tendon. Inflammatory 
modifications occur and rub the tendon and the periorbital tissue [14] [15]. 
Then, chronic inflammation conducts the degeneration of the hyaline and fatty 
tissues of the tendon [16] and the spontaneous rupture of the Achilles tendon. 
Although, the treatment for Chronic tendinitis varies on the severity of the in-
jury, it mainly engages, nonsurgical methods, basically steroid hormone-blocking 
therapy [17], oral NSAID [18], and low-frequency ultrasound stimulation [19]. 
Steroids and lidocaine apply strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and 
are widely used for CT treatment in clinical practice [17] [19]. To date, the clin-
ical application of these anti-pain medications in the treatment of CT is largely 
controversial. 
The tennis elbow (TE) or lateral epicondylitisis one of the most common 
overuse syndromes related to excessive wrist extension [20]. TE is associated to 
angio-fibroblastic degeneration and collagen disarray [21]. On histological level, 
sections  reveal  fibroblasts  and  blood  vessels  consistent  with  neoangiogenic 
process [22]. TE pain can be reduced using physiotherapy tools [23], NSAID, 
and cortisone (steroid) injections [24]. Recent studies described that cortisone 
injections reduce inflammation over few months, where the healing process is 
always long to handle since the cortisone infiltration can destroy healthy tendon 
cells and increase the severity of the TE context for some patients [24].  
Biological components have been recently studied for KOA, CT and TE 
treatment such as MSCs and PRP. PRP is as autologous blood product enriched 
in platelets concentration [25] [26] [27]. Platelets are the natural healing cells 
recruited into the tissue injury [28]; in addition PRPs include antibacterial and 
fungicidal proteins, numerous growth factors (GFs) such as platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endo-
thelial  growth  factor  (VEGF),  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF),  insulin-like 
growth factor-I (IGF-I), fibroblastic growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth 
factor (HGF) [29] [30]. The liberation of these GFs is supposed to be allied to the 
PRP efficacy in wound healing [29]. Several clinical trials have shown that PRP 
may be promising for KOA, CT and TE treatment [31]. GFs are the effectors 
that improve the healing of tendon injuries treated by PRP injections. The use of 
PRP is rarely associated to medical complications and less invasive than other 
therapeutic options indicated for some patients, such as surgery [32] [33]. The 
PRP components especially the GFs and the fibrin matrix represent a potential 
biological tool for the healing process in orthopedics trauma after PRP treat-
ment.

The aim of this study is to determine whether a single high dose of PRP and 
plasma injection improve validated outcomes in patients with symptomatic 
KOA, CT and TE. Herein, we highlight the effect of PRP as a first treatment line 
for inflammatory joint problems and tendinopathies. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Study Design and Patient Selection 
This is a retrospective, experimental study. Thirty patients with Osteoarthritis, 
Chronic Tendinitis and Tennis Elbow were divided into 3 groups: Group A (n = 
10), Group B (n = 10) and Group C (n = 10), respectively. The Injection of the 
single high dose of PRP treatment took place on an outpatient clinic without the 
need for hospital admission. One session was performed per patient. All partici-
pants were aged between 26 and 58 years old (median age 42 years old) and were 
refractory to the usual conservative corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid treat-
ments. There were no exclusion criteria; all patients with OA, CT, and TE were 
included. 
All procedures run during the study were carried out in compliance with in-
stitutional ethical standards. Reviva Regenerative Medicine Center and the Mid-
dle East Institute of Health—University Hospital Ethics Review Boards approved 
the collection and processing of venous blood (Approval Reference Number Re-
viva-IRB-MEIH-005-21) and all patients were asked to read, approve, and sign 
an informed consent form prior to any participation. 
Patient evaluation and pain score: To evaluate disease progression and ex-
amine the regenerative power of the PRP, we used the Knee injury and Os-
teoarthritis Outcome Score—Physical Function Short Form (KOOS-PS) Arabic 
(KSA) version LK 1.0 for group A patient (Annex 1), HOOS-Physical Function 
Short form (HOOS-PS) for group B patients in (Annex 2), and Macdermid pa-
tient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation in group C patients (Annex 3). 
Adverse effects: patients with mild transient adverse events. Pain, rigidity and 
synovitis were the most common complaints. There were no lasting adverse ef-
fects to any participants.  
2.2. Preparation of Autologous PRP 
After obtaining patients’ consent and in order to prepare 30 different samples of 
PRP, venous blood was collected from patients using a sterile 20 ml syringe con-
taining ACD solution. Under a laminar flow hood, the blood was transferred to a 
50 ml centrifuge tube. The PRP preparation procedure consisted of two centri-
fugation steps. The initial centrifugation low speed for 15 min at room tempera-
ture separates the whole blood into three layers: an upper layer containing 
mostly platelets and WBC (White Blood Cells), an intermediate thin layer iden-
tified as the buffy coat rich in WBC, and a bottom layer that consists mostly of 
RBCs (Red Blood Cells). Most of the red blood cells were eliminated and the 
upper layer and buffy coat are transferred to an empty sterile tube and centri-

fuged at higher speed for 8 min for Platelet concentration and PRP collection. 
2.3. PRP Analysis 
VEGF, PDGF and Platelet Assay 
VEGF and PDGF were measured by ELISA. The supernatant and the antibody 
(monoclonal biotinyle) form a complex after the interaction of biotin and strep-
tavidin during incubation for 60 min. The excess was eliminated by washing and 
an enzyme-antibody complex is added. The complex antibody-enzyme formed 
the final sandwich complex. After incubation, the excess was washed again. Af-
terwards, sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction and the solution’s color 
transformed from blue to yellow. The color intensity was directly correlated to 
the concentration at 450 nm. The total leukocyte count was <2 in our PRP anal-
ysis. The PDGF concentration in the PRP ranged from 50,230 to 74,948 pg/ml 
(63,668 ± 12,968 pg/ml) and VEGF from 1368 to 2429 pg/ml (1788 ± 1245 
pg/ml).  
All blood samples were drawn in ACDA-anticoagulated blood and run on a 
Sysmex SE 9500 in the main Laboratory within 15 min of phlebotomy. The base-
line platelet count ranged from 1.89 to 2.90 × 105 platelet/μl (mean 2.0 × 105 
platelet/μl). The PRP concentrate had a platelet count ranging from 12.55 to 15.8 × 
105 platelet/μl (mean 13.88 ± 1.76 × 105 platelet/μl) with a recovery of 90% 
(87.4% - 92.6%). The total platelet count injected ranged from 10.14 to 10.83 bil-
lion (10.45 ± 0.46) in a total volume of 3 mlg.  
2.4. Injection Procedure 
After the collection of blood and PRP preparation (described above), the area 
where the PRP will be injected was cleaned with Povidone Iodine (Betadine®) 
swab to be disinfected. 
For the injection in the Knee, many approaches can be adopted starting from 
either above the knee going to the side (superolateral injection), as well as from 
the above going to the middle (superomedial). Furthermore, another injection 
method could be going from the front toward the middle (anteromedial) or the 
side (anterolateral). In this study, for knee injection, supero-lateral approach had 
been adopted because it provides a better access and is less difficult than the 
others.  
The superolateral injection starts by drawing a line from the apex of the Patel-
la laterally to the Lateral Pole and another line to the medial pole with the upper 
border of the Patella being the base of the triangle. The needle can then be in-
serted into the half point of the lateral line directed toward the intra-articular 
space of the knee. 
For tennis elbow injection, a 25 G needle is inserted over the center of Lateral 
Epicondyle either at 45 or 90 degrees of the skin with a 0.6 - 1.6 cm depth. 
For tendinitis injection, needles used depend on the weights of patients, where 
the goal is to reach the greater trochanteric bursa where the PRP will be injected.

2.5. Statistical Analysis  
Subgroup  analysis  included  (single  vs  bilateral)  and  duration  of  symptom 
(≤median vs > median duration). The median duration of symptoms was deter-
mined by the baseline data. We performed an omnibus (likelihood ratio χ2) test 
for treatment-subgroup interaction in a model for the primary outcome. P value 
of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).  
3. Results   
KOOPS-PS, HOOPS-PS and the Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation ques-
tionnaires were used to calculate specific scores for each activity. These scores 
were used to evaluate and compare the pre- and post-injection status for the 
knee, hip and tennis elbow, respectively. Concerning the knee injections, seven 
criteria were used to evaluate the efficacy of the injections: rising from bed, 
putting on socks, rising from sitting, bending to floor, twisting/pivoting on the 
injured knee, kneeling and squatting. The difficulties in the execution of each of 
the above-mentioned tasks diminished after the injections, mainly from Se-
vere/Extreme before the injection to Moderate/Mild after injections. The average 
and median values of the scores are represented in Table 1. *Significant im-
provement from baseline at one month the decrease observed in the calculated 
scores is statistically significant (p < 0.05). 
Regarding the hip injections, five criteria were tested: Descending stairs, get-
ting in/out of the shower, sitting, running and twisting/pivoting on the loaded 
leg. The intensity of the difficulties in accomplishing the aforementioned tasks 
decreased significantly after injections, (the average and median in Table 2), ex-
cept for “twisting/pivoting on the loaded leg” that showed similar results pre- 
and post-injection. *Significant improvement from baseline at one month the 
decrease observed in the calculated scores is statistically significant (p < 0.05). 
As for the tennis elbow injections, four criteria were taken into consideration 
to evaluate the efficacy of the injections: Pain subscale, specific activities, usual

arms decreased after injections only in the “pain subscale” section, the average

ties and function subscale) showed similar results before and after injections. 
*Significant improvement from baseline at one month the decrease observed in

4. Discussion 
According to our study, in one month after injection, the patients of all three 
groups showed significantly lower scores KOOPS-PS, HOOPS-PS and Macder-
mid Lequesne, compared to their primary assessment before the injections 
(baseline levels). Based on the results, the HA and corticosteroid had signifi-
cantly lower scores after one month of follow up post injection. It is clear that 
the corticosteroid and HA therapy in OA, CT and TA has some early beneficial 
but not long lasting effects. Our results demonstrated that 1-high dose injection 
of PRP seemed to have significant improvement. Compared to a meta-analysis 
conducted on a limited number of studies (n = 5) to evaluate the efficacy 
amongst different PRP injection therapies [34], our study, include more patients 
(n = 30) more specific clinical outcomes at different periods of follow-ups were 
compared; Our results could provide more information about the efficacy of 
high dose of PRP injection therapies especially for treating mild-moderate KOA, 
CT and TE.  
Our results indicate that high dose of a single injection of PRP maintain pain 
relief after a one month of follow up compared to the HA and corticosteroid 
several injection treatments.

In conformity with our study, a previous meta-analysis performed by Raeis-
sadat et al. showed that the corticosteroid and HA effects were maintained of 4 - 
6 months’ post-injection [35]. EceUslu Guvendi et al. have also shown that, in 
comparison to PRP, patients treated with corticosteroid and HA have expe-
rienced earlier improvement in OA symptoms, however PRP had long an-
ti-inflammatory effect compared to corticosteroid and HA therapy [32]. Gaballa 
et al. showed that corticosteroid and HA were able to reduce the score at the 
same level of PRP injections at the 1st month post-injection, unlikely three 
months post injections, patient who received corticosteroid and HA therapy 
showed higher scores than the PRP-injected patients [36]. Interestingly we found 
that a single high dose PRP injection has much long-term benefit effects com-
pared to the study of Sara j et al. [36], in KOA mainly respond from se-
vere/extreme before the injection to moderate/mild after injections, as for the TE 
the average amount of pain in the patients’ arms decreased after injections, fi-
nally for the CT The intensity of the difficulties in accomplishing the aforemen-
tioned tasks decreased significantly after injections. Our study is close my con-
sistent with the meta-analysis results of Jatupon Kongtharvonskul et al. where 
PRP was shown more benefit than autologous blood injection or steroid injec-
tions for patient with tennis elbow disease [37]. PRP injection and autologous 
blood injection display an improvement in disability scores and pressure pain 
threshold when compared with steroid injection. However, side effects are high-
er risks with autologous blood injection compared to PRP and steroid injections.  
Several clinic trials revealed only short-term effects of corticosteroid injection 
within rotator cuff lesions. A recent clinical trial (Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov 
(Identifier: NCT02588872) showed that HA and PRP injections improve same 
pain score at any time point in the primary outcome measure. Interestingly, sig-
nificant improvements were seen in other outcome measures, favoring PRP over 
HA. The study suggests that a decrease in 2 pro-inflammatory cytokines in the 
PRP injected patients, contribute to an improvement of symptoms [38].  
Otherwise, corticosteroid and PRP were shown to reduce inflammation, how-
ever corticosteroid and HA don’t belong to any biological regenerative mechan-
ism impacting negatively their long-term anti-inflammation role. In our study, 
we demonstrated that single high dose PRP injection can be a rapid benefit for 
functional recovery and pain relief compared to corticosteroid and HA injection 
at both medium- and long-term follow-up. Significant improvement of PRP sin-
gle high dose injection compared to baseline level was observed at one month of 
follow-up, the decrease in the outcomes score is statistically significant (p < 0.05) 
in OA, CT and TE patients. 
PRP infiltrations have been widely used for the treatment of OA, CT and TE 
with many beneficial results. In our study, intra-articular PRP injections were 
well tolerated. We managed to reduce the mild synovitis within the first week 
after injection.  
Treatment with single high dose of PRP injections was shown to be safe since 
no complications have been reported. We suggest that single high dose of PRP is

a safe non-invasive procedure with a very limited risk of infectious diseases 
transmission. 
Based on the discussed evidence, comparing three active treatments for pa-
tients with OT, CT, and TE single high dose of PRP injection showed the best 
result on pain reducing after one month, whereas corticosteroid, HA injection 
and the NSAID showed the best score improving disabilities and pressure thre-
shold. 
5. Conclusion and Perspective 
We found that PRP is a potential alternative option for KOA, CT and TE treat-
ment. Our study attempts to provide additional information about the efficacy of 
the single high dose of PRP injection amongst various PRP, corticosteroids and 
HA injections therapies among patients with tendinopathies and arthritis; Ac-
cording to the current evidence, the single use of a high dose of PRP shows a 
significant improvement on pain and ROM scores. Considering the side effect of 
corticosteroids which are never indicated for some patients with a high risk of 
tendon rupture, we suggest the use of single high dose PRP instead of corticos-
teroid and HA injections among patients with OA, CT and TE. 
However, the study design was not high-level evidence for long-term fol-
low-up, so more studies should be further conducted to confirm these results. 
The cost-effective analysis comparing PRP injections, corticosteroid and HA 
injections or the combination of physiotherapy should be evaluated on pain, 
disabilities, pressure pain threshold and risk of side effects outcomes. For the 
medium and long-term follow-up, high dose single PRP injection is in favor of 
long-lasting articular benefits and cartilage regeneration process. Additional 
studies with longer follow-up time points and larger sample sizes are a must to 
confirm  our  observations  and  to  draw  more  refined  conclusions  about 
PRP-based therapy for KOA, Ct and TE patients.
