Article: Upper extremity exomuscle for shoulder abduction support (continued)

Range of Motion Testing: Motion capture was used to measure upper extremity range of motion in participants while they performed tasks with no assistance, with exomuscle support, and with ceiling support. Shoulder rotation was also assessed with no assistance and with exomuscle support.

Results: The exomuscle did not impede the motion of the upper extremity while supporting shoulder abduction. There was no difference in muscle activations recorded in the two support conditions (exomuscle and ceiling support) at an Î± = 0.05 confidence level in either task.

Conclusion: The exomuscle effectively supports shoulder abduction without impeding the motion of the upper extremity in unimpaired participants.
